# TRIANGULUM
The relationship between cannabis, tobacco and e-cigarettes (The "Triangulum") is both rapidly changing and poorly understood, with consumers increasingly shifting between all three products. This project provides insights into product initiation patterns, use patterns, and cessation strategies.

This package was written in Python 2.7.
