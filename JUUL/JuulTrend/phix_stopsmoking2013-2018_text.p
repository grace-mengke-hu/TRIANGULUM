aVNicotine withdrawal?\u000a\u000aHey everyone, I have a few questions regarding nicotine withdrawal.\u000a\u000aSo I used to be addicted to cigs but quit that and substituted it for even higher nicotine electric cigarettes, like juul or  phix. I went from hitting one a few times a day to burning through pods in 2-3 days on some occasions (4 juul pods = 1 pack of cigs, 4 phix pods = 2 packs of cigs). Both were about 50mg nicotine. After I stopped getting buzzes I moved onto breezes which hit so much harsher and had such a better headrush. \u000a\u000aWell, anyways, now i've gone cold turkey to all nicotine products. I'm on my 5th day and for now doing good but i was craving nicotine so much it was insane. I never acknowledged how addicted I was until I tried to kick it and it's been near impossible. How long will these cravings last? Thanks for any advice

aVVape vs cigarettes\u000a\u000aI'm 32 days cigarette free!!! And I've been using a phix vape to control my urges. I puff on it a lot and plan to slow down when the time is right. I read online how vaping is so much better for you than smoking. But also read it's as dangerous as smoking. For me, I feel a million times better vaping then I ever did smoking. I can breath normally and work out just fine. What are your thoughts?????

aVI Lost My Juul and I\u2019m Tempted to go buy a Phix\u000a\u000a
p4
aVI\u2019m confused by what you mean were you trying to make a joke with phix and fix? Should I buy it or no
p5
aVI wasn't trying to make a joke, but it is interesting that a drug delivery device was name "phix".\u000a\u000aI encourage you to stop using nicotine in any form. No cigs, vape, ecig, dip, snus, and so on.
p6
aVYeah but I\u2019m a college student who often finds himself around bars with teenagers smoking. I try hard not to ask but I always do and a device like a Phix is better than being a bum.

aVnervous for my health\u000a\u000aI've never posted on reddit before, so I'm not sure if I'm posting in the right spot but whatever. I just need some answers for some questions after scaring the shit out of myself from looking at anti smoking commercials.\u000a\u000aI will currently not disclose my current age however, at the age of 14 I started to smoke(cigs,vaping,hookah) as well as another array of substances I should not be doing. My question is just if I have really only smoked about less than 3 packs of cigarettes in my life, will it affect me in the future? \u000a\u000aI currently vape out of devices such as a Juul or Phix so I'm not sure if this will still make me prone to things such as cancer, but I have completely stopped smoking cigarettes.\u000a\u000a

aVI need help quitting nicotine.\u000a\u000aI tried cigarettes and I quit then easily I couldn't stand the smell but I switched to vape a little one like a Juul but it's called a phix, has a shit ton of nicotine loaded and it gets me so buzzed to the point I'm numb or can't drive. Been like 8 months on this and still works great, never really tried to stop but I know I can't because I'm always like I just want a little buzz it's okay. \u000a\u000aIt's gotten so bad, I don't want this to be my lifestyle and I literally can't go a day without getting atleast a big buzz in morning, 3 throughout the day and a shitton at night. What do I do what are ways I can stop because it's so fucking hard I get headaches and feel like shit. I am really trapped. Help me please.

aV3 weeks in, feeling strong\u000a\u000aI've posted here in the past but never have been able to get past 3 weeks, but I'm about to in 14 hours! I've been using the phix e-cig and i really enjoy it.  I like the original tobacco flavor the best because it gives me the throats hit of an actual boge.  Even if it costs me more in the long run than buying packs, I don't care because I'm not smoking cigarettes!

aVA week into attempt number 2\u000a\u000aI made it from October to February and then fell off. I\u2019m using a phix e-cigarette and the smoke free app. I used the app last time but got lazy, when I checked it again to see all the time that would have passed, the health progress and the money I would have saved I felt really guilty. I\u2019m really trying again, it\u2019s been just over a week and I feel fine right now, but I still find smoking to be so attractive. Also having a bit of an identity crisis considering myself a non smoker. I have a hard time with the mantra, and picturing myself having \u201cnot one puff ever again\u201d, but that was my problem the last time, and I made so many excuses for smoking. Any advice from you all beating this thing would be a big help.

aVRight here w you pal. Honesty, going the vape route isn't a bad way to go. Invest in a juul or a phix and taper down from that
p12
aVFor me quitting cigs was easier then my fucking phix dude, i was so addicted to nic it was crazy. those cool melon pods were my heroin
