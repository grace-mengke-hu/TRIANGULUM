VQuitting vaping?\u000a\u000aI hope this is the right community but it seems to be the best bet since there\u2019s no /r/stopvaping! I\u2019ve never smoked regularly (aside from a few cigarettes bummed off friends), but I have been addicted to nicotine for about 6 months due to me stupidly buying a juul to fit in with the trends. I was recently informed of some medical reasons that might make nicotine affect me more negatively than most, and decided it would probably be best to stop.\u000a\u000aI tried cold turkey for a few days and it wasn\u2019t that hard, but I quickly lost motivation and went back. For me, the physical cravings weren\u2019t that bad, it was more of the routine of vaping that kept bugging me. Hitting my weed vape helped a lot, but obviously I don\u2019t want to be high 24/7 so I can\u2019t always use that.\u000a\u000aSo I was wondering from anyone who has quit or tried to quit vaping: would it be worth buying a Suorin with 0mg nicotine juice to maintain the routine of vaping while still going \u201ccold turkey\u201d from nicotine? Or will that lead to additional problems that a full quit wouldn\u2019t create?\u000a\u000aI know I could taper nic levels but I\u2019d rather get it over with quickly, so I\u2019m kinda set on a 0 nicotine path forward. I\u2019m also aware of the dangers of inhaling any particulate, and I do eventually intend to stop vaping altogether, but my immediate medical need is to stop nicotine. So I\u2019m just wondering if anyone has tried going straight to 0mg juice and if it\u2019s easier than no vaping at all.\u000a\u000aThanks!!

aVI've been smoking cigarettes for 30 years &amp; weed for 20. Now using a Suorin Air vape to quit smoking. Quit date is 2 days from now. And a Clear oil pen for weed. My dad passed away at 63 from cancer. I don't want to take that same road.

aVGet a suorin - they give a very similar sensation to juuls, only you have more control over the juice (plus, they're cheaper). There are probably other e-cig devices that are similar, but this is what I'm familiar with. \u000a\u000aThen, buy one 35mg juice and one 0mg juice. Start with the 35mg juice - it's already less than juuls (which are about 50mg), then every time you refill, start titrating the 35mg juice with the 0mg juice. You'll get less and less nicotine every time until you are (hopefully!) down to 0mg.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;
p3
aVThat actually looks like a good solution too. I think a big part of things is just that I feel like I need to do the act of smoking... Any suggestion on which Suorin is best? Or are they all about the same? Thanks!
p4
aVThey're all similar, but I personally like the Suorin Air! It's small and easily fits in your wallet (kinda the shape / size of a credit card). It has the best battery life too. It doesn't hit quite as hard as the Suorin Drop, but if you're planning on quitting that's probably an advantage. 
p5
aVwoah bro, i was literally just about to describe that. it feels like adderall except with no euphoria. such a weird feeling. i used to smoke two juul pods a day, but i switched to a suorin vagon, and ran through an entire refillable pod until the cotton burned, and i couldnt use it anymore
p6
aVLink to the Suorin Vagon?\u000a\u000aI\u2019m thinking of getting a non-nic vape to see if it\u2019s just a mental thing. \u000a\u000a
p7
aVyou can just type suorin vagon in on google, and tons of stuff will pop up. and no bro non nic is useless, dont waste ur money

aVNeed Advice - Going with Family to Mexico, Quit Now or Later?\u000a\u000aHi all! \u000a\u000aI'm addicted to vaping (I use a suorin, which is similar to a juul), and I'm really embarrassed about it. I started smoking cigarettes after a bad break up, and after beginning to mooch my friends' juuls a lot, I ended up buying it myself. I really regret it and want to quit soon, I guess I just haven't found the right "time". For reference, I'm a 20 YO college student. \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aI'm going down to Mexico with my family tomorrow. We're driving across the border. I'm really worried that my suorin is going to get confiscated at the border, or at least get pulled out and checked. My parents don't know I smoke and would (rightfully) freak out if they did. \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aSo I'm presented with a few options:\u000a\u000a1. Bring it anyway, hide it in my bag and hope nobody searches our stuff. Hopefully quit soon. \u000a2. Don't bring it, and use this as an excuse to start quitting. The reason I'm hesitant to do this is that I know I will be really moody during the first period of nicotine withdrawals, and I don't want to ruin our family vacation. \u000a3. Purchase nicotine gum/nicotine patches to prevent withdrawals but jumpstart me quitting. To me, this seems like the best option, but I'm only 20 and can't legally buy them in my state. I have a fake ID that I've been using to buy cigs / vape stuff, but I feel like most of the places that I buy from are pretty lenient on IDs and I'm worried my fake wouldn't work at a normal drug store.\u000a4. ???\u000a\u000aThank you for reading. I would love to hear your advice and support. I feel like an idiot right now for letting myself get into this situation. \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;
p9
aVThank you for your reply! \u000a\u000aI've already started reducing my nic-level (part of the reason I chose a suorin over a juul, since there's more freedom in choosing your juice. I started at 50mg, currently at 35mg), and am planning on continuing to do so.\u000a\u000a I've started to get a little lazy about it, but my anxiety over this situation reminded me of how important it is that I continue. 
p10
aVI think that Juuls and Suorin Drops are the best things that emulate that harsh hit that Dark Blue american spirits and Malboro Reds have. You might also want to try either a higher mg one or a strong flavored juice.\u000a\u000aAlso Juuls and Suorins are a little more similar to the way you would hit a cigarette, because regular vapes have a different kind of "Inhale" if you get what I'm saying.
p11
aVWhat I\u2019ve been doing is get like a smok novo or sourin and every time I buy a bottle I go down in the amount of nic
p12
aVHaving trouble quitting nicotine devices\u000a\u000aI quit smoking cigarettes by switching over the suorin, juul, etc.. Now this has become an issue. The max I can go without it is a day and I start fiending. Thing is i'm around my friends a lot and they also have it on them at all times. I gave mine for my friend to hold as well but it is still now helping. Any tips would be great

aV19 y/o, quit cold turkey 2.5 months ago.\u000a\u000aStarted vaping 3mg nicotine e-liquid at 16. Within a year I was smoking cigarettes instead; eventually quit cigarettes with the help of vaping and moved up to 6mg, 12mg nicotine e-liquid. By 18 I was hitting a suorin with 50mg nicotine e-liquid in it, all day every day.\u000a\u000aAnd then one day, on a whim, I just threw the device in the trash at a fast food establishment before leaving. Haven\u2019t had any nicotine since September. \u000a\u000aUsed nicotine for 3 years and always told myself I could quit whenever I wanted to; when I decided I wanted to, I just did. GG no re

aV15 days free of Nicotine(Use this as motivation)\u000a\u000aFifteen days ago I was extremely addicted to nicotine. I would vape 50nic from a Sourin. Would go through 2 ml a day (Equivilent to 2 packs of cigarettes based on nicotine content). It all started 4 years ago when I was a junior when I started to dip, and it started to be an every day habbit untill I quit dipping in September of 2017 and I decided to buy a juul.\u000a\u000aMy vaping problem was starting to be tough on my body. I always felt on edge, always felt wired.\u000a\u000aThen I made the decision to quit, and to change my life around. These 15 days have been sober from all stimulants. I feel absolutely amazing.\u000a\u000aI now have a girlfriend, we started talking 3 weeks ago, and I used her as my motivation to quit, because nicotine often caused me Impotence. Now I feel insanely healthy in all aspects of my life. I know I can't contribute all of these effects to nicotine abstinence. But what I can tell you guys is that your mind is powerful, and it can do and change things if you truely believe in yourself.\u000a\u000aI don't have cravings anymore. I know that everyone is different, but it really was not that hard for me. 
p15
aVSweet. I just filled my sourin drop vape with the last of my 50mg juice. After this is gone I'm going cold turkey. Been using about a pod full a day for 3 months now. It got me off cigs but this shit feels way more controling. We. Can do it. 
p16
aVFor about 7 years I NEVER got past day 6-9. I\u2019m now 34 days without a single cigg, and what totally turned things around was buying a Suorin Drop. It\u2019s not the perfect solution because there is still some tobacco. But it got me through every craving. Now I\u2019m even at the point where I only use it once or twice every 3 or 4 days. I can honestly say it has made quitting 10000 times easier, I genuinely don\u2019t want a cig anymore 
p17
aVIf you know you're going to relapse, you could at least do it with a vape. Suorin, Juul, Smok Rolo all feel close to a cigarette when you use strong nicotine salts. That's what I'm doing right now. I'm considering smoking an emergency that needs to stop immediately, and I can deal with quitting the vape eventually. I just know myself and going cold turkey is a bad plan for me. 
p18
aVI hate cigarettes now, so it\u2019s great and I feel like I won\u2019t go back to anything that smells as bad as smokes now. It\u2019s a means to an end and I am determined to not go back to cigarettes.\u000a\u000aTo be honest though, it took me a while to get back to vaping because I started with this big kit 5 years ago, but it was a mid/low nicotine level (sorry, I don\u2019t remember) with no side effects. Then a couple years ago when marlboro came out with their vape pen, I tried it and it made me feel worse than cigarettes especially with cardio, so I stopped.\u000a\u000aBut I finally went to a shop, and asked all my questions there. I got this [no button pen type vape](https://www.suorinusa.com/products/suorin-vagon) w/35mg salt nicotine (which I hear is smoother, and I liked more than the other stuff) that hits pretty smooth, and while it\u2019s not the same nicotine high, it\u2019s just for those panicky I need a smoke type moments, and it\u2019s getting me through the day.\u000a\u000aI guess I\u2019ve accepted that nothing is ever going to be like a cigarette, and I\u2019m still a little hooked to the idea of smoking, but I\u2019m getting over it. Vaping is my crutch in the meantime and I\u2019m glad I found one that\u2019s helping me get there.

aVA WORKING smoking ALTERNATIVE if you can't QUIT.\u000a\u000aHi everyone, I've been around many smokers in my life and most didn't have the will power to quit completely. This will ultimately lead to bad health effects in the future for them. Everyone knows it's better to not inhale anything, than to. The problem with smoking is not only that your burning tobacco, but the ingredients that your burning creates further problems. Your will start to cough up black tar, and it will get hard to breathe. \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aSO what's the ALTERNATIVE to QUIT?!\u000a\u000aMany smokers don't take this method seriously, and pass it off as just as harmful. Despite most doctors agreeing it is at least 95%-99% healthier than smoking. Once smokers have switched to "this method" they have seen that they are no longer coughing up black tar, breathing has become easier, and overall they can expect to now live longer. \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aThe alternative to quit smoking, is VAPING. There have been many test done, recently some on YouTube showing one month of smoking vs one month of vaping. Let's just say that one cigarette turned out to leave worse results than a whole month of vaping. In this test, they used cotton balls to act as the lungs. Then they used air pressure to suck in either the vapor or smoke, and it would be blow out another tube on the opposite side. With smoking, black tar was left everywhere.. but with vaping the cotton was clear white with a little moisture on it. A fun fact, scientist say you inhale more water vapor when showering then you do when vaping. So, does this confirm the 99% safer claim? Well, not completely but we can definitely see that is is much safer.. we just cant 100% estimate how safe it is exactly.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aWHY is it SO HARD to QUIT?!\u000a\u000aWell, first off you're most likely addicted to nicotine. Now you ask "doesn't vaping contain nicotine?"\u000a\u000aYes, but no. You can get it with nicotine, and you can also get it without it. Many people think nicotine is the harmful part in cigarettes, when in reality most scientist say it's just as harmful as caffeine. Switching to vaping will provide you with the same experience as smoking, just with more flavor options, and less health effects. \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aMy WHOLE POINT in this LONG essay?\u000a\u000aIf your addicted to nicotine and you don't want to quit it, why smoke cigarettes when there is a healthier and more enjoyable nicotine alternative out there? There are small vape devices that resemble a cigarette such as the JUUL, you can also look into the Suorin Air. I would suggest getting a high nicotine e-liquid when you're first quitting. I've seen the high content really keep most former smokers off of the bad stuff.   \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aIF you WANT to try VAPING:\u000a\u000aI do work at an online vape shop, and yes that vape shop is VapeGodShop. We offer all reddit users 10% off EVERY order. Simply use code "reddit10" at checkout.

aVIf you're having a hard time quitting completely, there is always the option of getting an e-cig or vape. These are no doubt much healthier and the cost is definitely lower. Nicotine isn't the harmful part of ciggs, it's the chemicals. This is just an option if you're finding it impossible to quit, if you can quit completely then awesome! If not, I would recommend checking out products such as the JUUL or Suorin Air. Search "VapeGodShop" on google and you can browse what we have to offer. Use code "reddit10" at checkout for 10% off.

aVOver 3 weeks without a cigarette!!!\u000a\u000aI don't know if this counts, because I bought a Sourin Air (vape thing similar to a juul) so I still am addicted to nicotine. However, I'm working on weening myself off by lowering the nicotine amount gradually.\u000a\u000aI'm only 20, and I started smoking at 18 because I'm in the military and everyone uses tobacco. It's a great way to get a break and relieves stress in times when there's plenty of it to go around. I got up to over a pack a day and a few weeks ago I just decided enough was enough. \u000a\u000aEvery couple days though I feel a burning desire to light one up, but it usually passes quickly. I know it's not much of a milestone but I'm just happy to not be smoking cigarettes and wanted to share :)
p23
aVI need help to get my SO to stop smoking\u000a\u000aWe passed her date to stop smoking about a week ago and she doesn't seem to have the will to do it. I smoked cigs way back when we first started dating but now we have a 15month child together in the same appt and I can't understand how she hasn't been able to stop. She has been taking Chantix and has cut down to 4 a day instead of close to a pack but it seems impossible for her to take that next step to completely stopping. Shes tried the Suorin but always seems to misplace it and just goes back to smoking cigs. I need help.
p24
aVPeople can make fun all they want but the fact of the matter is that I was addicted to nicotine and chose to stop. I started with the juul in college and later got a suorin on 50mg of nic. Loved the fucking thing but it had to go
p25
aVHey! Struggling still, but haven\u2019t puffed a smoke. Hitting a suorin vape and it\u2019s helping tremendously. 
p26
aVRealized I need to quit while I\u2019m ahead\u000a\u000aI\u2019m not sure if this is quite the place for this, because it\u2019s not smoking, but vaping and nicotine addiction in general.  I also don\u2019t mean to marginalize anyone else\u2019s addiction to nicotine with my own brief stint, but I wanted to share.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m a 17 year old who just graduated high school, and of course, everyone around me is vaping.  I\u2019d tried it a few times, and I enjoyed the nicotine buzz, so I figured I\u2019d purchase my own vape to have around the house.  I bought a suorin air, and it came in a week ago.  I also bought 50 mg nicotine salt juice, because if I was going to use it, I might as well catch a buzz.  Since it came in, I\u2019ve been wary of using it too much, because I recognized that nicotine was addictive and I know I have an addictive personality.  However, tonight, as I sat at home with nothing better to do, I realized that despite not particularly wanting to, I kept reaching for my suorin to take a couple puffs.  The nicotine made me feel REALLY good.  It felt better today after fighting the urge to vape than it did when I first picked it up, and for the first time, I was able to face the truth I had been trying to avoid since I started:  For me, I don\u2019t believe there is any way for me to use nicotine without becoming addicted.  The second I accepted that, I got up, walked outside to my dumpster, and threw my vape right in.\u000a\u000aI got lucky.  I spent $40 total on the vape, the juice, and the cartridges before I realized what a beast nicotine was.  I realized I didn\u2019t want to live a life controlled by nicotine, regardless of whether it\u2019s \u201chealthier than cigarettes\u201d or not.  I have a whole new level of respect for people trying to quit smoking, because if I could feel that way after only a week of regular use, I can\u2019t imagine the difficulty of trying to quit after years of use.  I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d have the strength to do what you guys are doing, so I hope I can provide you a little encouragement in letting you know that your battles with nicotine have helped me to avoid one of my own.
p27
aVYou might not need a whole giant rig, I've been using the suorin Air(it's literally business card sized) and it packs a punch.
p28
aVThose little Vapes are great (IMO) I got a suorin Air and am very impressed.
p29
aVJUULS are great, I have one too. However I am wanting to get a Sourin only because you can buy different juices for the Sourin with a lower Nic content 
p30
aVGood for you! I went from cigarettes to a juul to a little refillable sourin air. I\u2019m going to start cutting out nic as soon as the current bottle of juice I have is empty. I\u2019m pretty excited to give it a try
p31
aVI was 459 days off cigarettes.\u000a\u000aI've recently relapsed into cigarettes. Hear me out. I'm a casual vaper and it worked well for me. I go out sometimes and whether I'm shitfaced, just having a couple drinks with dinner, or completely sober, I have felt no need to smoke cigarettes. The only thing I crave from cigarettes is that first cigarette of the day nicotine rush. That's something that vaping can't competewith, even if i raised my nic levels to 6/12mg. I've even tried things such as the Suorin Air with nicotine levels up to 50mg. It just doesn't work for me. I'll be on ciggs for a little bit before I attempt to cold turkey again.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI am a disappointed in myself.
p32
aVI wouldn't suggest it. I use a suorin drop with salt, and any time I get it in my mouth it tastes terrible. Non salt juices don't taste too bad and have a lower nicotine content. I have no idea the implicationsof applying it directly to your gums otherwise, but it doesn't seem like it would be pleasant on a regular basis. 
p33
aVUsing vaping as a method to quit\u000a\u000aHi everyone,\u000a\u000aI recently have decided to try to quit smoking and to much of my surprise switching from cigs to the sourin drop was done with semi ease. I guess why I\u2019m posting here is I\u2019m wondering if anyone else had made the switch and if it really counts as quitting since I\u2019m still dependent on the vape? Any help is appreciated I\u2019m continually hard on myself for using it but am terrified of quitting
p34
aVJuul pods are crazy expensive. I\u2019d recommend getting a sourin drop and buying your own nic salts if you don\u2019t wanna break the bank
p35
aVYeah I had a suorin for a bit but I would just rip that legit all the time haha. It\u2019s soo convenient
p36
aVRight?? My withdrawals from cigs right now are way easier than my suorin withdrawals last quarter.
