aVJUUL by PAX
p2
aVI've got a JUUL for a CIG a like style. It's not circular, it's rectangular so it looks "odd" but it definitely does a decent job of replicating the cigarette style sensation better than the bigger devices. \u000a\u000aTheir tobacco flavor isn't half bad either (better than Vuze) and the vapor production is solid and on par with a real cigarette. \u000a\u000aThe best part is I picked up the JUUL while traveling so I could have something smaller than my mod and I'm still using it a month or two later. It's not my primary device buy I still use about 1/4 of a cartridge per day. 
p3
aVStart him out with the pax juul. I was a super heavy smoker and has attempted unsuccessfully to make the switch time and again. And tried pretty much all the different styles of devices. None did the trick until I came across the juul. It drags so much like a cigarette, there are no buttons to press, and it is ultra portable. I bought a couple of them so I could already keep one charged and alternate flavors through out the day while getting accustomed to inhaling vapor instead of smoke. Also the juice is something special it really kicks the shit out of the nicotine cravings and that is key to not getting too frustrated early on. I still use mine when I'm drinking and feeling week. Lol there is a good article on them below. Seriously can't recommend them enough. I never thought I could make the switch.\u000ahttp://www.wired.com/2015/04/pax-juul-ecig/

aVDifference between E-Cig (Juul) and a real vape machine?

aVYou can buy their juice and fill a juul pod with it after some tinkering. Just YouTube it.

aVSunflower Pipe's Juul by Pax Product Review
p7
aVIt's the same stuff as a fog machine with nicotine added. Not just "water vapor" but also not very harmful at all. I was bitched at recently for using my vape at a concert that made heavy use of a fog machine recently. Things almost got heated, mainly because moron couldn't realize that the fog machine was pumping out more vapor than my little JUUL ever could. Morons.
p8
aVI have a ton of vape setups and they're great and got me off cigs but recently I needed something small and discreet to use at customer sites for work when I didn't want to blow clouds outside their buildings.  I picked up a Juul kit because I liked that it didn't look like a cigarette, wasn't owned by Big Tobacco and heard the flavors were decent.  It is by far the closest to a cigarette experience I've found, the nic hit is instant and powerful and the flavors are actually really good.  They're not cheap but I would highly recommend buying one to use for those times you feel like you really need a cig, I think it would be very effective for that.
p9
aVpax juul is tiny
p10
aVI have a Juul in my work bag for super stealth vape at customer sites when needed and it works well enough nic/flavor wise.  It's nice too being able to see how much liquid you have left but they're pricey.\u000a\u000aQuit for a couple weeks using Blu's, not a huge fan of the disposables but the higher priced ones got the job done for a bit but I was ready to give up when I decided to visit a vape shop instead of buy a pack of cigarettes.

aVJuul Review from a Light Smoker
p13
aVNew "e-Cig" called Juul...sounds a little interesting. Thoughts?
p14
aVThe Juul is what you'd get if VUSE and TARS of Intersteller mated and had a love child.
p15
aVYa I really, really want a Pax based on what everyone has said. I just still can't justify the price for the device. Maybe for my birthday or something. If this Juul is as good they may have a killer product.
p16
aV"You do look a little like you plugged a USB stick into your mouth when you use it, but it\u2019s undeniably cooler than that insipid mess of tubes and glowsticks you\u2019re probably using now." \u000a\u000a"... there\u2019s something wonderfully satisfying about dropping it into the magnetic charger. (Magnets!) If you wave the Juul around, it lights up in a rainbow of colors."\u000a\u000aSorta the same thing, ain't it?
p17
aVHave you considered picking up a pen type vape and a high nicotine juice for when those cravings become unbearable? Maybe an iCare? A Juul? 
p18
aVGet a JUUL
p19
aVI would recommend the juul. Very low maintenance, easy to use, and has the perfect amount of nicotine for someone looking to quit smoking.
p20
aVRipTrippers recommends the juul ecig for newcomers to vaping from smoking. I'd recommend looking into that. It might be a little more expensive over long term but it's simple and a good way to get exposed to vaping.\u000a\u000aYouTube "riptrippers juul" to watch an overview.
p21
aVGet him a Juul. I have 3 co-workers that haven't smoked in over a year because of this cig-a-like. It may not look like much but I know it does the job. Good luck
p22
aVJuul with tobacco flavor is the closest to a cigarette I have tried, by far. Plus no refilling even? Costs a bit but much cheaper than all those cigarettes I bet, even if not it can allow him to get off of them and maybe switch to a cheaper vaping alternative
p23
aVI'd recommend the Myjet over the juul. It's the same device but you have the option of filling your own cartridges instead of worrying about buying pre fill cartridges. 
p24
aVOr an eleaf icare. Unless there is somewhere that keeps juul carts in stock he will go right back to smoking. The myjet and icare are great low cost all in ones that don't rely on refilled cartridges.
p25
aVIf you want coil heads - nautilus mini. If you don't mind building - Kayfun Mini V1/2/3.\u000a\u000a\u000a**EDIT:** Or a Juul. Those are great to quit smoking (or so I hear) and probably resemble a cigarette more than a bigger(ish), more cumbersome(ish) setup like those I mentioned above.
p26
aVFormer Juul-er looking to switch
p27
aVI recommend getting a capable mod instead of a "starter".  Starters tend to have low wattage and non-replaceable batteries with low capacity.  Even if you don't use all the capabilities today, you might eventually.\u000a\u000aYou are immensely spoiled by the size of the Juul.  I can't think of another device that comes close to its size.  Are you looking for a cigalike shape like the ego/evod or are you willing to try a box mod?
p28
aVDefinitely willing to try a box mod. And yeah I totally get that there is nothing that even remotely rivals the size of the Juul. That's fine, I can live with something bigger for sure. Any pointers on a decent box mod?
p29
aVNot to detract all all from /u/TheBlackDred below - he has great suggestions that have definite benefits in the size department with the way the tanks are subsumed into the form factor of the mod.\u000a\u000aMy favorite is the Smok Alien.  It's a dual-cell 18650 mod, has really nice firmware, and gives you the flexibility to explore whichever style of vaping interests you since it has variable wattage and temperature control modes with a maximum 250W.  These features describe a lot of mods in its price range, but I'm very impressed with the build quality of the Alien.  I really like that the Alien has a bar to press to turn on the coil instead of a button.  It feels very comfortable.  It also has an OLED screen with all the pertinent information on it simultaneously.  I really like that.\u000a\u000aThe Alien with a tank and two batteries weighs about the same as 500 Juuls. J/K.  You're spoiled there, too.  My combo weighs about 282g.  Juul weighs 15g. :)\u000a\u000aMy strongest advice, far above any brand or model, is to make sure you aren't wasting money on a purchase that you might outgrow too quickly.
p30
aVIcare or Icare mini are nice if you want something similar to juul
p31
aVJuul.
p32
aVI know the thing is great but floods immediately. I just want something that doesnt suck to get my GF off of cigarettes but all the cheap shit is adding up... kanger subvod, leaks like a bastard. Ego aio box, burnt hits immediately. iCare mini, might as well stick a straw in the bottle and call it a day. Oh except that wouldn't burn your mouth and lips, so that would actually be better. \u000a\u000aThere is the juul but pods get expensive quick, and weve already wasted 30, plus 30, plus 30 dollars (plus money for coils and juice each time...) on shit that sucks ass yet gets fine reviews. Then you actually read up and everyone that gets one has the same issue. Damn shill reviewers... and random "lucky" people that somehow have never had a kanger product leak or a teeny tiny coil fail to wick max VG juice... do you just live in burnthitsville and not notice? Or is quality control just so bad that all of these devices are in fact perfect, when you happen to get one out of ten that meets all the tolerances?
p33
aVI've had some luck refilling an older family member's juul pods - youtube has several walkthroughs.
p34
aV1. Love them. Have two. \u000a2. My most expensive mod is probably $60 or so. Nothing crazy. \u000a3. https://i.imgur.com/sIONPdD.jpg\u000a4. Amalfi, Bigglesworth Labs. 12mg, 50/50. It\u2019s the best. \u000a\u000a****\u000aEDIT: I think I misunderstood #2. So far this year I\u2019ve spent $1,500 or so. That\u2019s including all the mods, several dozen flavor concentrates, a scale, coil jigs, wire, cotton, batteries, charger, coils, magnetic mixer, more mods, JUUL pods, atomizer stand, PG, VG, more VG, syringes, pipettes, flasks, beakers, funnels, RDAs, RTAs, subohm tanks, a shelf to hold this shit, battery cases, little straps to keep the wire spools from unspooling\u2026 oh, and juice. You get the idea. 
p35
aV1: the juul is alright, but there are better basic devices out there at this point. The icare and the myjet are better in my opinion. \u000a\u000a2: I have no idea how much I've spent on mods/upgrades and I don't really wanna know as I've got a decent collection of some mid range ($100-150) to high end ($150+) mods and I really don't want to calculate what I've spent haha. \u000a\u000a3: not sure I have any pics but my prized possession in vaping is my provari P3 and my kayfun v4. It just works and it's my go to set up. Edit: just took a pic of it [here](https://imgur.com/a/S37Is) \u000a\u000a4: favorite juice? Probably gambit by five pawns or indigoRY4. 
p36
aV"A shelf to hold all this shit" ahahaha.\u000a\u000aIf you don't mind me asking, why do you have two Juuls?
p37
aVStandard \u201cTwo is one and one is none\u201d philosophy. \u000a\u000aI initially had just the one. I went on a camping trip and forgot to bring my charger along. It died on me and I had to make do with a Vuse for the rest of the weekend. It sucked. As soon as I got back home, I was going to get another charger ($10), then realized that for $40 more, I could get a backup Juul and another four pods. So that\u2019s what I did. 
p38
aV1) I like them for stealth vaping, but if I wanted something like a juul I'd get an eleaf iCare.\u000a\u000a2) ummm probably 2-3k in the last 6 months.\u000a\u000a3)I'm still trying to get my hands on a tiffany blue tugboat box mod....\u000a\u000a4) RKOI by coilspill. It's a strawberry champagne flavor or recently I've really been digging lava flow by naked
p39
aVI'd say go for a juul
p40
aV+1 for Juul. 
p41
aVjuul
p42
aVIf lightness and portability are your preference, I'd say nothing comes close to the Juul. The thing is so small it can fit in your wallet. The pull is very akin to a cigarette and you'll get your nic fix in a couple of hits. I'm pretty sure it's around $50 for a starter kit that comes with the device, charger, and 4 pods. 
p43
aVI\u2019ve successfully snuck in my JUUL a couple of times. Just jammed it in my shoe. I can\u2019t remember if I walked through a metal detector or not, though. \u000a\u000a/u/Onitsuj\u2019s solution is way more foolproof. You\u2019re already putting your keys in the bowl when you walk through the detector, so it won\u2019t trigger that. 
p44
aVDIY Juul Charger??! LOL
p45
aVr/juul loves this kind of stuff
p46
aVWhat's up guys, new here! Still trying to familiarize myself with Reddit.\u000a\u000aFinally made the switch from a box mod/tank set up to a closed system device.\u000a\u000aAnd holy shit... The JUUL is fucking great! I've been vaping since 2013 and this device is pretty damn awesome. My biggest gripe would be expensive pods. Although, I do enjoy the nicotine delivery. Gets me pretty light headed and gets me to vape less... for now. Any other Juul users in here and do you guys have any alternatives to refilling? 
p47
aVI don't use my juul any more but I must say it is super satisfying to hit. It is possible to refill the pods if you find they are getting to expensive
p48
aVHow come you don't use it anymore? I started messing with it and tried refilling it with some old 18mg that i had laying around. Definitely not as satisfying as the JUUL pods but i've been hearing some good things about Mr. Salt-E on the facebook groups. Gonna give that try when it comes in. 
p49
aVhey man I'm realy thinking about getting a Icare mini. Can you compare this to the juul in any way. how it hits and such
p50
aVI have not tried the Juul. I know it's fairly popular tho. \u000a\u000aAll I can tell you about is the icare mini. The Mini has a pretty tight air flow, like sucking a milkshake through a straw. You need to use higher nic unless you're going to take a lot of hits because you aren't getting as much vapor per hit. Flavor is fine, not amazing but it's good. Not much cloud obviously but you'd be surprised. \u000a\u000aCoils last a decent amount of time and the base recharges it fast, you can use it with the base attached as well or direct charge to the actual mod. \u000a\u000aThey're cheap so maybe pick both up.
p51
aVJust talked to guy who has a Juul. Says they are way better than the Mini. \u000a\u000aSays it has 50 nic but almost no hit, and after about three hits he's done. \u000a \u000aUses cartridges and is rechargeable.
p52
aVThis. Or all in one/pod systems like the iCare, Juul, or MyJet. Any simple system that are like cigarettes. For the MyJet or iCare, just make sure you get him some 18mg, especially if he was a consistent smoker.\u000aEdit: The Juul also has a really nice menthol flavor, and with that he wouldn't even have to buy juice, they just come in pod packs that he snaps in when one runs dry.\u000aEdit 2: [I have a post from earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/5ewry0/looking_for_a_setup_for_my_mom/?st=IVZH392W&amp;sh=f242cc31), and it was about an individual looking for a setup for his mom, you can see what others are recommending.\u000a
p53
aVJuul also has a really good throat hit and is very close to cigs i feel.
p54
aVThank you I'll check the Juul out!
p55
aVI would say check out the eleaf icare or the juul
p56
aVi would suggest a device like the Juul, or try getting a MTL atomizer and run lower wattage/higher nic to get that feeling. 
p57
aVI split my time among four devices:\u000a\u000a* __eGo AIO:__ 27ish watts on a 0.6\u03a9 coil\u000a* __eVic VTC Mini:__ 60\u201375 watts on a Crown 0.25\u03a9 or Griffin 0.55\u03a9 build\u000a* __Noisy Cricket:__ 110 watts on a 0.56\u03a9 build\u000a* __Pax JUUL:__ Huh? How the hell do I know?\u000a
p58
aVJust wait once you get a juul pen they hit at 54mg now that's fun. 
p59
aVEleaf Icare \u000aA nice step up from the juul
p60
aVVery nice. Does the iCare have a button? Or is it like a Juul? 
p61
aVIt's like the juul. Just draw and it'll hit. I just really like the fact that you can use any juice with it. 
p62
aVGreat choice, also the myjet is a lot like the juul but better.
p63
aVIt's not bad. The flavors not as good as the juul but you still get a pretty good taste out of it. 
p64
aVCheck out the juul, you can get it from most gas station where I'm from which is US
p65
aVTry picking up a juul or just a high nic tight mouth to lung set up. Thats what i do. Still don't do it in bars and the like but it helps alot when you can take a few puffs at 15mg or so and be good without blowing out a couple mls in an rda
p66
aVI'm totally into the mini vape trend.  I just got a myjet and a JUUL for my recent trip to Florida and was pretty happy.  I would like to try one of these icares out too.\u000a\u000aI really wanna get some mr saltz nicotine salts juice for the myjet
p67
aVI'm torn between this and the juul :/ 
p68
aVI've tried both, I reccomend this over the JUUL but honestly both are very similar. I believe the battery on this is slightly larger too.
p69
aVget an icare or a juul those are the closest things to cigarets and most importantly hassle free... \u000a\u000aa smoker set in his way who is not really interested in vaping won´t like having to maintain his vape gear and educate himself on the subject, if he gets into it by using the icare, than a upgrade later on is much more viable.\u000a\u000a\u000aalso why can´t the eleafe icare or the juul be used non stop in your opinion? \u000a\u000ahe won´t chainvape it... he is a smoker and he will use it like a cigarette... thats not chainvaping... and being a cigarette substitute is excatly what those were designed for.\u000a\u000aa pack a day is not so much that those devices couldn´t handle it...\u000a\u000aif you can afford to get a juul and buying the pods, which is a little bit \u000amore expensive than buing juice for the eleaf icare, go for the juul their juice uses nicotine salts and the effect is closer to a cigarette than other devices. It should still be cheaper than a pack a day.\u000a\u000a\u000aEdit: to be more specific on the pricing, one juul pod equals around one pack of cigarets and costs 4$ from the manufacturer... you can probably get them cheaper somewhere else online...
p70
aVGreat idea, would recommend!\u000a\u000a\u000aEspecially with you yourself not vaping going with the smok tfv8 you can easily get new coils and are good to go.\u000a\u000a\u000aFor two total novices I would advise against an rta like the petri which was suggested above...\u000a\u000aBTW. If this is supposed to be an incentive to Stopp smoking, be aware that could also backfire the setups suggested here are great imho if someone is interested in vaping already. If not, I personally would her rather give a Juul or a eleafe icare and a nice other gift, which are both way more hassle free and cater more to a smoker wanting to quit imho.
p71
aVPax juul for efficient vaping?
p72
aVPods are relatively expensive, but they're easy to refill if you DIY or find a vendor who sells eliquid that's compatible (relatively thin, high nic). Most Pod refill eliquids won't use Nicotine Salts but I'm not entirely sold on that being what's so special about JuuL nic anyways. [There's a decent theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deeper_DIY/comments/3k6h2r/nicotine_freebase_vs_salt_absorption_vaporization/) that its the benzoic acid that makes Juul nic so special. \u000a\u000aI use a Juul myself on the occasion when a full APV kit isn't desirable (wearing a suit, formal occasions, hiking, quick errand trip, etc). I've found I get about a day's use out of a full battery and 1-2 days per pod, mostly with 30mg/ml refill eliquid. 
p73
aVJuul
p74
aVI love gooold. Anyways, the Juul uses nicotine salts from which I read it allows more nicotine absorption. The pods are really easy to refill. A simple YouTube search should explain it. But the cool thing is I found a liquid company that makes their juice with nicotine salts. [MrSaltE](https://gaslightvapor.com/collections/e-liquids/mr-salt-e-liquids) 
p75
aVThe Myjet is also a great little device. Similar to the juul but with refillable "pods"  with built in coils. Definitely check it out. 
p76
aVYou could look into the juul ecig. I have a buddy who loves his. I believe most ampms have them, and there's a review on YouTube by Riptrippers that breaks down what it is and how it works. It's one of his most recent videos too\u000a\u000aEdit: FYI, the juul is a super slim little device that activates automatically when you take a pull, so no button pressing, and the draw/airflow is supposed to be very close to that of a cig. It comes with a variety of flavors including a tobacco flavor, and it's very plug and play style, as all of the juice is contained in a little cartridge that you just insert into the device. Nicotine level is much stronger than any other ecig I've heard of too. 
p77
aVWell if you're not too picky on flavour and just need something to kick the habit you can try the Juul. It's VERY compact, chargers via usb and has 4 different liquid pods containing like 5% of nicotine. \u000a\u000aDoesn't get simpler than inhaling when you want nicotine. Just remember to charge and change the liquid pods when empty.
p78
aVEven a cheap vape not from the gas station (istick pico comes to mind) will be far better quality, perform better, last longer and give you an overall better experience. \u000a\u000aI've known a few people who use the vuse, juul, or other disposables and go back to smoking because they are unreliable and not cheap in the long run.\u000a\u000aAll my opinion but a cheap tank and mod (istick Pico, joytech aio, etc..) will give you a better chance at quiting or be less off putting to a future hobbyist. 
p79
aVJuul is alright for a temporary replacement, say you're outta juice or cracked your tank or just waiting for a new mod. Just need that quick hit or something. 
p80
aVGet a juul
p81
aVFor those people recommend the juul, I tried to quit multiple times with blu and it never worked... the second I picked up a Juul (Jan 23, 2016) I was stinky free, and haven't had one since!  Even though I have a pico w/ a baby beast now, the juul still goes with me everywhere.
p82
aVHere's how I kicked the habit; I bought the Juul, I put it on the charger when I had 2 stinkys left in my pack, I smoked the stinkys, and threw the pack away while the Juul charged, I switched to the juul and never picked up another cig!  I then graduated to legit vaping with an istick pico and a tfv8 baby beast, but I still hit that Juul though because it's the closest feeling to smoking a cig that I've found.  Good luck!
p83
aVAlso 2 [JUUL](https://www.juulvapor.com) ecigs 
p84
aVDepends in what you have the airflow set at. I use 12mg in this bad boy as a way of saving money. I think it's a better deal than the juul  because you don't have to buy the pods, and it comes with a pretty sweet extended battery thing. I wanna get some 12mg menthol juice and this thing will be off the hook. It's actually like enough to hold with your lips. 
p85
aVThe juul by ploom. 
p86
aVJuul
p87
aVGuess it's not a popular opinion but I'd check out the Juul, if I was quitting now that's what I'd go with. Small, low maintenance, fairly available replacement pods, high nicotine, etc.
p88
aVI quit over a year ago and I want a juul real bad. It's just kind of pricey.
p89
aVThe reason I ask OP is because if you could manage, wire is pretty inexpensive, you could get 50ft of 22g kanthal from lightning vapes for something like 8$ or less. And organic cotton balls at a store that would last you months for like 5$. Honestly I would look into the gas station cig alikes. A juul or a vuse 
p90
aVThese are called the JUUL and are made by a company called Ploom(you might know their juices). You replace the cartridges on top to refill then rather than buying juice in a bottle. They're activated when you pull air through. 
p91
aVReally satisfying throat hit gets me buzzed in 2 pulls, 59mg tends to do that its good for out in public.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBut the wismec myjet is like an open tank system juul
p92
aVJust a small correction,\u000aJuul is owned by Pax Labs. They used to be called Ploom but some of the products were bought by a Japanese tobacco company and they created a new company.\u000aPloom currently has ties to big tobacco while Pax Labs are the kings of herbal vaporizers (and now closed system e cigs imo)
p93
aVLook into an ego AIO, endura t18/t22, or even a device like a juul or cync.  The first two are dead simple devices that have been on the market awhile and don't need anything other than a charge.  The juul and cync are closed systems that you can pick up until your symptoms subside, and due to their higher nicotine content, they may even work faster.  \u000a\u000aThe other route you could go is CBD oil, but that's not for everyone.
p94
aVI personally would not suggest those. They don't have nic or throat hit. There's a new little gadget that came out recently called juul. You should check that out.
p95
aVDon't use a Juul...   it's big tobacco trying to get into the vape business..  and junk...   A lot of newer vapers make the mistake of jumping into sub ohm setups out the gate for those big clouds and flavor.  if it is making you cough, why not try a smaller tank.  like the old school aspire nautilus.. at low wattage it's output is less, but alot better for new vapers.  also what nic juice are you using? 
p96
aVMy little project, a brushed steel Juul
p97
aVIf you take the battery out and torch the juul it will turn into a rose gold color
p98
aVHaving it gold plated would be awesome. But yeah I haven't actually torched my juul but a few people I know have. One didn't take his battery out and it didn't end well
p99
aVYeah thanks, I have a lavabox with a phenotype RDA and used to hate vapes like the Juul, but once I tried it I had to get one. They're just so easy to carry with you everywhere.
p100
aVIt's definitely more of a cig than a vape, that's why I stick to my Lavabox for clouds and flavor and the Juul for nic
p101
aVHow's the airflow on the juul? I'm was thinking about picking one up for my Gma, but she needs something that's mtl.
p102
aVMaybe look into something like the JUUl, i've heard thats amazing for people who just wanna get that buzz and tight draw feel
p103
aVLook into the Juul
p104
aVThe juul is great and discreet, as well as the Von Erl. If you're looking for a more complex vape I second the Joytech AIO or D22 if you want more battery power. 
p105
aVGet a Juul, it's crazy small, and you can use it as a backup when your batteries fail... Or just buy more batteries.  But the juul works great, closest thing to smoking a cig that I've ever found.
p106
aVThe juul isn't really a "setup" it's more like an add-along, or a side dish, that little something extra for times when you can't be "loud"
p107
aVI enjoy a hot vape. Try going up to 6mg and maybe it won't kill the flavor too much. I've also been interested in the juul for more of a nicotine quick fix. It has the same amount of Nic as a pack of cigs per pod.  Might be something worth trying!

aVGlad my boyfriend doesn't mind vaping, he'd rather me vape than smoke. \u000a\u000aBut seriously if she's acting like a child when you talk about it then you really need to have a serious talk about it, if you can. That's being too controlling over a dumb situation that doesn't affect her that much. \u000a\u000aYou could try not vaping around her so it doesn't cause tension or maybe get a JUUL or something similar to get your nic fix, but you won't be blowing clouds and stuff. 
p111
aVI'd say the AIO or even a juul, if you want a pen mod, i think the subbox mini is the same as the nano, and the nano is the lightest mod i own, there is smaller mods, like the eLeaf Pico, but not necessarily lighter.
p112
aVquestions on the juuls
p113
aVI'm about a 3mg user with my rda's, 6mg in tanks.  Purchased the JUUL for stealth vaping on the go.  Found that in moderation the JUUL is a good supplement, just don't hit it too often.  At my local B&amp;M the employees puff on their JUUL's constantly...I could see that increasing the nic requirement quite a bit.  As long as I stay off the analogs, I don't sweat it too much.
p114
aVThanks for the advice bro. I did that today at work I was hitting the juul when talking to customers but it still can't replace my smok tfv8 tank 
p115
aVIs Juul Worth it's Price?
p116
aVHoly wall of text :) (But I took the time)\u000a\u000aAnd I largely agree with every thing you wrote. I have two Juuls now, after having a "two is one and one is none" experience with it recently. I also have a dozen other mods, from a fleet of eGo AIOs to a few Noisy Crickets, Cool Fire TC100, VTC Mini, etc. RDAs and tanks and 1+\u03a9 mods.\u000a\u000aMy most-used devices are the AIOs for flavor and every day vaping, and the Juuls for when I'm having a beer or at a party. I'm only eight months from my smoking days, but drinking and socializing are still the events that make me miss smoking. And that's where the Juul really shines. Much more direct linkage between taking a hit and feeling the effects. Kills the cigarette craving cold.\u000a\u000aThe Bruule flavor is the only one I really like. Mint is ok. Tobacco and Fruit kinda suck in my opinion.\u000a\u000aCompared to the Vuse, Blu, etc, I think the Juuls are actually cheaper in the long run. The pods are about the same price, but I think they last longer than the cartridges for those other shitty cigalikes
p117
aVYes. I use the Juul out out of convenience. No huge rectangular bulge in my pocket anymore. I like the Vape. \u000a\u000aIf you check my post just history, I have compared it to the MyJet and Cync. I still use Juul on a daily basis. 
p118
aVAre there any similar products to the JUUL?
p119
aVGet a juul and you won't some another cigg. It is the best cig alike I ever tried. I'm 7 months without a cigg after 15 years of smoking. I have a lot of mods and tanks and don't even use them anymore. The juul is just like smoking a butt. 
p120
aV&gt; juul\u000a\u000aI've had at least 3 cigarette type vapes. None of them stuck. Very little options as far as flavor goes and the vapor production was always lackluster
p121
aVJuuls are actually very good. They hit nice and hard and the flavors are good for the most part
p122
aVSaw this on [Vaperazzi](https://www.instagram.com/p/BIq66iGBhsR/), apparently is just like juul but you can fill it with your own liquids.
p123
aVI vapes for 4 months and I got sick of it. I have tons of vape gear and juice and I stopped using it because it was like inhaling hot sugar and nothing else. I switched to the juul and havent picked up a vape since. The nic is satisfying and it is just like a cigg. 
p124
aVTrust me this thing is horrible the only good cigalike I've every used is the juul. 
p125
aVAgreed. I still use my juul, mostly for stealth. I just can't figure out why these big tobacco companies can't make a good vape device with all their money.
p126
aVI have my big mods that I use but I still keep a juul. It's nice for when I'm out in public and don't wanna be blowing huge clouds. Most of the juul flavors are pretty good too
p127
aVjuul
p128
aVI actually have a cubis tank for myself, and i got to be honest, im not really enjoying it so far and thinking of returning it, maybe i just got a bad one.\u000a\u000aJust checked out the VTC, theres a new one that can swap between 1/2 \u000ahttp://www.joyetech.com/category/evic-vtc/\u000aI might show her that and see what she thinks, \u000a\u000aThe mini vault and nugget look good, but will need her opinion, it might be too small length wise, but honestly i dont know, she can be pretty fussy lol\u000a\u000aregarding the von erl, that looks ideal , but i also showed her the juul as someone else suggested, and she wasn't keen on the idea of not being able to use her current ejuice ( which to be honest, is pretty annoying to myself &amp; my brothers as its the most basic menthol you could imagine... ) \u000a\u000aty for taking the time to provide me with a range of suggestions, im over hers today for dinner so ill try throw them all by her :)
p129
aVMaybe let her try yours and see what she thinks about that style.\u000a\u000aSometimes those quitting don't want big clouds, and want the restrictiveness of a cigarette. Other options would be a joyetech auto or an endurance t18.\u000a\u000aThe wismec myjet also just came out. Kind of like a juul with refillable pods. There are tons if good starter kits to quit smoking without jumping head first into the rabbit hole 
p130
aVWas it a [JUUL](https://www.juulvapor.com/), maybe?
p131
aV/u/stomper38's got you covered on the how-to-buy part. I just want to take a moment and shill for this device. It blows Blu and Vuse completely out of the water. \u000a\u000aI took mine on a camping trip and forgot to bring the charger. Learned the 2-is-1 and 1-is-none lesson again. Now I have two Juuls (and two chargers). \u000a\u000aIf you have the option to buy it at a gas station, do that over buying it online. It should be the same price and you don't have to be at home to sign for the package. 
p132
aVYeah. That's why I don't understand the comment. I guess OP thought Blu would be trying to use proprietary ingredients that the rest of the industry doesn't use?\u000a\u000aJUUL's e-liquid is something else, though. I have yet to find a comparable juice that is as satisfying at such low power. 
p133
aVIs this the new cig a like that is competing with the Juul? 
p134
aVAll hail the mighty juul!
p135
aVYes. I have the Juul as well. I like the Juul but I can never find pods in my area.  
p136
aVYeah, I've tried the Juul and I did like it, though people are always looking for those pods. 
p137
aVThere's a place off of Jones in Cypress that carry Juul pods, next door to a scrapbook store. Sorry, don't remember the name.
p138
aVI'd go with the AIO cheap and effective. The Juul you cant use your own juice.\u000aEdit - Fucking AUTO CORRECT
p139
aVMods: Grip taped Dimitri, H-priv 220 TV, RX200, Lotus mafia, and Juul\u000a\u000aAttys: MutationX V3, Moonshot, Freakshow, and Royal Hunter, respectively
p140
aVThe Pax Juul might fit the bill. Super discreet and relatively inexpensive. You'll do a spittake at the $/ml of the pods but each pod tends to last 1-2 days so I've found it to be either as expensive or cheaper than most vaping setups. \u000a\u000aThere's tutorials online of how to refill the pods too, which will get you 3-4 extra uses out of each one if you can find a company that does high-pg, high-nic (36+mg/ml) eliquid that you enjoy. 
p141
aVBe careful of heat build up charging inside your purse though, extra heat in enclosed space is not so good.\u000a\u000aTake a look at a product called "Juul".\u000a\u000aIt's not a cloud machine, it's a nicotine delivery system in cigalike form, very small. Quite effective from what just about every user has said that I have read, a few here at ECR have them.\u000a\u000aCould use a back up, or itself an Subvod as back up, if you are just looking to quit smoking that is. If you want clouds, stay the course you are on.\u000a\u000aHope that makes sense an helps.\u000a\u000a
p142
aVSome mtl like the nautilus mini or juul?
p143
aVJust get a juul. Most of those type pens especially knock offs are cheaply made. To me it's worth spending money for peace of mind. Another good actually pen is the x2o pro v vape. It's around 25$ has good flavor and low variable voltage.
p144
aVThe juul is a great device, I can't recommend it enough as a simple stealth vape for beginners and anyone who doesn't feel like getting into the advanced stuff... 
p145
aVI bought a juul a couple days ago...
p146
aVThe juul is a great device for its class. I was using it for a bit till I found sub ohm vaping.it was good then but now I'm used to getting a lot more vapor and flavor. Still makes a pretty good stealth mod though. I found a way to refill those little cartridges and put premium ejuice in. Works pretty good.
p147
aVThe JUUL is an awesome little device. Just be careful, the pods that they say have a VERY high nic level. You can refill the cartridges pretty easily to save money, but then you don't get the "nicotine salts" that the pods offer. The JUUL is definitely the closest experience to an actual cigarette I have found. With the refilled pods it wasn't quite as enjoyable. 
p148
aVBeen using the Juul for a while and finally made the switch! So... handcheck!
p149
aVTake a look at the juul. Buy the kit and you don't need anything else to start.
p150
aVwhatever you do, don't get a mech/stick/pen vape for varying reasons... mech - too complicated to start with, stick/pen - likely wont cut it.  Get a box mod, get one with TC/VW, with replaceable batteries.  \u000a\u000aI started with a VTC-VT kit, and now would recommend anyone to start by buying a mod an tank seperate.  If you have a physical shop ask them what they have.  I say this cause it would have saved me about $40 (Im in Aus so pricing is ridiculous here) if I didn't get the kit.\u000a\u000a(I don't know about the JUUL their kit tank may be far better than the eGo mega)

p153
aVTrying to find aN online retailer of Juul Pods that doesn't require a 21+ signature.
p154
aV... additionally, you might want to look into the Juul (Google is your friend), as it might be a good transitional device from cigarettes. 
p155
aVI've had alot of friends switch from 100$ mods to the juul. I'd highly recommend it. 
p156
aVRecenlty bought JUUL for my grandmother
p157
aVYou did a good thing!  If she likes the juul enough to not smoke, that's great.  Maybe sometime she would like to try something like the AIO so she can have more choices of flavors, nicotine level, save a few bucks in the long run.  From what I understand, the juul is very high in nicotine, and on the expensive side.  But it's not like your grandma needs to blowing huge clouds.  Unless she wants to!
p158
aVImo a juul is a great device. Only problem I had with it was it was just too much nic for me
p159
aVAnything is better than a cigarette, my friend!\u000a\u000aIt's true there are better devices than the JUUL but they come with a price and require research. You've done a great thing. If she keeps it up do the research and spend on a much better device.\u000a\u000aThe JUUL will do for now. :)
p160
aVHave you considered a Juul? I use it when I'm doing load in/out days and it suit me just fine. Super stealthy and hits nice! 
p161
aVJust picked up the JUUL and so far it's been great!
p162
aVJuul. [See this thread](/r/Vaping/comments/4qtpc7/today_marks_one_month_without_a_cig_all_thanks_to/) for more info. 
p163
aVI cannot recommend the Juul enough! I have been of cogs for a month with it! Super cheap, super reliable
p164
aVIt's called the JUUL. Each cartridge is the equivalent of 2 packs of cigarettes.
p165
aVThis is the JUUL. I love the simplicity of this device. Each cartridge is the equivalent of 2 packs of cigarettes.\u000a\u000aI bought one for myself and one for my best friend. I vaped for awhile before and had a few mods.\u000a\u000aThese mods (sigelei 150 and tfv4) pushed her away. She had no interest in the vapor production. She just wanted to quit, as did I.\u000a\u000aWhen I stumbled upon the Juul, it was an answer to prayer. \u000a\u000aThanks to that after 7+ years of smoking, she is 2 weeks without a single cigarette!! \u000a\u000aI am so thankful for this little guy!
p166
aVYou say that, but Juul groups are chock full of juice and mod makers who have been in the game for 3+ years.\u000a\u000aIf the goal is a nic fix with the least possible amount of fuss, nothing really comes close to the Juul.
p167
aVCongrats! Hitting a juul is so satisfying but I got rid of mine for a bigger device. The pods are a bit expensive and I wanted to lower my nic intake and unfortunately they don't make pods with less nic
p168
aVHmmm, you're making me think I should buy my dad a Juul. He has a VTC Mini and a Vengeance tank, and he hasn't touched it in months, so he's back on the stinkys.
p169
aVlove my juul. had it for almost a year now and it's still going strong
p170
aVI definitely feel the Juul is a better quitting device for avid cigarette smokers than a typical vape mod. Especially since you can hold it like a cig and has a much much sharper hit than a box mod etc. I love taking it to the bars when I don't feel like lugging around a box mod or have everyone wanting to "chuck some clouds bruh" with my mod. 
p171
aVThese things rock, we just got them in our shop recently and a lot of older people don't want anything big or complicated and we've only had pen styles that they had to refill and buy new coils for. We have a lot of trouble with older customers they hate doing all that but we've only had what we had. Until the Juul and all its beauty, we personally tried them being people that use mods and drippers and were amazed. Simple, small, packs the punch you need and you can still buy premium liquid to refill cartridges if that doesn't bother you or just buy refills. Definitely recommend these to anyone trying to quit smoking but don't want anything crazy. 
p172
aVI used a juul too till I found out about sub ohm vapes and what not. Damn thing is the best of its class. BTW you can refill the cartridges with whatever ejuice Ya got. I put some 80/20 in it and it vaped great just killed the coil sooner though.
p173
aVCongrats. I've spent a ton of money on mods and juices and coils. It's all a huge waste of money. Making big clouds gets old fast. The object is to quit. I dropped all that flashy stuff and went back to Blu. They are much more like a cigarette than the cloud makers. I did try Juul as well. And I did like them. My only issue with them was the short battery life. Puffing on a Blu Pina Colada right now. again, congrats to you both. 
p174
aVHell yeah. This thing is awesome. For reference purposes, I have every type of device and atomizer you can think of. A couple mechs, VTC mini, Cuboid, CF4TC100, 2 AIOs, a T18, a T22, Subvod. Several RDAs, both Griffins, a Subtank Mini, Joyetech's shitty eGo One Mega tank, a Crown, an Arctic V8, the iSub tank. \u000a\u000aMy daily driver is the AIO, but the Juul is perfect for taking with me when I go out with friends. I recently used one after a 10-hour flight. It hit me like a freight train, just like a cigarette would have back in the day. \u000a\u000aHave you tried waving it around after taking a drag? Look at the LED when you do. 
p175
aVJuuls are awesome especially if you're into the whole every day carry scene.
p176
aVWhat are your thoughts on the Juul? Pros and cons.
p177
aVPros - Sexy stealth package that will never feel like a burden in your pocket or in a strangers face on the street; best throat hit for an e-cig alike (and only cigalike I've ever tolerated let alone incorporated so heavily into my routine). Passable flavors (20+ better ones were tested, but not released yet if ever according to their mum "outreach" team members I've talked to. This might turn into a dealbreaker for me as if I am stuck with this shit tobacco or crem brulee as my only options at 5% nic I might not be using it as much soon. The flavor fatigue on these first four flavors is very real). Extremely potent nic delivery that rivals the spike you get from a real cig [like so](https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/pax-evaluation.png), probably because of the "nic salts" instead of freebase (normal ecig juice) and benzoic acid make this even better for being discrete and not needing too much clouds/puffs to get yer fix.\u000a\u000aCons - Only one nic strength that may be too much for some (they had a spectrum of different nic strengths available for test and when they were out they left a gaping hole in my preferences). Some pods leak (though customer service is great and will replace them). If you don't want MTL vapes, this isn't for you. Some people claim pods are refillable, but this is a dubious claim at best as the atomizer craps out after a few uses anyways and any juice you put in there is not going to match the experience of JUUL juice (which is half the battle for this device for me honestly), while also probably leaking. Last con is the company has been fairly tight-lipped about any plans for their future or test results of options people have been requesting. They'll just point you to a newsletter that has probably gone out once in the 2016 calendar year asking if my dad smokes. Signing up for it will net you a 25% discount on their site, though (not insignificant, especially since its the cheapest place to buy pods that I know about). \u000a\u000aFor such a game-changing device for me personally I just wish they'd up the engagement level a bit. No point in having social media accounts if they are just to facilitate mint restocks.\u000a\u000a
p178
aVJUUL
p179
aV/r/vaporents or /r/waxpen, I don't think any of these do e-liquid.  If they come out with a new Juul though I'd be interested.
p180
aVI talked with a pax rep a while back, apparently they're going to try to come out with juul brand e-liquid. I'm not sure how they're going about it now with the ban and all but he said that the market was growing and they, "really want a piece of that action," his words. The then gave me a free juul and a free shirt. This was back when I worked in a smoke shop.
p181
aVI usually keep the dock in my car and plug it into the 12v, kinda looks like it was built into the dash. The battery does die a bit too soon though. Maybe if they released a new Juul with games like they have on the pax 2. With refillable carts.
p182
aVMy terrible experience with the JUUL by PAX
p183
aVIdk what to tell you I use mine everyday and have never had a single problem with leaking or anything.  I've had pods for local stores, juul and eBay and all have been fine. 
p184
aV42mg? Was he running a dripper/sub ohm tank or was it out of a lower power set up? IIRC the Juul is 50mg and really low power and most people I know cannot chain hits off it without getting messed up real quick. 
p185
aVThe mini volt is great for stuff like that Or get a juul. Love mine. 
p186
aVI've heard only good about juul, but it's MTL right?
p187
aVOn my desk at the moment are Cloupor Mini+/Kayfun Mini V3, Ego AIO, Juul, IPV D2/Griffin, Mini Volt/Nautilus X and Kilo Edition SnowWolf Mini/Serpent Mini
p188
aVJuul is the only cigalike I've ever found to be useful.
p189
aVI originally quit using Blu, almost went back to smoking but luckily went to a vape shop and got a better setup instead.  Blu aren't very good.  Juul is really good if you want a cig like experience but none of the other cigalikes are very good in my experience, might get you by for a while if you needed something really small though and Juul isn't available in your country since they're U.S. only right now.
p190
aVIf juul makes it out the gate I'll pretty pleased. 
p191
aVI have buuen using a Juul for a couple weeks. and sometimes in the morning when I use it, I get a traditional heavy nicotine rush. no ecig has ever done this for me. is it because of the different way they use the nicotine (salt vs. freebase) or the unusually high (5%) nix volume.
p192
aVI'd say it's because of the amount of nicotine. I used to have a juul and it's honestly really nice for a e cig but the pods are expensive ($17 where I live for a pack of 4) and it's too much nicotine imo 
p193
aVWhat do you think about the Juul?
p194
aVYou could check out the Juul, try starting out with that, it's a little over 50 mg/ml and definitely provides quite the nic hit, based on your habits it might be expensive though to go through a few of those pods a day but I guess probably not more expensive than 3 packs a day of smokes.  After you get off the cigs you could work your way down later but definitely get off 3 packs a day, I can't even imagine what that's doing to your body.
p195
aVSo a few days ago someone asked me to post the pocket mods I used because I described a few.  So here they all are for size comparison purposes.\u000a\u000aFrom Left to Right:\u000a\u000aGoblin Nano on COV Mini Volt\u000a\u000aJuul by Pax\u000a\u000aAspire Plato w/ Triton Mini 1.8 ohm clapton coils\u000a\u000aEgo AIO\u000a\u000aKayfun Mini V3 on Cloupor Mini +\u000a\u000aT-18 Prism Tank on Cloupor Mini 30w\u000a\u000aNautilus Mini on Tesla Two\u000a\u000aGriffin on IPV D2\u000a\u000a30 ML bottle for size reference.\u000a\u000aLately I've usually been carrying the Kayfun Mini V3 or the Griffin combo and the AIO in the other pocket.
p196
aVNoticed a juul there. I think it's the best cig like device.I've been putting 50/50 ejuice in the cartridge and it gives even more vapor.
p197
aVI do the same basically. I use the juul when I'm outside my work van and my mod when I'm in it. As for the pods I had same leak problem at first with high vg but when I changed to 50/50 didn't give me probs .don't know if you filled it the same way but I pull the black cap off then pull out the rubber stopper ,fill and put it all back on. Lasts a half week before I burn out the coil. :)
p198
aVLast cool rebuild ever:( tomorrow I will be a proud owner of the Juul.
p199
aVJuul works great for a quick nic fix, don't use that thing like you do your Subtank though, it's a TON of nic, 50mg/ml.  The cartridges also are only .75 ml so you can go through them quick without realizing it and they cost $4 a piece.  I use them for work when I'm going to be at customer sites and don't want to be pulling out a box mod but I'd imagine it would be quite expensive as a solo device.  It would be nice if you could refill them, I've tried but never found any juice they could take that wouldn't flood and leak like crazy.
p200
aVDon't quite understand how one could choose something like the Juul over a full-sized RTA or a normal tank... There are just so many limitations coming with the Juul.\u000aIf it's only for not needing to build no more coils, then why not a normal tank?
p201
aVHow is the juul much stronger? Just curious... Last I checked, couldn't you just build a higher ohm coil, go mouth to lung and raise your nic content?
p202
aVJust picked up this thing. It is called juul. Check it out, it's unreal.
p203
aVThe USB Charger on the Juul destroyed my hard-drive
p204
aVJuul seems pretty well regarded here as far as cigalikes go (I haven't tried it). https://www.juulvapor.com/\u000a\u000aStill, the best way to start is an eVic VTC Mini starter kit.
p205
aVThe juul I'm not sure if you would call is "disposable" but it is and your best bet for sure. 
p206
aVInnokin Endura T18.  It was designed around the idea to transfer smokers to vaping.  Not too much power.  Comfortable mouth to lung inhale (mimics smoking).  Easy to fill tank.  Very high quality vape for a "starter" setup.  Or the Juul if you want something smaller (almost like a very high quailty cigalike).
p207
aVthe pax juul IMO. very high on nicotine though
p208
aVNah just get a juul. They have like 50 nic, so no clouds just the buzz. That's what I use at work

aVYou're not really supposed to use salt nicotine e juice on a rda or other sub-ohm device. This is because usually too much power is running through it for high concentrations of nicotine and you need to be careful about overdoing it. Salt nicotine e juice are meant for devices like the sourin air, juno, juul, etc. You can find many of these devices in vape shops or online. The key difference between one of these devices and your rda is that the ohms (resistance) is much higher and the power is much power. This let's the device have a harder pull so it feels more similar to a cigarette. Useful for people trying to quit. I would not recommend using salt nicotine e juice on an rda, that just sounds like trouble if you ask me.

aVJuul's spontaneous popularity
p219
aVIdk when specifically but it sucks that so many youngins use it to get \u201cbuzzed.\u201d Although, it is better than smoking, so that\u2019s the only bright side. It was instrumental in getting me to quit. The product works for this purpose. (As much as I hate to say it, because JUul isn\u2019t very \u201cvape community\u201d friendly.) 
p220
aVYeah, definitely this, you can legit JUUL anywhere and get away with it.  The \u201cclouds\u201d almost dissipate instantly, and you get your nic fix quickly(Not condoning Vaping where you\u2019re not supposed to smoke, just stating that it can be done with this device).
p221
aVI'm a college student and a weed smoker. Some of my friends enjoy mixing weed and tobacco (chops, mokes, moles, spliffs, etc.) and want to stop using straight up T, so they bought Juuls to get their nic fix. They're easy to hide and use because of the pod system, but I prefer my mod. You can't control the strength of the nic which is a draw for some people because they're used to the strength of cigs, but a turnoff for me since I'm sensitive to nic and prefer 3mg juice. 
p222
aVWhat do you mean by this? I\u2019m a pack a day smoker and was looking into switching to the Juul. 
p223
aVI quit smoking instantly with the JUUL, it was so much better than this blu ecigs or any other cigalike that I tried, because I didn\u2019t really want to become a \u201cVaper\u201d with a huge mod and all that stuff... but then I tried an AIO device, then I got a nicer AIO device... then I got a pico, then and alien, then a Battlestar, then a mech, and attys galore... and more mods... but I haven\u2019t had a cigarette since the first time puffing on a juul.
p224
aVPicked up a Juul for the same reason. Stay strong man. 
p225
aVHey did you figure something out. ? I'm trying to mix it with trgulat strength juul nic salt.
p226
aVmay as well use it as an excuse to scope out a juul ¯\u005c\u005c_(\u30c4)_/¯ 
p227
aVI was told the Endura T20S is great for MTL vaping. But it is a vape pen, not a small box mod. Glad to know that the coil lasts. I will put it in my wish list and JUUL or Breeze delete. Yesterday someone says they do not provide much flavor. 
p228
aVLuggage being shipped to Singapore with Juul pods???
p229
aVModding then twelve Juno to use juul pods?
p230
aVGet a mini-MTL like the iCare, Breeze or Juul.\u000a\u000a\u000aYes you have to pay for coils or pre-filled pods, but a pack of coils is not that much more than a pack of smokes.\u000a\u000a\u000aLow initial investment and with iCsre or Breeze you can use regular juice.\u000a\u000a\u000aI started with an Envii Fitt and that got me through two weeks. Eventually the B&amp;M near work didn't have   pods so I bought a Breeze so I could refill juice and swap coils. After awhile of not smoking then you can get into the fancy stuff, but step one is one day with no cigarettes.
p231
aVTry the Juul
p232
aVGL, try the juul!
p233
aVTry looking into a juul or other salt based nicotine device. Because it's much higher in nicotine than a traditional cloud blowing vape it can give you that sharp buzz of nic that cigs give you. I smoked and vaped for a few years but I quit cigs in August with the help of my juul. Good luck buddy :)
p234
aVtry a juul
p235
aVIm a recent cigarette quitter. I started with the juul and eventually moved to a sub ohm. I find the regular juice far less satisfying than the juuls nic salt and big throat hit.  But most days I can get by on normal juice. \u000a\u000aAnyways i would get a juul and the tobbaco pods. Those really squash cig cravings for me. Give it a few days of just juul and no cigs and you should be able to quit without a huge struggle. 
p236
aVThanks for the help, I'll look into the juul. :)
p237
aVJuul Help...
p238
aVLook up how to clean juul battery. You can push the sled that holds everything out of the case by pushing down the top with a flathead screwdriver or something. From there clean it all up and put it back in. Make sure led is facing the right way. I have to do this every week or so with mine 
p239
aVHonestly I did, then I got a Juul and it helped curbing it until the nic in my vape juice took over 
p240
aVThe Juul uses a consolidated pod which has about the same amount of nic as a pack of cigarettes, it\u2019s much easier if you look it up 
p241
aVI agree, I recently got an xfire which is essentially a smaller and cheaper juul. It's been great, I can take it to work and stealthily hit it, get where I wanna be in just one or two hits, and then pocket it and be chill for an hour or two. Perfect for work or for taking around in public.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMy main mod now only gets used in my car or at home.

aVJuul device recall
p244
aVI've went through quite a few mtl devices like the breeze.\u000a\u000a\u000a-Limitless pulse is a great pod pen that is basically a long juul that is refillable.\u000a\u000a-Icare2 is a pretty good mtl that is a great upgrade to the 1 despite having iffy coils\u000a\u000a-Vaporesso Aurora is a nifty zippo like mtl that looks like a slightly bigger zippo lighter\u000a\u000a-Phix is kinda garbage and tried to live off the juul hype but due to overpriced pods and difficult refilling the prejuiced pods I can't recommend it\u000a\u000a-Suorin Air is my current mtl nic salt mod and I really like it. Basically a thicker credit card with auto pull but I have heard mixed reviews about the coils.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAll of these I can add more to but I'm on mobile and didn't want to type forever for no reason.
p245
aVIf I was to recommend anything to a starter you could either go the route of a All in one system (means the battery, tank, and mod is all one unit) such as a Aspire Breeze, juul, or suorin air. Buttttttt I would strongly suggest getting a Smoant Charon and a Crown III tank. You will need to buy batteries and a battery charger tho (which may not be the route you wish to take at this early of a stage)\u000a\u000aI would suggest going to YouTube and searching \u201cAIO vape mod\u201d and starting from there. YouTube is your best friend in this situation.\u000a\u000aElement vape \u000aVaporDNA \u000aThose are two very good sites\u000a
p246
aVNp. Head over to the sidebar of r/electronic_cigarette for more useful links. Most beginners are recommended with vape pens (all in ones) or pods (juul, suorin, etc) for starters. Try to avoid Smok products. Though some may have good experiences with them, a lot of threads with issues have been and still being posted. With their mass production comes with poor/unreliable quality. GL!
p247
aVGet a Juul man. The cartridges are disposable and you keep the same little stick without wasting batteries.
p248
aVA JUUL would be great for you, or any of the pod likes will be great. 
p249
aVI got a vape to stop juuling since it was so high in nicotine
p250
aVThe myjet or limitless pulse is very similar to the juul except you fill the pods with whatever juice you want. The myjet has a cool external battery pack that really boosts battery life. 
p251
aVYou can refill your Juul pods with 6 mg nic.
p252
aVSunset on the Red Sea, 1st vape handcheck. The girlfriend just bought me an upgrade for when I get home! The JUUL litterally stopped working after finishing the pod in the picture. Can\u2019t wait for the upgrade
p253
aVThen get a juul 
p254
aVJuul, penguin, or a Phix would be a good next step
p255
aVThere's also a similar product to the JUUL called the Phix. They both work pretty much the same and are about the same size, but with different designs and names.
p256
aVThe T Priv haha I should\u2019ve clarified. I\u2019ve had the Juul since about late September and it definitely helped me quit the habit, but I\u2019ve always wanted to get my hands on a nicer mod that I can actually tinker with a little bit and today was the day.
p257
aVIt is very heavy, I was shocked. But I am used to carrying the Juul around which is like a usb stick haha
p258
aVIt looks like a phix to me they are pretty comparable to a juul 
p259
aVHow do the bo pods taste in comparison to juuls?
p260
aVEvery Bo pod that ive had has been really gross, the cotton seems to burn instantly on all the pods and the flavors have a really bad feel to them. I just switched to juul a month ago and like it way better 
p261
aVFirst off, regardless of which approach to vaping you take, I hope you\u2019re successful in quitting! That being said, there\u2019s a lot of different products in the vape world. Regular vape juice is freebase nicotine, instead of nic salt-base like is in cigarettes, naturally occurs in dip, and the Juul. The Juul runs off pods that have a salt-based nic so it\u2019s supposedly closer to the sensation you get from the nic in cigarettes and dip. Might want to look into that a bit if regular juice doesn\u2019t work out the best for you. 
p262
aVNot sure if juul or wifi antenna in background.... 
p263
aVAspire breeze. Innokin t18 or t20. Juul. Boulder rock. 
p264
aVGo with the JUUL...best device out there today if you want to quit smoking...their pods are loaded with 50mg of nicotine in 0.7 ml of liquid!
p265
aVThe Juul and Suprin Air are both really good. I like the Suorin better because I think it\u2019s a lot cheaper and you can use your own juice. (Salt nic)
p266
aVIMO the juul feels less than 50mg for me. When I refill my pods with salt e (45 mg) I get a greater buzz.
p267
aVI dropped my juul in my e brake housing yesterday. That was a first. 
p268
aVif you are wanting something small I would say a phix which is really just a bigger version of the juul but I would say the best thing to do is just go into a local shop and look at some starter kits they have so u can actually look and hold them things like that and see if it is something that your brother would like. There area ton of starters out there now that dont cost a ton just the matter of finding the right one that is right for you. I am sure that there is someone that can help you more then I can. Still new to vaping but when I started I just went into a shop and sat down with someone there and they answered all my questions and really helped me out.
p269
aVTry the Juul. $40 for the pen. Strong pods (50mg of Nicotine) and they\u2019re pretty much fool proof.
p270
aVAnyone know of a vape that\u2019s its like the JUUL but with far less nicotine?
p271
aVYou can find stealthy vapes that use the regular 3mg-12mg juice. The icare mini is an example. It's a bit larger than the JUUL, but it's still very small. 
p272
aVI\u2019m a fucking fiend. I carry them in a bag with my batteries and tons of juice, which stays in the car. \u000a\u000aI\u2019ll select the appropriate vape for whatever situation arises. \u000a\u000aIf I\u2019m on campus, I\u2019ll take my aspire breeze (not pictured) for discretion. At work I\u2019ll take my 20700 devices as I\u2019m allowed to fog the place out however I please. If I\u2019m boolin at the club I\u2019ll take my G-Priv, set that bitch\u2019s lights on Rainbow Fade and destroy the masculinity of Juul users. \u000a\u000aWhen I\u2019m in the privacy of my own home, I do whatever I want; series boxes, my old Kanger Five6, etc.\u000a\u000aI have so many vapes. I have no idea what to do with this Wismec gen3. \u000a\u000aBut short answer, yeah, my guy. 
p273
aVThere are so many better and cheaper alternatives to a juul. If you\u2019re interested in pod system vaporizers with high levels of nicotene, check out the limitless pulse, aspire brez, or even the phix. And as for the juice, Mr salt eliquid is fairly cheap and it is salt based (also know as nicotene in its acidic form) from 25-45mg.  
p274
aVHell yeah man and it\u2019s my girl friends. I\u2019m more of a mod guy my self. But the juul is nice when I can chuck clouds 
p275
aVI will swear by the Juul for the foreseeable future as a device for someone to stop smoking.
p276
aVjuul is no better than disposables that were around in gas stations 5 years ago, incredibly unsatisfying, but if it works for you then that's all that matters.
p277
aVI think it works fine for getting right off cigarettes but I just can't imagine using it for a sustained period of time. Most people that I know that did use juul eventually went the way of stronger devices and either continue to use those or quit entirely. The pods are expensive, flavor is weak and limited options, and the hit is too throaty for me considering the high PG/VG ratio. 
p278
aVWell heres how the wife uses it. The juul covers her nic cravings due to the high nic content. For the hand to mouth she uses an obs engine with 3mg nic juice.\u000a\u000aThis helped her quit. Because a subohm tank was to much. The vapor made her cough, etc. Like it will anyone who is quitting. The juul is very close to a cig and packs a big dose of nic. Once she got to where vapor didnt make her cough, then she could back down the use of the juul and uses the sub ohm tank for most of the time. Only hitting the juul when nic craving get to be to much.\u000aIf her minikin/engine were lost busted, she would be chill until we replaced it.\u000aBut panic mode would ensue if something happened to her juul heh.\u000a\u000a
p279
aVHeating a juuls outer case
p280
aVI have a friend that moves juuls and pods, when I asked him about taking the outer case off, he said that it is much harder to do with newer juul designs. There are probably new youtube videos on how to do it, but its not as easy as it used to be.
p281
aVI remember where I worked people came in asking for either Naked juice or Juul pods a lot of the time. We didn't carry either.
p282
aVThe purple Minikin is awesome!! I love my setup with the OBS engine. The Juul is my baby though. I smoked for 30 years and tried to quit a million times and the Juul is what made it happen. 
p283
aVI'd recommend a juul, not my style personally , but it's compact, holds a long charge, and has a lot of different flavor options. But If you're looking for something with a bit more customization, then something like a smok stick. That way you could change out the juices, coils, etc .
p284
aVThanks for the suggestion. I\u2019ve talked to a few people in my area about the juul, looked fight up my alley, only problem is that they are having serious trouble getting the replacement parts? I (am new to this) can\u2019t remember what they are called but they look like filters for the eliquid, the guy I bought my breeze from said he hasn\u2019t been able to get that part for the juul in 3 months. Didn\u2019t want to risk it. \u000a\u000aIf you don\u2019t mind, tell me more about the smok stick? I don\u2019t need to be able to customize too much, im just gonna get the black and be done with it. Have you or someone you know used it? 
p285
aVA lot of my friends have been using juuls and they seem to work pretty well. I think if you can get him something that is nicotine salts it'll be perfect small, long lasting battery and a great mouth to lung hit if you need any more info you can pm me but you should definitely look into a juul or a juno it's what I've been trying to get my mom to use!
p286
aVEither a juul or a sourin air. The air is nice cause you put your own juice in it and aren't stuck paying way more for packs of pods. Me salt e has great juice for the device as well.
p287
aV\u000aDoes it use proprietary pods like the Juul? Or can you use your own eliquid?
p288
aVI\u2019m returning to the game after a 5 month juul switch. Question about staggered fused Clapton
p289
aVThe downvotes because your bassically hating on the improvement of technology then bashing it because its not the way you wanted it to improve. Not every vape now and days is a big 8lb hunk of pipe those would be called mech mods and theyve been around since the beginning. Not everbody wants a mod with controls and finnicky menu systems and they have options for those people now like the pod vapes or single button mods like the joyetech penguin or eleaf icare v2 or juuls. but some people like to have the option to make there vape hotter or cooler or use tempature control mode because thats what they enjoy and its what's helped them get off cigarettes. Not everybody wants a small device they can put in there shirt pocket and not everybody wants a big mod that will weigh there pants down but for those who do there are plenty of options weve came so far from where we were in previous years. If you want to use a 3.7v pen with an aspire mini nova tank then thats your choice and nobody is will hate on you because of it because vaping is a great alternative to smoking and has saved so many lives over the years and people arnt worried about how expensive or new your setup is along as your staying away from tobacco. \u000a\u000aNow to awnser the question you asked where can you get ye old pens? Well your in luck discountvapers.com has been around for longer than ive been vaping and the majority of devices they sell are 2013 or older. 
p290
aVNot everybody likes vaping at 15watts. I know I didn't when I first started vaping. I eventually went back to cigarettes. Only once I could vape at 80w+ was I satisfied with vaping. Vaping at higher wattage means more power is required, which means larger batteries, sometimes two or three of them.\u000a\u000a I would say most people on Reddit that vape have a device capable of 75w or more and maybe that's why you don't think that vaping has gone in the direction you prefer. But you're just plain wrong. \u000a\u000aNic salts are fairly new to the mainstream and allow those low watt devices to push a lot of nicotine at low power. Juul, sourin air, mi-one, sourin drop all take nic salts. And even if nicotine isn't your thing and that doesn't matter there are plenty of stealth mods that you could fit in the palm of your hand that aren't designed for nic salt.\u000a\u000aSo the reason you're getting downvoted is because you didn't bother to do any type of research before complaining.
p291
aVTry a Juul or juno pod system. Or a salt nic base. I use 30mg Solace in an Endura T20 and it let's you get your fix with like 3 rips instead of constantly ripping a box mod or something. It's mtl which is good for a new vaper. 
p292
aVit\u2019s pretty good, i use it for stealth and on the go and it\u2019s fairly effective. i like it more than the juul personally. 
p293
aVIf you're looking for something similar to a cigarette, the highest end you coukd go with is a Juul. They're an MTL hit, and give you your nicotine cravings. If you're going for more of a mod of somr sort I'd go with a Smok stick V8 (I know, they get a ton of shit, but my smok stick has lasted me years.) or another stick-lile kit. 
p294
aVYeah i\u2019m using a juul type thing called a juno and i quit smoking cigs. It\u2019s good they have menthol and tobacco flav juice pods

aVAMAZING JUUL HACK
p296
aVYou might also want to look into a juul
p297
aVYouTube is your best friend. But I agree with the post above me in recommending a juul. It\u2019s a great cig replacement 
p298
aVFor sure- I'm gonna see what I can find on there this weekend. Thanks! And I've heard the Juul is great, from several people- both on here and through friends. What makes it such a great cig replacement? 
p299
aVThe throat hit is damn near identical to a cig. I haven\u2019t smoked for 2 years but damn does the juul hit like a cig. Multiple friends of mine used them to quit
p300
aVGet a Juul they kick your nic cravings out of the window.
p301
aVI'd reccomend a Juul I could never do nic vapes before I tried it. Nic vapes always tasted like crap to me too.. just use a Juul for your nic fix and keep vaping 0mg on your mod(:
p302
aVIf you want to quit tobacco, try getting a phix or a Juul. Higher nicotine and has the same throat hit as a cigarette; it's definitely helped me a lot! 
p303
aVHalf the people i recommend this to. The other half i recommend getting rid of all their old stuff and getting a juul or something mi one. Some old smokers really arent into the whole building scene and just want something simple.
p304
aVFuck this building buying work more shit. If you're a habitual smoker you have to treat it as such - replace your smoke breaks with vape breaks. Dont just vape freely all day like most of us do. Now if u need a real nicotine kick just up the nic and keep it as a "smoke break"\u000a\u000a\u000aFind a setup that works for YOU. Do u like the idea of vaping as a habit? Look into rebuilding! Do you want the most basic, convenient cigalike? Try a juul! Do you want an in between with cool flavors? Your mod right now works!\u000a\u000a\u000aMain thing is, vaping can become a secondary source of excess nicotine if you dont treat it as a "replacement therapy" as it's meant to.

aVI only make these jokes because iCare. Juul understand what Im talking about soon enough.
p316
aVGood choice my dude! Looking into nic salts lately, should I go with this or the juul?
p317
aVI've tried both the Juul and the Breeze. I really like both but the Breeze is very convenient as you can buy normal juice bottle for refills. The juul uses proprietary juice pods. Whatever you choose will be a good choice ;) 
p318
aVGood non-Propylene Glycol juices for Juul?
p319
aVGot good and bad news for you. \u000a\u000aGood first: You can get 100% VG juices! You just may have to DIY. If you can stomach just a little PG, tons of online juice sellers carry \u2018max VG\u2019 options which is generally 80-90% VG. \u000a\u000aBad news second: It\u2019s not gonna work in your Juul. The reason the Juul and other MTL devices use PG is it has a very low viscosity, and wicks easily. Max VG has an extremely low viscosity and needs to be used on a dripper or specific type of tank. 
p320
aVMore good news: you can DIY a juice with practically no PG. Bad news: to use in a Juul, you need to replace the PG with PDO or PEG 400. Those can be a bit of a hassle to get, but not much more of a problem than flavor concentrates that don't use PG.  
p321
aVAh, thanks had a hard time with that since I just switched from a juul to the Boulder and the juul always gave me like .5 strength so I was confused 
p322
aV 45 mg. Juul is 50mg. Mr. Salte is some of the best 
p323
aVI can't judge based on the JUul, never used it.  But I was around a 2 pack a day guy and the 12 did me pretty good.  I'd suggest trying out a couple 15ml bottles of each and dial in your comfort level.

aVI have the juul and wasn't a big fan of it -- bought the suorin air and I'm in love. Might be worth looking into.
p328
aVBreeze for sure. Similar to the iCare, but better quality. Plus you don't need to press any buttons, just straight pull like the Juul. And they're the same price!
p329
aVHad a JUUL, now I just run 25mg nic salt ejuice in a Nautilus 2 on top of a Innokin CoolFire Mini with 1.6 Ohm coils. Works wonders, saved me cash, and fits comfortably in my pocket always even while at work.

aVJuul vs. PHIX
p331
aVJuul is a lot more reliable and is smaller if that appeals to you 
p332
aVI\u2019ve had both so I can inform you on things with these two. First off with the pods, the Juul has way better flavor and the pods are cheaper, but they contain almost 1ml less than Phix pods. The juul has a smoother delivery while the phix hits harsher, but both give you that instant chill effect. Juul is smaller, phix is bigger. Juul is also louder when drawing, if that matters at all to you. I prefer the Juul over the Phix but either one is a good choice. 
p333
aVAnybody know how to refill Juno/Juul pods with your own juice?
p334
aVThanks I'll check that out. I was looking into the juul because of its nice size but that thing is way to much nic for me.
p335
aVHonestly it's flavor is much better then the Big Baby Beast I have used on a different mod. It also hits really hard but with good airflow. The Juul has been my go to for a while and the Tfv12 that I was using was not a good alternative neither was the Big Baby Beast. I only use 3mg juice and this tank is super satisfying
p336
aVHas anyone tried putting Juul e juice in a regular vape?
p337
aVVoltage under 10 is still crazy. Juul liquid is more than double the strength of anything you're supposed to put in a sub ohm setup. Just be careful. 
p338
aVJuul or Juno?

aVNo, but I hear with the new TFV256 Incestual Son of Dragon Lord you can buy attachments to put pods in it.  The one deck allows for up to 6 Juul pods to be attached, allowing you to take as many as two pulls!
p340
aVI like it a lot. I bought it for when I'm stressed at work and need a quick fix and it does the job. Had a juul too but I like the air a lot better.
p341
aVGet a juul, sourin air, or sourin drop. Use nicotine salts. You will not want cigs anymore. 50mg. 
p342
aVSounds like pods are for you. Please **don't** get any Smok products. Though I have not used one, I would suggest Phix, Juul or Sourin Air. I'm sure the more experienced ones will chime in.
p343
aVWhat mod?  Also how do you like that berserker. I\u2019ve been looking at them but don\u2019t really understand how the mil works with a big tank. Have only used sub ohm tanks but used to use the Juul pretty regularly and miss that tight draw. 
p344
aVVoopoo newbie . the berserker is much better flavour then the Juul. It's a bit tricky to build but when u get it it's fine
p345
aVJuul

aVSome companies such as Juul require a sign-on-delivery to confirm that you're 21 in certain states.

aVJuul usage Day 13-38: 34 days without a cigarette. I was feeling great till last night.
p348
aVIt\u2019s just frustrating because how could I be a 17 year pack a day smoker. Who chain smoked and get nic sick all of a sudden? Is the nicotine in cigarettes that different? Also I had been using the JUul for about a month. Why didn\u2019t that happen before? Maybe just the perfect storm of occurrence? 
p349
aVthat's understandable, almost all parents when you're younger don't want you to inhale nothing, they try and control what you do. \u000apersonally after I quit smoking pot I felt the same way; I needed to puff on something to help mimic smoking weed, my parents don't really care, yet I've never done it infront of them; and they don't search my room or personal space. \u000aI guess in your current state, you should maybe not get a mod and tank, especially when it's a lot of items to keep hidden from your mom. \u000amaybe you should buy a baton, or a breeze or something like the Juuls, not necessarily a juul since those are expensive, but a nice MTL vape pen will work, especially since that's really small, and all you need is salt nic juice, which you can buy anywhere and just hide the juice really well, keep the extra pods in like a old shoe box or somewhere hidden,  and keep the vape pen in your pockets or something, don't leave it lying around ever. \u000ayou should be fine if you can get your hands on a small MTL vape pen since those are inconspicuous and you can always just say it's a " power bank " if anyone asks. 
p350
aVGet a juul. High nic to kill the nic cravings. Then use your snow wolf and smm for the hand to mouth of it. Make sure and use low nic juice(3) for the smm.\u000aThis worked like a champ for my wife. She still does this as a matter of fact.
p351
aVI agree. I have the Juul and the Suorin Air and that's what did it for me. They both use nic salts which much more resemble the hit off a cigarette and allow higher nic without being too harsh.\u000a\u000aStill use my regular mod but any time I get a BAD craving, I take a few rips off my juul or air and I'm good to go.
p352
aVImaging integrating a Juul type of setup into a cell phone. 
p353
aVI've found they don't really care if you have a Juul style, but I wouldn't really even think about pulling out an actual mod at the bar. No matter what the vape smells like, people tend to not like a cloud of anything in their face unless they're the one producing it.
p354
aVNeed to quit juul.
p355
aVI mean as an athlete i haven't noticed a difference in my performance i have been smoking my juul for about a month
p356
aV2 pods a day is pretty intense, thats a LOT of nicotine. It takes me about 2-3 days to get through 1 pod as a recent convert from smoking. Its soooo strong with the high nic i cf t take more than 1-3 puffs at a time.  \u000a\u000aId try to start a lower nic juice. I think one of the juul lookalike devices has 5 and 2.5% juice catridges. Maybe that would be an option. 
p357
aVMight try out the 2.5, do you recall the name? I rip the juul all day and only get a real head buzz on the first drag when I wake up.
p358
aVThe mi one or mi pod is a good option if you want something small. Even the limitless pulse is similar to the Juul but the pods are refillable up to 8-10 times. 
p359
aVSorry i dont recall. Saw it on YouTube tho. \u000a\u000aA start might also be to just try and limit yourself to one cartridge a day.  Im personally switching to a refillable mod soon so i can buy low nic juice. I feel the addiction sinking jn with the juul and i use it a little more every day.  I feel lime to me its even more addictive than smoking was if thats possible. 
p360
aVi +1 this\u000a\u000asuorin air is the only thing that i was able to stop juuling with 
p361
aVThe 30mg juices use nic salts and are made for pod systems like the Juul or MyJet, not for sub-ohm tanks. U don't wanna vape that stuff in a regular tank, it's meant for MTL really
p362
aVHey guys! I was big into vaping a couple months back and made the stupid decision to sell all my kits because I was convinced I was gonna quit. I now have a Juul and it is hit or miss. I was thinking of getting the Mi One
p363
aVWhat's everyone's opinion of JUUL?
p364
aVquit smoking, got a juul, 3 weeks no smoking! whats next? help a noob!
p365
aViStick Pico + 18650 Battery + Nautilus 2 (if you want it to draw like the Juul) or the Super Tank Mini (if you want it to draw like a bong)\u000a\u000aThen get some 12 or 18mg juice if you grab the Nautilus and some 6 if you get the STM. Then you can ween yourself downwards from that. 
p366
aVSalt liquid suggestions? (Juul)
p367
aVYeah that's why I vape 0 Mill juice because I never smoked cigs before ; but my theoretical Subaru that is always hard parked , because it's too low to drive, looks so much better on Instagram when I'm"blowing mad clouds bruh" ! \u000a\u000aI  vape 3mg /or juul , after quitting a 10 pack year habit. Started in 2013! Time flies, almost as fast as vape tech changes huh?
p368
aVThe breeze is the fucking best Fuck everyone saying oh eat a juul *smd*
p369
aVSecond on the Joyetech eGo AIO. It was an awesome starter set that I could carry anywhere. And cheap. Another option is the JUUL. 
p370
aVJuul
p371
aVCorrect, Juul with cool mint
p372
aVOld-school diamond cutout juul. Damn man that's a collector item by now :)
p373
aVI still have many mods in my rotation. The Juul is just what I use when I don\u2019t necessarily have time for long breaks to get my nic fix with my 3mg cloudy setup. 
p374
aVI could never make the mint last in my juul. Id suck it down in like. Idk. 5 hours. Was so god damn good. Especially with some coffee. Oh fuck. So god damn good. Fuckin walk into maplefields (gas station) pump that dark magic into that cup, guzzle it down, and pull sweet ass mint into my lungs. Fuck those were good times
p375
aVSame boat here, personally I prefer the JUUL when I'm in public and I need a stealthy nic fix-up.\u000a
p376
aVClosed system means you have to buy cartridges/pods pre-filled and can't refill them yourself.\u000a\u000aAnything designed to have the end user put juice into is an open system vape. \u000a\u000aMost things sold at vape shops will be open system except Juul, Njoy, and similar.\u000a\u000aAsk "Show me how to refill it" and if they show you pre-filled cartridgs/pods, that's a closed system.
p377
aVJust picked one up today. I\u2019ve been using the Juul on and off for almost a year now because of the convenience and it has by far my favorite nicotine level out of any vape I\u2019ve tried. It\u2019s super weird that I can\u2019t find anything about the Ciro online though, the package really has minimal info about the product. How do you check how charged it is while using it? Does anyone know what the actual nicotine amount is? I\u2019ve only tried the nectar flavor so far, the cartridge seems to be going fairly fast but I definitely enjoy how much flavor you get from it along with how smooth it hits. 
p378
aVthey aren\u2019t lying. i watch them do it. i go in with my best friend to buy 50mg nic salt juice with him. i know for a fact that they chain vape 45-50 all day for a month or two and they can quit anytime they want because i\u2019ve seen friends of mine quit. they use juuls, juno\u2019s, suorin airs and aspire breezes if you\u2019d like to look up the device they use. 
p379
aVThe Juul uses nicotine salts. It's going to be high in mg because the voltage is miniscule.
p380
aVYou're right about not getting addicted, but in those low wattage devices nic salts with high nic levels are pretty common. It's the same kind of juice in the juul. 
p381
aVJuul defective or just lousy product?
p382
aVi just got mine last month :( im disappointed , my juul lasted longer :/ 
p383
aVWhen I was quitting cigs (unbelievable I succeeded), a cig a like helped greatly in addition to vaping. I\u2019d use the JUUL with the tobacco flavor (recommended) and/or the mint (former menthol smoker) after meals, when drinking/partying, drinking coffee, etc. All \u201ccigarette triggers\u201d called for my juul while I was getting used to vaping. I attribute my success in quitting to cig a likes and vaping combined, one alone was not sufficient. Has she tried a cig a like? Such as a juul or a logic/blu? The juul tobacco flavor is spot on for Marlboro reds. 
p384
aVThinking About Trying Juul
p385
aVJuuls I take a couple hits on and I\u2019m fine for a while, mods are more fun and need a bunch of hits for me to feel anything but I have both. Juuls are amazing for concealment
p386
aVJuuls have virtually eliminated any desire for an analog, with a real nice form factor. But god damn that nic level is something else.
p387
aVJuuls really knock you on your ass, and personally I don't really feel the need to vape unless it's somewhere I can use my box mod (e.g. parties, dorm, friend's places).\u000a\u000aI think the nic is great but I'll say the flavor really isn't that great.\u000a
p388
aVI love all the new pod system, however the Juul is not as good as the PHIX by MLV. I think until today with all these pod system products on the market, the PHIX is still the best. 
p389
aVKeep in mind Juuling is a lot more expensive than vaping if you want to chain-vape. I go through about a pod a day which adds up to roughly 35 dollars a week.
p390
aVAlright here we go! Need recommendations for my first mod and tank. (Coming from a Juul)
p391
aVDoes it produce more vapor and have more flavor than a Juul?
p392
aVIDK i´ve never tried a Juul, but you can check [THIS](https://youtu.be/-YtUnCjecqE?t=14m26s) to get a sense.
p393
aVThey taste better than "normal" e liquid imo. You get the full flavour without the taste of the unflavoured VG/Pg and nicotine. They just give a monumental throat hit and nic rush!\u000a\u000aIf you were interested, have a look at the Juul. Uses 45mg (or 50mg? Not sure as I'm in the EU and they're banned over here) but in a tiny portable stick. Lots of people love them!
p394
aVThe nicotine itself is more expensive. The juul is salts as well as most other pods. The device doesn't necessarily have to be a pod system, you can run salts in a nautilus mini no problem. 
p395
aVyes juul's are nic salt, suorin air is a very simple system as well you just turn it on and take a pull to hit the vape.
p396
aVI feel you. I currently use 6mg too, and for the \u201cfix\u201d I also have a juul to quickly help myself when I feel sleepy at work or when I feel like my body need some nic to function right. Before the juul, I would chain vape a lot with 6mg juice (I also use 2 different setup at a time to switch in case one get hot due to too much vaping) and I also on/off with actually smoke 1 or 2 cig a day when I need a big pump of nic, also any regular juice with higher nic than 6mg make me sick. With the juul, now I\u2019m cig free for 2 months already. Recently with the \u201cice\u201d edition of juice coming out which have added menthol to the flavor, I could start vaping on 0mg juice just fine and not feel like craving nic like with non-menthol 0mg juice (of course I had to puff on the juul once in a while but when I\u2019m at home and can chain vape, I can easily vape 0mg and feel fine). \u000aSo in the end, I found out I\u2019m craving the menthol element more than the nic itself. If I\u2019m stressed out, I still need nic nonetheless, but in general, I can go on with 0mg. \u000aIf you can, I\u2019d say try some juices that have menthol/fruit in their mix with menthol as the main flavor and see if it helps in the long run.
p397
aVWhatever you do, don't get him something pen-styled that will break like a pencil in his pocket. I do my fair share of rough housing in the garage and bending down or kneeling has broken more pen vapes than I'd care to admit. To be honest, your dad might be a great fit for a Juul, which is about the size of a 5pack of wrigley's gum, and costs about 50 bucks. You can get them at most convenience stores and gas stations too, and refills arent hard to find. There are no buttons on it to fool with either.\u000a\u000a\u000aIs it an option to get him on concentrates? There is -some- overlap on parts with concentrate atomizers. Luckily, most of the best atomizers for vaping concentrates happen to be the cheapest crappiest ones that we vaped nicotine with back in the day and they happen to be in surplus and cheap, usually.\u000a\u000a\u000aAs for flower herb, I really can't say it enough. Find a PAX by Plume. They really wrote the book on rock solid vapes that last forever. The new ones dont even have to be plugged in to charge, they just sit on a dock. You can find them used for less than 100 bucks, or sometimes you can get them new for about double that.\u000a\u000a\u000aThere is a very big difference though. You can guarantee that if it is cheap, it's not going to vaporize the herb, it's just going to combust it, and that's such an unpleasant experience, I just wouldn't recommend it. There are so many parts that could melt with that type of heat in there, it'd be like smoking a bowl out of plastic and metal.
p398
aVVaping is personal, so it all still depends on the user. I started with the Kangertech Topbox Mini Kit (Kangertech KBox Mini + Toptank), moved to the Vaporesso Revenger with NRG Tank, then got a Uwell Crown 3, bought a Smok ProColor Kit (with Smok TFV8 Big Baby Beast Tank), and now I've bought myself a Mad Hatter RDTA, Kylin RTA, and Ammit RTA. \u000a\u000aMy SO on the other hand started with the Smok V8 Stick with TFV8 Big Baby Beast Tank then moved on to get a Smok T-Priv. I gave him my matte black Uwell Crown 3 Tank as I got myself a blue one. This is his current setup. He got himself the TFV8 RCA deck. He has a Kylin RTA and Ammit RTA on the way, plus the glass extension for his Big Baby Beast for use with the RCA.\u000a\u000aWe both default to sub ohm vaping because we like the flavour explosion in our mouth plus the sensation of inhaling vapour. What was difficult for my SO with quitting wasn't the fact that he craved the nicotine rush (though he does this from time to time especially when vaping my 0 mg nicotine juices), but the sensorimotor sensation of inhaling and exhaling smoke.\u000a\u000aI am thinking of getting him a MTL set up with high nicotine however for the rare times he's seeking that nicotine rush. Perhaps I'll look into the Juul. He won't be using it everyday. Probably just once a month.\u000a\u000aAgain, it's all personal preference. What works for you works for you. No perception on what's "mainstream" should ever dictate to you how you should vape. If you ever feel differently because makes you feel inferior for loving MTL, then just give them the middle finger and vape on.
p399
aVWhat juice do you use in it?\u000a\u000aI ordered some 40 and 45mg salt e juice and I am worried that it might be too strong because I hear the Sauron air hits harder than the phix or juul.
p400
aVI use 30 in my suorin. I use this when I\u2019m out and not hitting it nearly as much. 30 is my sweet spot. I tried a friends 50 and damn that shit hit way harder than a juul. So def under 45 for myself 
p401
aV45 is fine in it if it's salts. I use it and find it smoother than the juul, if the throat hit is a concern. 
p402
aVNyc exclusive Juul pods are here!!!!!!!
p403
aVjuul. Really strong and produces a similar amount of smoke to a cigarrete. Uses nicotine salts in their cartridges.
p404
aVI haven't really explored much with nic salts but whenever I do mention starter kits and nic salts, people always mention the Juul to me. Maybe look it up and see if that will suit her? 
p405
aVNah I ended up selling it it was just too much maintenance for me you know? I prefer just a simple juul or suorin where you don't have to replace coils, prime it etc.
p406
aVIt has to do with the large amount of vape you get at once. You can Vape a juul with 50mg juice and a small amount of cloud and get a satisfying hit or you can vape a sub tank with 6mg and get a big cloud and still get a satisfying hit. I remember when 12 mg was 'low' as well but we were also getting weak ego twist hits 
p407
aVI\u2019ve been using a Juul for 13 days. So idk. 
p408
aVI\u2019ve been using a Juul for 14 days. Haven\u2019t had a cig in 9. It\u2019s still not as good as a cigarette:( I was doing really well but yesterday I felt like shit. Maybe the withdrawals are coming in waves? I\u2019m also very bloated and my back hurts. Just a little in the morning 
p409
aVIdk what I want anymore hahahaha I think I want a CIGARETTE that is maybe why I\u2019m feeling so weird. I\u2019ve been using a Juul for 14 days. Haven\u2019t had a cig in 9. It\u2019s still not as good as a cigarette:( I was doing really well but yesterday I felt like shit. Maybe the withdrawals are coming in waves? I\u2019m also very bloated and my back hurts. Just a little in the morning

p411
aVEver since I quit and started vaping my back hurts in the morning. I\u2019m bloated af. Less relaxed, aches and pains, anxiety. The fuk you call that? Maybe it is mental but that\u2019s just the way it is. Maybe the Juul ain\u2019t cutting it. My addiction was strong. I\u2019m also an ex drug addicted. I am an addictive personality. The hell you want from me lol you giving me tough love?
p412
aVI feel like an RDA isn\u2019t reasonable when you\u2019re busy or out and about. I feel like if I went that route I\u2019d be annoyed and just go back to cigs. BUT. I feel like an RDA is a good at home device. If high nic loses its flavor, a Juul has a lot of nic and I am fine with the flavor. I feel like anything else would taste amazing to me lol 
p413
aVAn RDA isn't a total pain in the ass when out and about, IMO. Luckily though squonking is a thing, and a damn good one at that. Throw a single coil RDA on top, and one 18650 and the juice in the mod lasts me a full work day. I'd actually like to try a JUUL/nicotine salts, I hear good things about the rate/method of nicotine absorption with salts.
p414
aVJuul isn't the best out there, even for stealthy MTL. Japanese Tobacco International also has a minority stake in the business. I don't know if that's relevant or not, but I don't feel comfortable supporting tobacco companies. \u000a\u000aIf you're looking for something satisfying but not a subtank try to Saurin Air. You get a bit more vapor and better flavors.
p415
aVYeah I know what you mean.\u000a\u000aHonestly I'd say your best bet is to stay with the juul or get a phix or something else with salt nic because it is the closest to a cigarette that your gonna get.
p416
aVNice! 17 year smoker here. Haven\u2019t had a cig in 9 days. Been using a Juul. 
p417
aV100 percent get a juul or a phix for Ur mum.\u000a\u000aThey use salt nicotine which absorbs faster and has better throat hit like a cigarette and it uses pods so it's extremely simple to use and there won't be any problems usually.
p418
aVTrying to get off the old cigs and finally took the plunge. My local vape shop came highly recommended and I ended up leaving with this (VooPoo Newbie 80W + Tobeco Mini Super Tank).\u000a\u000aI told myself I just wanted to quit smoking -- that I wouldn't "get into" vaping, but man, the bug has bitten me hard. I guess I should've seen it coming given that I'm already into diy/electronics and used to work as a low voltage tech. Already have plans for my first RDA and a new mod so I can give the girlfriend this one (she liked mine so much she said she'd give quitting a try). I just can't put this thing down.\u000a\u000aI haven't quit yet completely, but in two weeks I'm already down to ~5 analogs a day (from 2 packs a day). Plan on picking up a juul to help for those few hard cravings I keep getting (w/coffee in the morning, right after work, and right after meals are tough for me). Thanks for all the inspiration y'all.
p419
aVjust got a juul, need some help
p420
aVYou hit the mod for 5 months without experiencing this? Then you stopped hitting the mod for a month? During that month did you hit the Juul?
p421
aVJUUL usage day 9-12: It has been 9 days since I\u2019ve had a cigarette. 9, frickin\u2019, days.
p422
aVAfter breaking 4 Juuls, I switched to the Phix, which I actually liked better, until it broke. Now I'm vaping on an Aspire Plato. The juice in a Juul/Phix is definitely more satisfying when trying to get off tobacco, I personally would say wait until after the cravings end before you try and switch to something that is going to give you a straight to lung hit because it doesn't resemble a cig as much as the mouth the lung high nic hits do 
p423
aVI have personally never liked a tank/mod mouth to lung setup nearly as much as the Phix or Juul and there is only like one company that sells juice remotely close to the juice you are currently vaping in the pods. Just letting you know before you try to upgrade or whatever and can't get nearly as good of a hit
p424

p425
aVSo I\u2019m fucked is what you\u2019re saying. Because the Juul isn\u2019t cutting it right now. 
p426
aVThanks! If it's the mi one though, no worries? Because the battery is in the unit, if not I have my juul.
p427
aVcheck the Juul, Eleaf icare mini or Aspire Breeze and see some reviews about them.
p428
aVJuul is probably the best way to go to quit smoking. 
p429
aVOthers will probably suggest the Juul, and they're not wrong. However I'll go against the norm and suggest either a SMOK Stick v8 or Kangertech Subvod. Both very nice pen style vapes that will produce a much better vapor and will probably last longer too.
p430
aVIf you smoke lites or anything less than a pack a day, do not go with the juul. You will find it very harsh and way too strong. Go with the icare mini and just buy your juice with your preferred nic concentration. Go with any refillable ultra portable device, really. That way you can tailor the experience to your own personal preference. 
p431
aVCan you refill the pods yourself? The insane pod prices always were a big deal breaker for me. I just recently realized it's possible with a Juul which spiked my interest in those tiny setups again. Haven't pulled the trigger yet but I'd really like something very portable and lowkey for when I'm out and about.
p432
aVIt can mess up your juul though
p433
aVThat's a pity, I think the Juul is meant to be similar
p434
aVGet a juul. More on the pricey side but IMO it\u2019s the best MTL device out there. 
p435
aVDay 7/8 using JUUL: I have been going through a pod every 1 1/2 days - which is pretty good. So I actually must be getting less nicotine than I did with cigarettes-also good.
p436
aVThe vapour probably shot to your lungs because the tank and coil was for Direct to Lung hits with sub ohm vaping. Your Juul is MTL and offers, as close as possible, the experience of smoking a cigarette. \u000a\u000aYou just experienced the difference between a MTL set up and a DTL.
p437
aVJuul pod contains "50" mg of nicotine in each pod per milligram of juice. I am not sure if they are using Nic salt, but I own a couple of Phix by MLV and I am hooked on the nic salt liquids. I recently just purchased the Eleaf iCare 2 which you can fill your own nic salt juices and the store by my house carries many freat flavors from popular brands that I can trust. So far I am loving it. I also have a few friends who uses Juuls on their daily basic but converted to the Eleaf iCare 2 because it's so much cheaper and last way long. The iCare last almost 2 days per charge and a 30ml bottle of Nic salt liquid is about $25 - $30. A bottle of 30 ml can lasts me up to 3 weeks. So I think you're looking to get a MTL device, the iCare is a device I recommend. It'a just about twice the size of a Juul but same length.
p438
aVjust get a juul. noob.
p439
aVDay 6 using Juul: Yesterday was my first day in 17 years without a cigarette.
p440
aVAwesome, a lot of people are saying it works, I'm waiting for my starter kit to come in the mail, hopeful but unsure if will really be able to quit smoking. 19 year habit up to 2 packs a day sometimes. Tried vaping a little before but never got into it just heard of the juul the other day and tried a few hits from a co-worker.
p441
aVchill man, Im realizing now you kids are blowing fat clouds, the juul just doesnt do that
p442
aV&gt;you kids are blowing fat clouds, the juul just doesnt do that\u000a\u000aCigs don't blow fat clouds either, but it's still obnoxious to do around other people in public areas, let alone in a restaurant.\u000a\u000aAnd I'm definitely not a kid, yet you're the one acting like one.  Like I said before just use some common sense... not everyone is familiar with what vaping is, and the way to educate them is NOT doing it in a fucking restaurant full of people and acting confused as to why you're getting dirty looks.

aVHow is the Juul working for you?
p447
aVThere is only JUUL!!!
p448
aVMy local shops seem to favor phix over juul. I picked one up last week and honestly I'm a pretty big fan. 
p449
aVI still have regular box mods and I\u2019ve also started using the Phix it\u2019s a bigger version of the Juul 
p450
aVHow much do Juuls cost?
p451
aVI have been dipping for 5 years and smoking on and off, picking up a Juul after work today
p452
aVCan confirm. At my college unless it's a JUUL then vaping is looked at as tacky 
p453
aVSo from my understanding, your looking to get back into vaping, but don't know where to begin. Thats completely understandable because getting into these kinds of things can be tricky at first. Let me start by explaining about vaping, that might be easier to understand. So you obviously know that vaping is an alternative to the sticks, to help you quit. To understand Wattage, and resistance. These are some basic electricity principles that we should look at. Wattage how fast electricity can be pushed through a wire or circuit, resistance is the wires ability to resist the flow of electricity, and voltage is the amount of electricity flowing through the wire. Typically for vaping, we look at wattage and resistance (resistance measured in ohms) to determine what we run our mods at. There are formulas that help you identify what wattage you should be running at when it comes to vaping, but for the most part, a pre-built coil will allow typically tell you what to run you wattage at for mods. So for example, i have my mod with a uwell crown three tank. The pre-built coils i use are labeled on the side with the resistance of the coil, and the range for wattage i should run at. So lets say i have a .2 ohm coil, i can typically run at 70-90 watts without burning the coil out. Now to address what you stated earlier about you coil for your alien, yes, your coil is bad and needs replacing, they sell coils online and in local shops, when you go in, just ask the local shop "hey i need new coils for my X tank" (X being whatever tank your using) From my understanding, you have a kit for your alien, so you probably have a tfv8 baby beast, or big baby beast.\u000a\u000aNow that you understand better, let me make a recommendation for you to try that will help you quit the sticks all together. The device i'm linking is called a juul E-cig. The way these little guys work is you just puff on it like a normal cigarette, and after a certain amount of time, you replace the pods which contain the ejuice. This is a neat little device thats portable, easy to use, and user friendly.\u000a\u000aLink: https://www.juulvapor.com/shop-juul\u000a\u000aIf you have any other questions please ask
p454
aVHeavy smoker here and on day 5 of using the Juul and it does work. \U0001f44d
p455
aVWhen I graduate from the Juul this device from eLeaf looks like a keeper. (iStick Trim)
p456
aVhonestly; if youre coming off the juul, id reccomend a Mi-One. theyre about half the size of this, and the tank is internal. its made for high mg juices. for example, i have 45mg nicotine salts in mine. 
p457
aVDay 4 Juul usage: Smoked my one cigarette today and I felt absolutely terrible. That\u2019s a good sign.
p458
aVSo basically ur juno is a goner. Their support is fucked and you will not be able to get a replacement. Better off getting a juul
p459
aVDAY 3 Juul usage: At work, feel weird. Want a cigarette - haven\u2019t had one.
p460
aVIt\u2019s a Juul so the pods are like 5% which comes out to something crAzy like 50mg or something. Someone can confirm this. 
p461
aVThe juul is a pod system with nic salt juice, I believe each pod has around 45-55mg of nic. It got my dad off cigs after 40+ years of smoking.
p462
aVThe tingling might be the pods maybe use another pod? And ive been using the Aspire Breeze with CRFT Nicotine salt. Works pretty well together. I used to use the Juul but ive been exploring a lot more devices and this was the best by far although it is a lot bigger than the juul. 
p463
aVDay 2 using a Juul: Yesterday I had one cigarette. Today I am having just one.
p464
aVI have a Juul as well as a regular box mod. I don't quite get a taste from the Juul since I'm using the mint pods. I feel as if they don't deliver flavor, but I definitely taste the flavors from my box mod. \u000a\u000aWhat flavor pods are you using? 
p465
aVthe cough will go away as your throat gets used to it. more good news, if you keep using your Juul or any other e-cig for that matter, you will eventually not want even the one cigarette.  As mentioned by another commentor, pod systems won't give you a whole tonne of flavour, so if you're wanting more of that you may want to look at a mod/sub-tank system.
p466
aVYeah that's true, I suppose with the 45 or 50mg nic salts in the Juul over-nic can definitely be a legit concern. I started with 12mg in a vape pen, and after my first session thought I had made a giant mistake because my head was *spinning*. After that I got used to it though, and soon wanted more vapor. Within a few weeks I was already down to a 3mg juice in an RDA. I don't think that's necessarily the typical progression (or at least in that timeframe), but I know for me it's become a hobby, and almost an obsession. \u000a\u000aAlso don't beat yourself up too bad if you slip up now and then, but seriously, if you don't buy them it's nearly impossible to smoke them!
p467
aVWell I'd it makes you feel any better, most of those feelings that you got from a cig but aren't getting froma Juul are not from nicotine itself. It's from the additional chemicals that are truly the most harmful for you, but that the big tobacco companies spent decades developing for one, singular purpose: to increase the level and speed of nicotine absorption. So maybe you can get some euphoria from the fact that you're not inhaling arsenic and cyanide and such? 
p468
aVI am going to make an assumption, I'm not a doctor, I assume a low wattage device with high nic juice would proven better than a cloud chasing type setup. Maybe try a Juul
p469
aVDay 1 using a Juul instead of smoking cigarettes: Am I supposed to still want a cigarette? (Because I do.)
p470
aVAre you coughing while you are vaping or are you just coughing more now? If you're coughing while vaping, could be because the amount of nicotine in the Juul is pretty high and gives a strong throat hit. If you're just coughing more, it could be because when you quit smoking, you start working a lot of crap out of your lungs. 
p471
aVI both vaped and smoked for around a year.  It's been almost 5 years now since then and I still have to occasional cigarette (5 beers is apparently the breaking point for me but I only drink a few times a year).  \u000a\u000aIt took me getting on to something a little stronger than the Blue cigarette/evod type battery ecigs before they delivered enough nicotine for me so you may need something a bit stronger than a Juul. \u000a\u000aYou are coughing because your lungs are intaking a foreign substance, the same as when you smoked.  As they get used to it you'll cough less.

aVPeople will tell you Juul, but that's a $40 device and each pod runs you $5... You will run through two of those a day as you transition. You can refill their pods with your own juice, but the Juul battery does not last long.\u000a\u000aI recommend the Boulder Rock over the Juul. Exponentially cheaper, function over form, better battery life, no bullshit proprietary charger, but performs similarly.\u000a\u000aThe device, along with a 30ml of juice (about 30 refills worth...) is $20 from Bombies. Get 40mg nic salt to start and a few extra pods. \u000a\u000ahttp://www.bombies.com/starterkit-ns-bombies\u000a\u000aGood luck!

p481
aVJuul seems to be the favorite in my situation. I wonder about the salts and Benzoic acid and if that can cause any issues? Are both of these things already in traditional cigarettes?
p482
aVNobody knows.i was a  Pack a day smoker too, but stopped with vaping and then switched to JUUL because I liked it better. I've been using the JUUL for a year with no side effects other than continuing the addiction. It's potent, so keep that in mind if you want to quit.
p483
aVThe nic salts are actually found in tobacco, that\u2019s why it\u2019s so potent when you vape. It will definitely cover the nic addiction when you are quitting. Don\u2019t know about the acid. Just be wary about the juul, it can end up being as expensive as smoking. I was using one juul pod daily which is the price of a pack a day. Switched to a device similar but wasn\u2019t a pod system. Now it\u2019s cheap as hell. I can link you but the juul is def your best bet for starting off.

p488
aVI'm gonna tell you now man, the majority of vapes aren't a manual cig with a button. But if you want to get into vaping real quick and real easy, get a juul. They use disposable pods, and are probably one of the easiest to use vapes out there.
p489
aVI personally don't own the pulse but I have used it a good amount. I like pulse more than any other pod system (myjet, juul, phix, etc.) But I personally prefer the mi-one just because I rather fill with my own juice. I don't have any cons other than because of its size the coil is easy to flood. If you do like pod systems however, mi-one has developed their own pods so I recommend you check those out!
p490
aVYe I can't reccomend a juul or phix enough they are both good.

aVMouth to lung- like a cigarette. A pod system may help a lot, like the Juul. 
p496
aVIf you want something with a tighter draw like a cigarette there are plenty of ultra portable kits out there like the Juul. All of my friends got Juuls but they're replacement pods are in high demand where I live so we moved over to the Suorin Air and I've been loving it! Easy to fill with just and extremely small
p497
aVThe nautilus 2 tanks seriously surprised me. I have the 0.7 ohm coil in with 45mg mr salt e. Beats my icare and juul. Enjoying the early morning buzzes again!
p498
aVwhat's the best small vape that can still take high vg and produce big clouds? Juul and i care are cool but i'm not into vaping for the nic, i just enjoy those thick clouds you can make
p499
aVI like it so far. Very minimum spit back although it does happen occasionally, normally right after refill but it stops if you let it sit for a few minutes. I use 45mg juice right now because I'm coming down off of the juul. 
p500
aVI've tried both Mr Salte in 45mg and the Saltnic 25mg and and get a near identical throat hit to the juul with Saltnic brand. I was using one Juul Pod per day and got too expensive.
p501
aVAll these devices have some sort of issue. With the Suorin I felt that it was the most consistent device next to the Juul. I've been vaping subohm tanks and mods for close to 4 years now and lately I've been leaving my Mod at home when I go out. I'm confident that a full charge and a full tank in the suorin will last me the evening when going out.
p502
aVGet a phix or a juul for those cravings.\u000a\u000aIt uses 50mg nicotine salts so it feels exactly like a cigarette I haven't even used my mod in a few days
p503
aVAhhhh spirit blacks. That's what I smoked. Would roll my own. Fucking awful for me but tasty. \u000a\u000a\u000aI'd recommend picking up something like a Juul or picking up an Aspire Breeze and running some 24 nic juice. \u000a\u000aWith a vape there are two styles of inhaling MTL and DTL. MTL or mouth to lung refers to using it similarity to a cigarette, and you will want at least 24mg if you are using it that way, especially if you were smoking spirit blacks. DTL refers to a smoking it like a bong, and in that case I'd get 6-9mg if I were you. 
p504
aVBuy a juul starter pack.
p505
aVBest vape with similar form to JUUL but an open system.
p506
aVIt is not shaped like a cig but I have really been liking the eleaf icare.  Has adjustable airflow and can do a  really restricted mouth to lung or a direct to lung hit. Put nicotine salt based high nic tobacco flavored liquid in it and it really helps to get me over the craving then I go back to my tank.  There are a lot out there like it I have heard really good things about the juul.\u000a\u000aBasically look up pod based systems.  They will usually run higher ohm coils and have really small air ways.\u000a\u000aAnother option is mtl tanks as others have said.  There are a few new ones on the market that look good but I cannot comment on any of them.

aVlove the juul, mind broke so theyre shipping me a free one
p511
aVugh i have the phix, its way worse than the juul, but my juul got stolen XD\u000a
p512
aVHonestly if you're looking for a stealth vape and still want the nicotine I would go for a juul. I love my juul, gives a great buzz and lasts for a while, little vapor production too great for stealth. The only downside is constantly buying pods for the juul \u000a
p513
aVI second the juul. You can refill the pods with whatever juice you want. I sometimes use mr salt e 45 nic and it works perfectly.
p514
aVComplete noob here, know nothing about mods, so my local shop recommended this (Nano micro kit by Apollo) since I needed something small, and a juul has too much nicotine for me. \u000a\u000a\u000aAny tips and things I should know? When I say I'm a noob, I mean I don't even know how often I should change the coils and wicks. Can I carry it in my pocket normally? 
p515
aVYeah. I have a couple friends who can help, I just didn't want to get hooked on juul like everyone I know, it's way too costly. 
p516
aVIf you are indeed being serious, I suggest getting rid of all of your vape gear and sticking with a Juul or disposable e-cig
p517
aVJuul
p518
aVIf you get a juul you don't have to keep buying pods, you can easily refill it with any vape juice that you have, that's what I've been doing for the past few weeks and it works like a charm
p519
aVAvoid Smok. \u000a\u000aSmoat makes solid mods. The istick Pico is a good mod. \u000a\u000aWhat're you looking for? An experience like a cigarette or more vapor?\u000a\u000aSolid single battery mod is the Pico. Pico + Nautilus 2 is great for cigarette similarity, Pico + Super Tank Mini is great for more vapor. \u000a\u000aDual battery the Battlestar or Charon are solid choices. VooPoo Drag also. Then a Clieto Exo, Crown 3, or Super Tank Mini. \u000a\u000aOr if you want something that an AIO (all in one) device, I'd recommend the Ego AIO or Aspire Breeze. \u000a\u000aIf you want something that'll get you a strong nicotine fix and be discrete, the Juul is a great choice. 
p520
aVRegardless of your needs, I still highly recommended that pulse stick. It's like a juul but refillable and heck, don't we all need a stealthy stick for those ninja vape occasions? Plus, 25 bucks doesn't sound bad at all. Good luck on convincing your wife mate.

aVNic salts is different than nic in diy juice and everyday premium vape juice, it absorbs quicker and is intended for MTL vapers, not your normal DL sub-ohm tanks. It gives the small amount of vapor a more equal nicotine hit comparable to a cigarette. It is not intended for chain vaping, unless you are a chain smoker to begin with. Many people, like myself, aren't necessarily trying to quit the "act of smoking". I just wanted to save money and get rid of the stink. I use the Suorin Air and Icare mini with Mr. Salt-E 45mg nic salt. These are low wattage devices similar to the JUUL. They are Mouth to lung devices that only produce the amount of vapor a cigarette would, roughly. I use these primarily for work where I can't chain vape my everyday mod. They are great for that 5 min cig break during the day because they give me the nicotine effects of a cig, and I can wait an hour or two till the next break. At home, I use a mod with a restricted lung hit or MTL RTA burning around 25watts and I use the everyday nicotine that you all use, but that juice is only 12mg. That nicotine doesn't absorb as well as the nic salts and is very harsh at higher wattages, which is one reason DL vapers who use tanks like the tfv12 or Crown III only use 3mg nic, these people get their nic hit in the giant amount of clouds they suck in. If I tried using Mr Salt-E in a tfv12 and took that much cloud in, I'd probably pass out and get nic poisoning. It is your responsibility as a vape store associate to educate your customers. These devices are ment for MTL vaping for those who don't want to give up the "act of smoking", yet want to quit the stink. They are for people who have smoked 44 years at 2 to 3 packs a day and may want to ween them selves off nicotine but starting with a JUUL or Suorin for better success, keeping the "habit" as normal as possible. I've been cig free for 4 months after 44 years of stinkies. I love the act, I hate the stink. My 45mg nic gives me the same satisfaction as a cig did with the same amount of vapor as a cig. When I want more clouds, I reduce the nic. What I do see and don't like is high school kids buying JUUL to get that 5 min head rush from the high nic content. This will lead to the 44 year habit I've had. There are better things to get high on but obviously you can't tell them that.  So find out what your customers are trying to achieve. A long time smoker trying to quit will have better luck with higher nic content. If they want the cig experience then suggest a mtl tank with regular juice and 12mg nic. If they want to quit and also want DL type clouds, recommend 3 to 6mg nic. If they need the occasional cig break satisfaction then the Suorin Air, Icare / icare Mini or Vaporesso Aurora are great with nic salts.
p523
aVI've seen kids (my neighbors) as young as in 8th grade using and hitting a juul. Do you find that surprising?\u000a\u000aBecause of this I'm actually interested in it but I feel that I can use it for a while then stop. \u000a\u000aThoughts?
p524
aVYou said it "What I do see and don't like is HS kids buying JUUL to get that 5 min head rush from the high nic content. "\u000aI'm seventeen  years old and want to try the juul because of the buzz feeling that I constantly hear about this light headness.   And I'm interested in it because it's seems much easier then buying cigarettes or buying we*d in that case. \u000aThoughts \u000a
p525
aVI hope no vape shop sell you or postman delivers you a JUUL cause you aren't old enough. Second, don't start smoking. I'm 23 and I got addicted in college and I wish I didn't. I know it's easier said than done...but if you must try it, borrow a friend. The moment you invest in one, you will feel like you need to use it constantly. \u000a\u000aStay away from smoking. Nicotine is addictive.

p533
aVI was just gifted a juul from a fellow reddit vaper and gotta wait til next month to get some nic salts....any suggestions on decent and affordable brands or diy sellers?
p534
aVI would buy a few juul pod packs first. I like the mint and mango flavors the best! Then pick up some Mr salt e liquid or level up and refill your old pods with the flavors you bought! 
p535
aVLiterally had to be 0 nic, 100 mL in a day is nicotine poisoning levels. 100 ml of 3 nic=10ml of 30 nic=6ml of 50 nic which is the same nic as juul pods(53 nic technically but bear with me) and juul pods are .7 ml and equal to the amount of nicotine in a pack of cigarettes, now 6ml/.7ml per pod = 8.5 pods, which is equal to 8 and a half packs of cigarettes in one day which would surely land you in the hospital, and remember that is with the LOWEST POSSIBLE RETAIL NICOTINE LEVEL in vape juice.

p544
aVYe I'm talking about the juul and the phix specifically.\u000a\u000aThey are really similar to a cigarette and they both use 52mg with nicotine salts which means it's slot more like a cigarette throat hit/buzz and also they look really nice and are compact
p545
aVNic salt is made for those little aio pod type vape. I'm using 45mg Mr. Salt-E Strawberry Funnel cake in an ICare mini and a Suorin Air. It absorbs more/faster than regular nic so you only want 5 to 10 hits to get the equivalent nic of a cig, leaving you more satisfied and not meant for chain vaping. I use it for work where I can't chain vape, I take it outside for about 5 mins every hour and I'm good to go till the next hour or so. I use MTL tanks on my adv but only use 12 mg nic and need to constantly vape that with little break I between. Nic salt is no where near as harsh as say an 18 or 24mg of regular nic which to me is like swallowing razor blades, hence the 12mg regular nic.  NS gives a nice throat hit with little cig-like puffs and is why the JUUL is so popular.
p546
aVamerica, texas specifically. idk if it's just my town but in the bathroom at school today i saw 2 juuls, 3 suorin airs and about 5 or 6 junos. 
p547
aVthey're pretty much a cheaper juul. the pods are like 45mg nic so you can get buzzed off them in about 4 or so hits and they're small so they don't put out a lot of vapor. so basically what that means is just about everyone in my grade has one. 
p548
aVJuul wont let me buy pods SOS?
p549
aVMaybe a Juul?

aVThe MyJet is great and you can fill up the pods with your own juice. The juul is fantastic, but the pods are too expensive. I buy the salt based nic juice from level up vapor and it works very well. Hope this helps.
p552

p559
aVUse a Juul! 
p560
aVI would be going with a juul or something like that and some nic salts juice. 
p561
aVI typically vape 12mg nic with 70/30 VG/PG or 65/35 depending on manufacturer. I also use MTL style vape. If you use a DL type tank like the babybeast so many people start with, the nic level is kept lower (typically 3mg) because of the amount of vapor you intake compared to MTL style.  If you want to reduce the number of hits per day, the better option might be to use nic salts like the juice found in the JUUL. That has a mg level of 45mg but tastes differently and absorbs differently than freebase nic in the typical juice. Four to 6 hits gives you enough nicotine to satisfy for a much longer period and is not recommended for DL devices at higher wattages. Nic salts are meant for JUUL like devices such as the ICare (and Icare mini), My Jet, Von Erl, and other AIO devices with low wattages and MTL or restricted direct lung draws.
p562
aVis there anything on the market currently that is similar in size to a juul but doesn't require pods (i.e. refillable?
p563
aVI don't have one so I can't say for certain, but I believe you can refill juul pods
p564
aVIcare mini is what I got to replace my juul, I use 12mg lava flow with it and it's nice 
p565
aVDo you think 12mg would be too much with the icare mini. I'm used to the 50mg nicotine salts the juul offers 
p566
aVNice!!! If you're coming from smoking cigarettes I really recommend using a Juno or Juul they are cheap and reusable and have very high nicotine levels 
p567
aVI say use whatever keeps them from picking up the pack again. I'm not a fan of the capsule system of the juul personally but to each their own on the path
p568
aVApparently you can refill juul pods fairly easily.
p569
aVFrom my understanding the Juul uses nic salts, rather than the usual nic extract in usual juices. I believe you'll want to use ~25mg juice rather than 45mg, something to do with the way it's absorbed...
p570
aVAgree with u/didumstrax, JUUL uses nic salts, it's not as harsh as the freebase nic in everyday juices and absorbs differently. Check out Bombies juices Afterdark line of juices, they use nic salts up to 30mg and from the descriptions of their flavors, seem amazing. Also check out Mr Salty juices. I have the iCare mini and it's pretty loose for a good MTL hit so I use it for restricted direct lung hits when I don't want to lug my main vape. If you go to regular everyday type juices and want good MTL hits, look at the Aspire Zelos with the Nautilus 2 tank. The Nautilus line of tanks give the best MTL hits imho, but stock up on coils and only use 12 to 18mg nic.
p571
aVThat's for all the input. The icare seems most like a juul but there are probably better options, like the zelos. The juul is pretty MTL imo. I have an istick pico rn but I don't like it as much as my minikin v2
p572
aVOooh! Check out the Vaporesso Aurora, looks like a Zippo and it does give a great MTL hit, has pass thru charging and coils last a good while. Great stealth vape. I prefer the MTL hit of that over the mini, but if the JUUL is similar to the icare's then go for it, they just came out with a slightly larger V2 of the iCare too.
p573
aVTell umoms to start increasing your allowance so you can afford Juul.
p574
aVJuul or vape mod?
p575
aVJuul is more for smokers coming off cigs, so yes the hits are stronger, they use nic salt based eliquids in their pods which are usually around 50 mg or. something as apposed to a mod which you can Taylor to your own liking  
p576
aVAlso juul won't put out extremely big clouds.
p577
aVThat\u2019s all I wanted to know really, if I\u2019m 18 how am I able to buy juul? 
p578
aVWell a juul is a vape. It's mouth to lung like a cigarette, whereas a lot of people on this sub move to sub ohming which typically requires direct to lung hits and more power.
p579
aVAppreciate the response, Im guessing people In this group most likely prefer vaping to juuling. Is that because you can get more vapor equaling a stronger head rush?
p580
aVAppreciate the response, Im guessing people In this group most likely prefer vaping to juuling. Is that because you can get more vapor equaling a stronger head rush?
p581
aV"Juuling" IS vaping. I'm sure a ton of people here have a juul also jus to use while driving and stuff. \u000a\u000aYou're more likely to get more a headrush vaping a juul bc it contains more nicotine. But please don't tell me you're one of those kids that picked up a juul jus to get "high" off of the nicotine rush. 
p582
aVAs someone who started (and quit cigs) with a juul and moved on to sub-ohm vaping, there is definitely a difference. While the Juul hits harder with a nicotine buzz than any other I've tried, sub-ohm vaping definitely becomes cheaper in the long run and has such a huge variety of flavors it's unbelievable. Since I've switched, I don't think I've bought pods in at least 3 months
p583
aVJuul is what you're looking for, high nic and almost no vapor if you hold it in. That being said, you can't shoplift it, as they're really only found online\u000a
p584
aVThanks!\u000aIt was actually my friend that posted this lol but I've passed it on. Although his Bo seems to have a mind of its own right now, could be resorting to Juul.
p585
aVthe very popular pod system seems like it would fit you, maybe a bo or juul
p586
aVYeah I have a juul i use for stealth vaping but it just isn't the same as a good vape hit.
p587
aVA lower power MTL atty might work for you. If you play with your nic level, you can get a satisfying hit at like 20w that won't fog out the room, even with 70/30 juice. I like the Digiflavor Siren 22; it can go from a medium/loose MTL to a restricted DTL so it has a lot more flexibility than the Juul. 
p588
aV"rig" a juul pod?
p589
aVBáton vs JUUL
p590
aVIf you want some serious motivation, think of what happened to your dad thankfully he survived cancer, I'm not sure if he smoked or not but if you don't kick the habit cancer is possibly down the road.  What I would highly recommend is a juul.  It's a mouth to lung device about the size of a USB sick with a strong throat hit and a massive buzz.  I would start by purchasing that, that will easily kill your nicotine cravings and you will probably never touch a cig again, they have 5 flavors: creme burlee, fruit, mint, mango and tobacco.  My person favorite is mango. If you buy the starter pack it comes with 1 of every pod except mango.  You can by more pods in packs of 4 on the juul website for $15, you can also get pods in gas stations for $20-$28.
p591
aVI know it's hard man, but trust me I really think the juul will work for you, good luck!
p592
aVHey man it's almost been a week, did you pick up a juul?  If so how's everything working out for you?
p593
aVHe's making a joke that 15 year olds all have Juuls now. It's actually become a huge problem at my old high school with kids constantly vaping in the bathrooms
p594
aVoooooh....thought it was an implication that the juul isn't a good device to use, cuz I've been considering getting one.
p595
aVjuul gang
p596
aVIt's only because juuls have become insanely popular among 15 yr olds, but you're still right lol
p597
aVI just bought the aspire breeze. It's an all in one juul style mod that also has a button, if you prefer button fire over draw fire. \u000a\u000a\u000aI have enjoyed this thing so much. And I've used exclusively mechs for the last 10 months. 
p598
aVHow do they do on the power and juice consumption? \u000a\u000aI'm actually thinking of going with an even smaller setup (like an icare or a breeze) and even higher nic strength. \u000a\u000aI enjoy vaping but I'm addicted to nicotine... I see most people going down in nicotine but I seem to be going up. I hear the juul is nice but really expensive. \u000a\u000aIt's really strange, smoking cigs for 20+ years I would stick to pretty much one brand. With vaping I feel like I want to try everything. 
p599
aVMione or limitless pulse. Or even a juul if you dont mind buying their prefilled pods.
p600
aVWhen you can't find your Juul....
p601
aVif ur looking for something else compact and not too expensive i'd recommend a juul
p602
aVIf you like the juul get it. There's so much choice and people here will tell you different things and some of that advice will be really good and some advice will be so fucking bullshit it might even harm you. My advice is go with something you've already tried and you know you  like. 
p603
aVFor what it's worth I'll recommend a few cheap and good alternatives to the juul. If you want to vape like you're smoking a cigarette check out the Innokin Endura T kit range. They've worked for a lot of people I know. If you want to get into sub-ohm cloud chasing I'd recommend a Innokin Coolfire IV kit or the Eleaf istick Power 80watt kit. These kits are relatively cheap, have good reviews and come with built in batteries so you don't have to mess around with external chargers or the expense of buying extra 18650s, which is a big plus in my view for someone just getting into vaping. 
p604
aVNo buzz off a juul
p605
aVJuul help!
p606
aVI have had issues with my juul doing this. Try a new cartridge to see if it is just a defective cartridge. I had a defective cartridge one time.
p607
aVi just realized i said ileaf not icare, but yea i run an al85 and i cant really be blowing clouds in the factory but i might just do it its so cheap. I have a juul but those pods are so expensive i just cant do it. about how long do you get out of a coil on that thing?
p608
aVAh makes sense. I actually went with the 25mg. 45 scares the crap outta me just thinking about it. I understand it for something like the juul. But for anything but the juul it would be too much.
p609
aVIf you would like to have similar pull as a cigarette and a lot of nicotine I would recommend the [juul](https://www.juulvapor.com). It's a small stick that uses nic salts in pods to give you 50mg of nicotine. It hits very smooth with a throat hit and has very get downsides. It's a nice small kit that I believe would help you a lot.
p610
aVI tried the juul. I hated it. It felt like nothing it was like sucking on a straw. I need something with a stronger hit. 
p611
aVLook into nicotine salts ejuice, I've seen 48mg nicotine content and it's the type of juice in products like Vuse and JUUL. Not sure if you can find unflavored nicotine salt however.
p612
aVLook into maybe a closed loop system such as the juul or the limitless pulse. They use the nicotine salts that were talked about by someone else in this threat. The nicotine salts are a more highly concentrated structure of nicotine. Not just the mg/ml. It is absorbed into the bloodstream much faster and you actually get the same head rush that you do from a cigarette. It's a much smoother throat hit than a 50mg freebase version. You can order unflavored from nude nicotine if they ship to Australia. But definitely something to look into.
p613
aVI'd get the Ego AIO, Smok Stick V8, or a Juul. First two will hit with a bigger cloud and the Juul will hit like a cigarette. All solid beginner choices
p614
aVJuul was a huge let down
p615
aVprobably defective. contact juul and they'll send u a new one. they're the shit. you'll love it when it works properly.
p616
aVOr he can get a juul and buy a bottle of Mr salt E or level up salt juice and be way better off for less. 
p617
aVGet her a Juul or similar pod system device. Closest thing to hitting a real cig as you'll get I think
p618
aVThe Innokin Endura T18 or T20 I think would be a good choice, as would any mod that does at least 20W with a Nautilus mini. I got my friend, a smoker of 25 years to quit with the Nautilus mini. The Juul might be another one to check out, as would the Mi-one which Grimm Green swears is the best MTL vape he's ever had and I trust his judgement
p619
aVICare, Aurora, Breeze, JUUL, My Jet or My Von Erl are all auto fire e-cigs, just suck, no buttons
p620
aVLmao wow your totally right. I see it on the bottle now.\u000aSorry dude been up all night with my new born.\u000aI need to try me some nic salts for my 10 minute quick breaks at work! Get a JUUL with the refillable pods or something.
p621
aVJuul.  I quit smoking instantly with the juul and I was a pack and a half - 2 pack a day smoker for 15yrs.
p622
aVSeconding this. Cigalikes are what initially got me off smokes. There's no beating the ease of use and psychological benefits (digital/oral fixation, etc). Most important thing is to make sure there's always a charged battery (meaning get two or more if needed), and pods on-hand or at least locally available.\u000a\u000aFWIW, here in NYC, there's definitely more Blu and Logic e-cig carts available in nearly every store (in fact it's surprising to find a drug store or decent bodega without them), but Juul pods are in every good smoke shop and of course any vape shop. So pod availability in your area should probably be one of your main concerns. Juul does provide an auto-ship option though.
p623
aVHaven't tried logic, but I know Blu are harsh as hell, and you always have to have a bottle of water with you or something to drink.  I never had that problem with Juul.  Juul just felt so much more natural.
p624
aVsmallest they come is cartridge based devices like the JUUL and the Phix by MLV.\u000a\u000athat being said, there are plenty of small all-in-one vapes that are great for concealment.\u000a\u000athe Eleaf Icare, Smok Vape pen 22, wismec MY JET\u000a\u000athis totally depends on preference.\u000a\u000aJUUL and PHIX both use high concentrations of Nicotine Salts, which have twice as much of a nicotine hit, just alot smoother than free base.\u000a\u000aDo a little research and find which one is best for you.
p625
aVhttp://i.imgur.com/lmBKF5W.jpg \u000a\u000aMega volt and vapefly Nicolas with 45 mg juice. \u000a\u000aI have the cync also. It's a lot better than people say. They fixed the early issues.  I have the Icare go. No where near enough throat hit for me.  And inconsistent build quality.  The juul gets raves but it's very expensive for what you get.  
p626
aVWhat about the juul? 
p627
aVI've tried to like the juul. Honestly. But it really hurts my lungs. I like a nice throat hit but it hits way down in my chest and I cough hard. After a day of vaping the Juul my lungs ache for days. Plus the only flavor I like is their tobacco. I still have one and use it as an emergency backup at work but I pay for it for a few days after. That and it's a bit pricey. 
p628
aVBack in May I got an iStick QC200W and it came with a baby beast that I couldn't get into because Direct Lung is not smoking. I found the Aspire Nautilus atomizer and it's helped me quit a 3 pack a day, 40+ year habit, the first time I've been without a cigarette for more then a day. It has a great cig like draw and coils are available just about everywhere around me, but @ $3 a piece most places, I was going through them pretty fast with all the sweet coil killing juices. I decided to search for good MTL attys and discovered a few but I wasn't willing to pay $150 for an atomizer so I found clones for $25. The first one was a Digiflavor Siren 25 RTA, this one isn't a clone but was still cheap and I could make my own coils and wick them. It's been great but the MTL draw just isn't there like the Nautilus but this is when I discovered I do like restricted DL hits. Then I found the Kayfun 5 clone and it too, isn't quite right for MTL hits out of the box but I can buy restrictive orifices if I want. It's pretty close but it's mainly restrictive DL. I have the Coppervape Skyline coming in the mail any day now and it comes with a couple orifices to help adjust for draw and I can buy a pack of 8 different ones to help dial it in better. I'm considering the Squape RTA but again it will be a clone because authentic is about $160 and made in Germany.\u000a\u000aI just started experimenting with Temp control using titanium and SS wire to make coils and while it's not a perfected technology, it's been interesting and saves the wicks and prevents dry hits if you get it right, so they say. I have noticed my wick is lasting about a day longer than wattage mode. Making coils is cheap cheap after the initial investment that a little over the cost of 3 packs of replacement coils. These MTL attys can work with some tinkering, which helps me keep busy too. \u000a\u000a\u000aAs for nic content, I've noticed that some vendors don't even carry 12mg, which is what I burn but I've heard you can find vendors online that sell something called Nicotine Salts e-juice that have very high nic content. The JUUL cigalike pods come with this it and people seem to say the JUUL is great for getting people off the cigs.
p629
aVIf you want to really kick cigs, I would recommend the juul 110% it's 50mg nic but they use nicotine salts so it's not as harsh, it's a pod system mouth to lung vape with a nice throat hit.
p630
aVWant to bring my juul killer on fam trip, flying but only with a backpack, how can i get it through without everyone finding out
p631
aVSame buzz as a juul from a vape?
p632
aVWell, the guy was an idiot. 3mg is the lowest you can go really. Try 9 or 6. That being said, the Juul hits like a train due to nicotine salts. 
p633
aV3mg is not high at all. Its a pretty normal standard. \u000a\u000aThe difference in the Juul is that it is 50mg of nic, but its a tighter hit. If you were to put 50mg in a Stick V8 you'd probably pass out, barf, get really high, or a mix of it all.\u000a\u000aYou can go to 6mg or higher, but you will get a harsher throat hit, and lose some of the flavor.\u000a\u000aIf you've never smoked cigs I'd advised against using Nic at all. If you want a buzz do something different.
p634
aVI use the juul sometimes when I go places and I don't want to take my big mod, some of their juices are legit worse than the throat hit off a 50nic juul it's insane
p635
aVIs a juul a good starter vape?
p636
aVJuuls are very trendy among teenagers at the moment. I'm 19 and a bunch of my friends use juuls just for the head-high, and I have tried them many times. I have a vape and there is a huge difference between the two. Juuls are very harsh hitting, batteries don't last long, and the carts are expensive. Better off just spending an extra 20 bucks and getting a cheap starter mod like an eleaf pico.
p637
aVYeah ive used both and i know what a juul feels like, im close to getting either a juul or a smok nano one mod but idk its kind of better for the juul since its so descreet
p638
aVI suggest looking on YouTube and search for review shootouts. Search \u000aJUUL, my von erl, phix, Bo, cig-a-likes, Penguin, Aurora, iCare, Breeze. Others will also pop up as you watch. Personally, refillable ones I feel are the more economical option.
p639
aVYeah im probably just gonna get a juul
p640
aVWell it depends what you are aiming at. Considering that you want to keep it simple, nice and cheap then I would say to go for some AIO's. That way there is no hassle with batteries and such (wicking, wrapping and other stuff). You can also look into getting some easy devices like the juul. I've never used it, but read a lot threads here with positive respones.\u000a\u000aOtherwise you can just get a starter kit with a small mod. the AL85 for example. You can get some MTL tanks and pre-made coils. You'll probably get more flavour and more cloud production.
p641
aVJuul orange light blinking [HELP] OFFERING REWARD
p642
aVwow, I just looked that up because I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the Juul that was refillable. Dang the icare is affordable! Do you like it?
p643
aVYeah this is the first mod i've ever built in. and i bought the S/O the best starter kit my local store recommended. I previously used Pod systems such as the Juul and the Sourin Air but im having alot of fun with low-nic and good flavour juices in this first mod. \u000a\u000aSmall question, in the Serpent SMM are the included coils supposed to be such low ohms like .14?\u000a\u000aand Cheers. 
p644
aVNicotine most definitely suppresses hunger, but you shouldn't rely on it to lose weight. I got to into the habit with juuling too much and actually ended up losing some weight, mind you I didn't need to as I was already pretty thin. If you want to stop the snacking habit then I would say do 0 mg or 3 mg if you want a little bit of nicotine, but vaping shouldn't be used to stop eating.
p645
aVThanks for the heads up. I was planning on ditching it anyways and getting a juul or Phix instead. 
p646
aVStart with 6. If it seems too harsh or too much, go down to 3. If using a small device (1 ohm +, like the Icare, juul etc) then you will need like a 12mg or more juice.
p647
aVIt's gonna be kind of hard to say no starter kits since it's an all in one device.\u000a\u000a[The Smok Vape Pen 22](http://www.smoktech.com/kit/vape-pen-22) has a similar design, but a produces slightly more Vapor.\u000a\u000aIf you wanted to go even stealthier than that, I would recommend using nicotine salts in a [eleaf icare](http://www.eleafworld.com/icare/) or pod based devices like the [JUUL](https://www.juulvapor.com) and [Phix](http://www.majorleaguevapers.com/phix-starter-kit/).\u000a\u000aLet me know which one you like and I'll tell you about each and every one of them\u000a\u000a
p648
aVIt's a juul, mouth to lung pod system with a custom wrap.
p649
aVIf you think about it, people who vape 3nic but go through say 3 tfv12 tanks a day are actually taking in more nicotine than using the juul, the pods are only 0.7ml so you only take in about 40mg of nicotine over 3-5 days.  But people go through 45mg of nicotine a day with something like a tfv12, even at 3 nic.
p650
aVWhere do you get wraps for Juuls? I can't find any and I don't want to be scratching up the battery. 
p651
aVIt really does add up. You're more than fine I think. Honestly there probably is no such thing as too much juuling. It's probably all just my personal concern with how much I'm using and how much it's costing me. Trust me, it could be way worse and you are probably at a good place right now. Cutting back wont hurt but staying where you are at is fine too. Enjoy the juul man and remember everything is good in moderation. 
p652
aVMini mods have been making a huge impact on the market lately. Some of the hottest ones we know are Juul, Phix, and suorin air! What are some other mini mods that we need to look out for !? \U0001f32c

aVThc infused juul/phix pods

aVhandcheck. any love for the juul?
p655
aVJuul cancellation?
p656
aVIt's shit I know. The cravings come at weird points. I'd be lying if I told you I don't have cravings on a daily basis. I do. But the vaping helps kerb them and keep them Down too. \u000a\u000aI'd give it a go. And if you just want to try it I'd look at a pod based system first. Something like the JUUL or BO Pod system. 
p657
aVyou could start with a JUUL device, pretty straight forward and very similar to cigarettes, then work your way up to a box mod. 
p658
aVI've heard about JUUL that's the flash drive sizes pen correct ?\u000a
p659
aVMine was the 8th as well! Happy birthday buds. Also look into the Juul device OP if you like the Icare. Both are top notch ecigs. 
p660
aVI have both, my local shop started selling nicotine salt juices so you can get juul stength juice for the iCare, saves a ton of money on Juul pods
p661
aVGet a phix or a juul. I've been using my phix for quite some time now and see no reason to smoke anymore. It uses 50nic (5%). Can't say the pods are the cheapest things in the world though.  
p662
aVThe juul and the bo are some good choices if you want to replicate the draw and hit of a cigarette.
p663
aVHits way harder than the Juul feels better in hand and these "jelly" pods are the best salt flavor I have ever had. Pods are twice the size of juul pods as well.(I am comparing to the Juul because it is the only other salt nicotine pod system I have owned)
p664
aVIt's working pretty well for me and I had a pack a day habit, I still smoke a few cigs a day but this is helping. It feels way better in hand than the I are or Juul too and is way cheaper and more available than Juul. These jelly pods are fucking awesome too just as good as a premium eliquid that isn't salt based(obviously the flavor isn't as good as the flavor out of a nice tank or RDA.) Keep in mind that Juul pods are 5 % nic and these are 3.5, 3.5 is still equivelant to I believe 18 mg standard juice. I think it's just low enough that you get way better flavor than the jewel and high enough to keep cravings at Bay though.
p665
aVYeah it's a nice little system. The fact that people still pay extra to buy Juul cartridges when there are cheaper better alternatives out there is crazy(I am into sneakers though so I understand hype.
p666
aVyeah when people first started getting them in the states the nic salt pods weren't out here yet either so it got some mediocre reviews saying it wasn't as satisfying as the juul I think the standard non salt nic ones were kind of bad juice too, but now that were getting the salt ones they're starting to sell like crazy, I just ordered some mango ones hopefully Canada gets them soon at least you guys aren't run by a dangerously narcissistic madman though.
p667
aVWord, juuls are only us as well right? Juuls are pretty nice I think they're overrated though and part of the reason the pods are always sold out is because it's the cool vape to have for teenagers and vape stores really don't card often(around me at least)
p668
aVYeah no juul pods over here so no one really uses them, the Bo is nice but the pods have really horrible QC. i usually get 1 perfect one out of a pack of 4l3 the others either get cracked mouthpieces or have tight fits which screw with the airflow, but there isn't really anything in this price range that delivers the same thing.
p669
aVWe do have the pods in Canada now at VAPEVINE.  You can either call the store 519-915-VAPE or they will all be posted online @ vapevine.ca soon!   We are based in Windsor, Ontario but we ship across Canada every day.  We are impressed with this unit.  It has a little more airflow and flavour than the Limitless Pulse and the Juul....and the charging box system is just genius. 
p670
aVI prefer the Juul. You should try it
p671
aVYou should try the JUUL or the Joyetech Penguin, they're more satisfying and u can add ur own juice to the Penguin. One of the main reasons being that Big Tobacco is trying to destroy vaping and you're supporting Big Tobacco by using a Vuse, Blu, Mark Ten or Logic because they are all made by Big Tobacco companies.
p672
aVGet your mom to buy you a setup like Juul. VonEarl or something for out and about imo. I'll get downvoted. But you're 17. Not 12
p673
aVI've taken a hit of a JUUL device. It's something like 42mg nic and I was fine. I can barely hit 12mg nic without coughing up a storm. So while I'm not sure if the guy at the shops ratio is accurate, it makes sense.
p674
aVYeah that's pretty accurate. The way I see it is this. If you're using a 6mg juice and vaping 2 tanks a day while the tanks are 4mls then that means you're using 48mg of nicotine per day which is equal to about 2 packs of cigarettes. If you're using 30mg juice in something like a Nautilus mini or another MTL tank or pod system like the Breeze or Juul that uses 1-2ohm+ coils then ur only gonna go thru about 1-2mls a day cuz MTL tanks use much much less juice. So that means you're gonna get about 30-60mg of nicotine. I would recommend using 24mg juice in the Breeze cuz I think that would be closer to the 6mg DTL in terms of nicotine consumption. 
p675
aVSo maybe a juul or Bo would be good for you? Since you cheek it and then inhale
p676
aVHello, welcome to /r/vaping. I have a couple questions for you and I'll also address what you've already written.\u000a\u000aDo you already smoke or use nicotine products?\u000a\u000aWhat is your motivation to start vaping?\u000a\u000a&gt;I want one that looks like a standard vape kinda like this http://imgur.com/mKWFXrD or this http://imgur.com/uR3okrm i definitely prefer the first style tho.\u000a\u000aThe first style of vape is called a cigalike. They are a very old style of vape from when the industry first started, it's definitely not what we would call standard. You'll be spending just as much on those as you would the JUUL.\u000a\u000aThe second style of mod you posted is called Ego. They usually have a cartomizer in which the resistance does not go below 1 ohm. Depending where you live, your coils may be hard to find and you'll be ordering them online. This style is newer than the cigalike, but still old tech and definitely not the standard.\u000a\u000a&gt;i definitely dont want the vapes that are box shaped with the mouth piece bc theyre expensive and not my style. appreciate the help! \u000a\u000aWhile the shape of the vape is subjective to taste, the part about cost is just not true.

aVYeah thanks, all my friends use the juul and i know u can't control the nicotine on that
p678
aVIf you're doing this to bond with friends you probably don't want to get the Smok stick, it's huge compared the the JUUL. If go for the ICare mini. It fits in the palm of your hand and you control what juice you vape.
p679
aVAh i was actually gonna say maybe the Juul! its an okay device, not available here in the uk unfortunately and i hear the pods are very expensive, iof you want a vape like that i'd highly recommend the Eleaf ICare (:
p680
aVThe juul is freakin amazing bruh
p681
aVWould airport security question my juul in the carry on x-ray?
p682
aVJuul through airport security?
p683
aVAlright thanks. If you know what a Juno or juul is it's very similar to that. 
p684
aVI don't have a phix but I do have a juul. What I did to fix it was clean it with a q tips and isopropyl alcohol. With the pin issue I'd probably try and press the pin down slightly and see if it moves. If it can try to move it until it is level with the other pin.
p685
aVYes that's what I did. Still stopped working. This is the worst pod mod system I've used. Get a juul and save yourself time and money 
p686
aVSave you money and get a juul there about 50$ it'll deffineitley satisfy your cravings
p687
aVGet something like the Juul.
p688
aVEnvii fit is really nice and is much cheaper than the juul, and in my opinion 10 times better
p689
aVJUUL is the best answer here, it hits so close to a cig, it feels like smoking a cig but without the nastiness of a cig.  The second I picked up a Juul is the second I quit smoking almost 2packs a day for 15+ years, haven't had one since.
p690
aVAlso the cloud on the juul is comparable to that of a cigarette as well so its definitely not as hard on the lungs.
p691
aVDepending on what you like, Juul, Joyetech Penguin or Vaporesso Tarot Nank kit to get started. The most expensive of those is around $60
p692
aVGod, please ignore the people recommending fancy mods and sub ohm tanks. If he's quitting smoking and has for a long time you want a device that mimics a cigarette. Look up the Juul- it delivers nicotine extremely similar to a cig and is a great device. 
p693
aVJUUL
p694
aVNo more JUUL! AL85 camo handcheck!
p695
aVNo more Juul back go vaping! AL85 Camo handcheck!
p696
aVWere you looking for a device that has everything all together, or one that's more modular? The Juul is a great device, buying the pods for it can add up a bit but it's not that expensive. There's some other AIO (all in one) set ups that are good too. \u000a\u000aAs far as more heavy duty set up: Pico, Nautilus 2, and a Battery should put you under $75 if you want a full set up that'll last a long time. \u000a\u000aI'm assuming that it's a MTL (mouth to lung) device he wants, right? One that you hit like a cigarette?\u000a\u000a

aVeFusion Duo - but looking for a smaller mod.\u000a\u000aKayfun Mini V3 clone.  Can't remember off the top of my head the build I'm using at the moment but 26-28g kanthal around 2.0-2.5mm for 1.0-1.2ohms, 17W.  Any build in that range in the KFM seem to be pretty similar.\u000a\u000aThe KFM isn't my ideal atty though.  I'd really like to see a nice compact MTL RTA.  Something Serpent Mini sized, 22mm and only 30-40mm tall.  There are a few out there (Pico, Doggy Style etc) but they all seem to have plastic tanks - as my favourite MTL juice has banana those aren't really suitable.  If anyone has seen anything please let me know.\u000a\u000aDIY juice, usually a Nanner Bear clone, 12mg, 50/50.  I've started trying nic salts, (NudeNicotine's Signature) at 20mg.  I don't know if there's much advantage over freebase on my first mix with it - with regular MtL RTAs a least - maybe the Juul/iCare type devices are different.  Personally, I'm getting a little more throat/upper-lung hit, about the same nicotine 'buzz', but it's giving me some light acid reflux (normal for me if I've had too much nic).  Flavour does seem to 'pop' a little more with the salts over freebase though.
p699
aVI just got a juul and it is very good at soothing those cravings. 
p700
aVIf I were you I'd check out the Juul or the iCare.\u000a\u000aMaybe that is what you really need. Totally easy to use, high nicotine and low vapor. Just like a cigarette.

aVJuul is awesome, but kind of pricey. Elevator I care also great but very easy to break if dropped the right way. 
p704
aVJuul by pax. The pods can get pricey, but sounds like just what you need. 
p705
aVI did at first. \u000a\u000aThe JUUL is great in those situations. It really squashes even the drunk craving. 
p706
aVJuul?
p707
aVAgreed! Juul kicked all cig urges instantly for me.  From the second I first took it off the charger in January 2016 I've been completely cig free!
p708
aVOP doesn't know what you mean. He hasn't activated it yet. You have to keep ripping it hard, eventually the light will turn black as night and it'll be imbued with the power to Rip Fuggin Tits, the buzz will be so deep it'll let you see through time, and you'll be spewing massive clouds that don't dissipate. Ever. \u000a\u000aAlso ask /r/juul.
p709
aVIt's not the mod, Tanks are sub ohm. If you're interested in an above ohm tank, take a look at the Nautilus or Nautilus 2. Maybe an Eleaf iCare device or Vaporshark Minnow. Possibly something like a Juul, Von Erl, MyJet.
p710
aVI carved a nicotine molecule on my juul bcuz I'm mole-cool
p711
aVthat's pretty cool\u000a\u000aalso, it seems crazy to me how old the juul is and nothing has come along that really compares to it. pods have grown more popular but there's nothing as compact or as fresh and innovative as the juul.
p712
aVI don't think these are shitty at all. I've tried plenty of devices and still have some but this is the way I vape. I love the flavor of these, the nicotine satisfaction, and the simplicity. I quit smoking with no problem using blus and never really needed much more. That's just me though, it's what I enjoy. I don't see how this is any different from the highly popular juul that's been trending for over a year now. The juul has good flavors and it satisfies with 50mg of nicotine. The beauty of this industry is that it gives you the choice to vape absolutely any fuckin way you want. I've had provaris, high wattage devices, genesis atomizers, sub ohm tanks, drippers, you name it, it's all good stuff and it's still fun to try different things but I just don't require a whole lot to stay off cigarettes 
p713
aVGood stuff man, go with what works for you. I'm picking up a Juul for work simply so I can get my fix without refilling in the morning, making sure I have a separate stash of 12mg+ juice, etc. :)
p714
aVI'm very suprised nobody has mentioned an Icare. Any of them. They are inexpensive to buy and upkeep. The only downside is the battery but if she only uses it as a cig replacement she should be fine. Personally I use the solo for when I'm at work. The clouds are small enough to where people don't really notice or care. I would use a 6 or 9 MG. Depending on how many she smokes a day. 3 just doesn't give much or any nic for me. Gives better flavor than the juul and has more flavor options because it uses standard juice. 
p715
aVI'm not familiar with the Juno (or JUUL?) so I can't compare. The MTL hit is pretty loose out of the box because the intake isn't adjustable. I've hacked it by placing a piece of tape over the intake and poking a small hole to get that MTL restriction I'm use to from Stinkies. The unit itself is very sold, the body is aluminum and the tank is a tough plastic and the tanks are cheap, less than $3 each so I bought 3 extra tanks, each with 8.8ml of juice.
p716
aVHere's a good starter for you. http://www.vaporbeast.com/joyetech-atopack-penguin.html\u000a\u000aCheck out rip trippers on youtube. He's does a good job reviewing new devices.\u000a\u000aAnother good starter vape that's hits more like a cig is the juul. It's a pod system there are several others out like it now. \u000a\u000aIf you find something you like don't be afraid to ask. I'll help the best I can.
p717
aVMe and my wife got off smoking with cigalikes. We went with Greensmoke, but they have gone downhill since 2013. (Over charging for cartridges, and poor quality control with battery's) Juul seems to be the most recommended now, and they offer stronger nicotine compared to others. 
p718
aVYou looking to vape to kick cigs or do you want to get involved in the vape community ?\u000aBecause if you want to quit then juul will be good for you as it uses pods. If not use the smok V8 stick it comes with a big baby beast which puts out big clouds and you can upgrade when needed. 
p719
aVI would suggest getting a quick cigalike (juul, phix, cync, myjet, icare) with 25-50mg salt NIC juices.\u000a\u000aHits the cravings dead on when your really wanting to pick up a cancer stick
p720
aVTry the juul with the pods they are meant to be good for quitting then make your way up to more advanced set ups as you feel more comfortable and confident. Good luck, remember not to kick your self when you have a cig as as long as you're making progress it's working.
p721
aVIf you smoke get the Juul. If not then dont use nicotine imo, its pretty stupid and the buzz sucks ass. If you do use nicotine and dont smoke get 4-2mg. For a vape if you want to be conservative and get good flavour get the Spirals tank with a single 18650 battery mod, or just get the G80 kit as it comes with both. If you want clouds or dont care about efficency then get something like the Alien or Predator kits, i.e a dual or more battery mod with a high wattage tank.   Over a short time a tolerance to the amount of nic you use will develope and you will need more and more to get that buzz, or you will just get very neaseous trying to go that far. Nicotine in the freebase form like vaping is mainly believed to be as addictive as caffeine but the act of vaping and juices, ect. will really cause an addiction. I wouldnt do it if you never smoked period and at the least without nicotine if you do.
p722
aVIf you're looking to quit smoking, I highly recommend the Juul. It's a small  device that uses disposable pods. Really low maintenance and costs around $50 for a starter kit
p723
aVIf you want something small, convenient, doesn't weigh much, and a "pack" of cigarettes last you a day, the Juul.\u000a\u000aIf you want to seriously commit and make a large move, you can pick up actual mod kits that are nice to move on from smoking. I had the Juul and didn't like it personally. I had to buy the Alien starter kit to really get on with my life... 6 months off though. \u000a\u000aIt's worth stopping by getting a bigger one... Or even a Vaporesso Target Mini would be good for you. Small, convenient, and easy to work with. Good learners device too.
p724
aVLooks pretty similar to the Juul which I have, have you heard of it?
p725
aVyou should look up Mr Salt E to refill your pods it will save you tons and has a similar affect of a juul pod
p726
aVI got fruit+menthol and want to try a new flavor, do you also not get as much of a buzz from mr sale e juice then you do with regular juul pods?
p727
aVCheck out the juul by pax. If you don't want that much nicotine, you can also check out the myjet. 
p728
aVAnything that works to help you not smoke is the right setup.\u000aDoesnt matter if its a juul a 900 dollar stab wood mtl or a rx300 with a tfv12. 
p729
aVvape only malle, my von erl, juul, eleaf icare, Smoking vapor mi-one, all simple easy to sue stuff to get off smoking
p730
aVI would recommend a kangertech TOGO kit honestly. They are very easy to maintain and allow MTL hits with the higher ohm coils. \u000aA lot of people suggest the JUUL as well. It isn't a bad place to start but I would say skip straight to the TOGO. \u000a\u000aAs for juice you may need a higher amount of nicotine depending on how much they smoke daily and which coil for the TOGO you would use. 
p731
aVRDTAs can always leak. RDAs will leak if you overdrip and tilt. \u000a\u000aHonestly what I do, is when I take my "home" mod out of the house (instead of using my TOGO Mini or Juul), I bring a prebuilt tank. \u000a\u000aThe ones I use are Uwell D1 w/ 0.8 coils for crazy good flavor with subdued clouds, or the Melo 300 for big clouds (though the flavor does keep up really damn well). I also have a Crown III but not sure where it fits in here - thoroughly enjoying it though.\u000a\u000aIf you are looking for a tank that is really leak-proof, check out the Uwell D1. One of my all time favorites. It simply will not leak on you, and the 0.8 coils make everything delicious. :)
p732
aVTry looking into a JUUL by PAX. A lot of people use that to transition from smoking to vaping for a number of reasons. 1. It's very simple. You put the pod in, and you draw. That's it. When the pod is empty, you pull it out, and put a new one in. 2. It uses nicotine salts, opposed to freebase nicotine, which simulates a cigarette a lot better than most vapes. It also absorbs better, which will help kill those quick cravings. 3. It's relatively inexpensive. Hope this helps, and I wish the best of luck. 
p733
aVSo cigarettes have a bunch of added chemicals in them to increase absorption of nicotine. That's a big part of what makes them so bad for you. If you want something that's like a cigarette maybe try the juul, they added some sort of acid to the eliquid they use to make it more like a cigarette.
p734
aVThey sort of use nicotine salts but they add in benzoic acid to facilitate the conversion of nic salts to freebase because FREEBASE BREAKS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER FASTER. I am so sick of people propogating the myth that nic salts hit harder than freebase. It is scientifically proven to be false. The reason the juul hits hard is that it's FIFTY NINE milligram and they add benzoic acid to ensure uptake. I have nic salts and nic freebase that I use in diy and the freebase at 6 mg hits waaaay harder than the salts. The only benefit to salts is that they are smoother on throat hit. Sorry for the rant but I'm so tired of fighting misinformation on this matter. People hear the myth that "salts hit like a truck" and just swallow it whole without looking at all the SCIENTIFIC STUDIES that PROVE freebase is absorbed more readily than salts. That's why crack cocaine hits harder than cocaine hcl, and why it is so much more addictive.
p735
aVThis is the internet mate I have no other outlets and I will lecture when I want to. I wasn't so much directing it at you as I was trying to avoid the op reading your comment and thinking that nic salts are the reason that the juul hits like a cigarette. Cause they're not.
p736
aVGo to YouTube and do searches on the following aio units and see if one of these will satisfy your needs; Penguin AIO, Icare, Icare Mini, Juul, My Von Erl, Vertx Plus. These are all small units typically under $35, some are only $25. They're all rechargeable and most refillable. I've ordered the Icare Mini for my in the car use or temping out for a few hours. It comes with a charger and it's a small enough charger that I can put that in my pocket and use the charger as a spare battery as well if the main unit dies. It was only $25 with the charger. There is also a slightly larger Icare but it doesn't have the charger, just a USB cable so that may be good enough since it's a bigger battery than the mini. Good luck.
p737
aVWhy would you recommend a mech?\u000a\u000a\u000aHe's probably looking for a simpe regulated set up, maybe a juul, or smok stick, or joyetech ego AIO. or maybe something like a mi-one?
p738
aVJuul or Phix?
p739
aVI didn't like any of the Phix flavors. While I do like three of the JUUL flavors.
p740
aVjuul
p741
aVhow did you take the juno apart? im trying to get into the main battery compartment. Is it similar to the juul?
p742
aVI am new to vaping and am not familiar with the Juul. Here is a copy/paste from another reply. Sorry for the late reply.\u000a\u000a &gt; To disassemble the Juno, you are going to need a couple of things: 1) An eyeglass (extremely small) flat head screwdriver, or a pick that comes with an electronics repair tool kit, or a small pick. 2) A willingness to face the abyss of regret and embarrassment that has become your life. 3) A soldering iron and some flux core solder. First take out your Juno pod. Next, look at the bottom of the Juno where the mini usb port is. On the both sides of the battery casing, the short sides of the rectangle case, there are two small holes. These are where the plastic of the battery clip into the metal case. Once you've found these, reminisce about that dumb fucking thing you did that one time that made you that guy to that group of people. Now grab whatever version of a small metal yet sturdy thing you have as a tool and press into the hole at an upward angle, then while applying pressure try to get the plastic to unclip from the case on that side by pushing in and away from where the pods insert. So, into the small hole, like the hole where your belief that you would fall in love used to be, with the tool, push in and then down, like you push down the anger that you were not aborted, towards the mini usb port. (After a couple of times doing this, the plastic clips have disintegrated, but being able to pull the plastic battery and circuit board out makes it easier to clean.) Do the same on the other side. After alternating sides you should be able to get the plastic clips free to pull out of the metal case.\u000aOnce you do this, you have a battery, circuit board, or whatever the green part is, and the pins. You will see that the pins are soldered to the circuit board, the circuit board and battery is glued to the plastic, and the battery is wired to the mini usb port. The plastic casing around the area of the usb port comes off.\u000aI just dropped flux core solder onto the pins because I did not have access to replacement parts if I really fucked something up, you know...like my life, and fixed the problem as it was, the battery being able to make contact with the coil to vaporize the liquid in the pod. A smarter person i.e. anybody, may be able to rig something up a different way.
p743
aVLet my batterys die, now I'm on my juul and can only blow *sickly* cirrus clouds :(
p744
aVJust bought first vape (juul) couple questions
p745
aVIt's both. The Juul won't really be something you can use to get crazy clouds as it's a smaller less powerful device that uses higher nicotine strength to compensate. The reason more powerful devices use lower nicotine is because the amount of vapor that's produced is much much higher. The ejuice affects it but not as quite as much as the device itself. The Juul is a great vape but tbh if you're looking to chuck clouds it really isn't the device you want. 
p746
aVIf you're looking for something similar but better to the Juul, check out the eleaf icare 
p747
aVYou can bend out the prongs of the pod just a hair to get a better connection to the battery, gives a little bit better hit.  I started with the juul back in January 2016, have been cigarette free since my first hit of the juul, even though I have much more powerful devices and atomizers, the juul goes EVERYWHERE with me.  Love that little thing.
p748
aVThis is what worked to get my wife to quite cigs.\u000aGet a juul starter kit for your nicotine cravings. This will take care of the actual physical nic cravings after 2-4 puffs. Depends on how heavy a smoker you are. If youre still craving its in your head.\u000aAlso realize, that you ARE GOING TO COUGH for around 4-6 weeks.\u000aIf you will make up your mind to get through that, then the rest is cake.\u000aYou can pick up a subohm tank with low or no nicotine to cover the hand to mouth aspect.\u000aThe juul with its high nicotine pods is really the key to it.
p749
aVYou should look into the Juul and the Bo One. Everyone speaks very highly about the Juul, but it was impossible for me to find in Canada. I personally have a Bo One with the PCC, and can verify that it is a fantastic device. \u000a\u000awww.juulvapor.com\u000awww.bovaping.com\u000a\u000a
p750
aVI do not like the suggestions you have gotten so far. I think the best mod to start with is an Icare solo, with Mr. Salt-eliquid at 45 mg or a juul. I would go with the Icare solo if I were you. I have several and they are quite good, as they allow for small, mouth to lung hits, but have enough airflow that you can inhale directly to lung if you choose. The juul I have never used, but you can't reduce nicotine content of juice with the juul. The Icare solo is also dirt cheap, as are coils for it. Someone else recommended the myjet. I think that is a bad option. The pods are difficult to fill and especially difficult to refill, and you can only get tiny, unsatisfying hits from it (despite the fact that it tastes amazing). Someone else recommended a Battlestar or something. Don't get that for your mother for her first vape, that's an idiotic suggestion. It has way too many features and it's too big and clunky for a beginner who just wants to stop smoking, it's definitely a hobbyist mod. \u000a\u000aPlease trust me and get the Icare solo. You won't regret it. It's like 12 dollars, and if she likes that ok then maybe think about upgrading to a more expensive settup.
p751
aVMaybe you would enjoy a Juul or an iCare for work. They are supersmall and give a huge nicotine hit without much vapor. Very much like a cigarette.
p752
aVThe Juul will definitely make you feel like you are smoking.\u000aThe Juul cartridges are ejuice with 50mg/ml nicotine (yes, really that much).\u000a\u000aThey work great as cigarette replacements.\u000a\u000aMaybe you can try one somewhere before buying, they are really expensive.\u000a\u000aIf you want the clouds though, I probably would use an OBS engine tank. They are totally leak proof because of the top airflow and can carry huge coils. You must buot your own coils though. 
p753
aV[QUESTION] Is the Juul unhealthy?
p754
aVSo just say i vape at 25 watts using 3mg nic, is this similar to vaping the Juul? I just can't see how getting a buzz from something so fast isn't unhealthy. I don't know if this is a real concern?
p755
aVNot even close. You're using a very low-nic setup. But it's all about how much you need to be satisfied. If you have to vape that 3mg all day to be satisfied, the juul might be helpful. If you take ten puffs and are set for a bit then a couple puffs will be more than enough. \u000a\u000aYou have to realize nicotine delivery is different for every product and you can't simply look at MG level, you have to look at everything surrounding it. 
p756
aVso what's the deal with the juul? is it worse than normal vaping?
p757
aVso what is the difference between normal vaping and using the juul, is that high nicotine really dangerous?
p758
aV3mg from a normal mod produces a lot of vapour which means you're\u200b inhaling more nicotine each time you take a hit.  \u000a   \u000a50mg from a juul produces a small amount of vapour, this means that the nicotine content has to be higher to reach a similar level.
p759
aVSo if u took like a super long hit from the juul vs a super long hit from a normal vape, the juul would be more unhealthy? 
p760
aVVuse Vibe vs Juul
p761
aVSneaky juul photobombing. Hahaha.\u000a\u000aI assume that's an auto return switch?
p762
aVJuul - ez pz pods
p763
aVI would say a phix or a juul but they both take pods\u000aTry the emili vape kit it is what I started with it works great there is an option to choose a button or non button 
p764
aVWho told you it has any relation whatsoever to the Juul?

aVHere's what I did in the first 2 weeks I started:\u000aI used to smoke 2 packs of Marlboro lights a day so when I started vaping I was smoking at the same time, BUT, what I was doing is this. I used to light to the cigarette, take a drag, but I wouldn't inhale the smoke. That left a very bad taste in my mouth and with every cigarette I lighted and didn't inhale, I thought twice about the next one when I wanted it because the taste was disgusting. Out of 1 cigarette, I used to inhale maybe 1 or 2 puffs, BUT I would inhale it in the middle of the cigarette so when I get to the end I still have that nasty taste... You'd be surprised out disgusting the taste of cigarettes is when you don't inhale it. That's how I was able to transition into vaping.\u000a\u000aNow, if you have high nicotine cravings, id recommend starting with the Juul only for on reason. That little thing has 50% nicotine in 1 pod (to whoever wants to challenge me on this, FACT CHECK ME). If the Juul is not an option to you, id recommend starting with 18mg nicotine e-juices and slowly lower the dosage.\u000a\u000aHope it helps and if you have any questions feel free to msg me or reply here.
p766
aVNo. Not really. I kept one mod and two tanks. But since I started using the Juul, I feel like I do not need anything else. I refill my pods, throw it in the pocket and am good for the day. I don't have to worry about leaking. Or producing huge clouds that might piss someone off. I love this damn thing so much I own three. 
p767
aVThe juul is fantastic on a rainy day! Any of you guys have the juul?
p768
aVIn my opinion the juul is for teenagers.
p769
aVJuul or My Von Erl?
p770
aVHaha. Seriously though. I wanted a Juul but as I'm in Europe there was no point in forcing the issue. So I got myself a 'Bo' one and I'm happy with it. Some have said that it's the closest contender to the Juul. The nic percentage in no way near that of what you are used to with that device, however. But I'm a bit of a chain smoker so 16mg is plenty for me. Plus, refilling pods is pretty simple. As for menthol flavored e-juices, I don't like them so I can't comment on that. 
p771
aVYeah man the Juul is a solid device. Probably just going to stick with it.
p772
aVWhy not the MyJet? I like it much better than the Juul and the Von Erl. It's almost identical to the Von Erl in performance but the Von Erl has a slight delay when inhaling to activate which is annoying (to me). The negative to the MyJet is the proprietary charger, but you're used to that with the Juul. 
p773
aVMost powerful (watts) cig-a-like vape pod style?? JUUL, My Von Erl, Myjet, etc...
p774
aVUnfortunately too big, needs to be similar style to the ones listed above like the JUUL. I understand that none of them will have a lot of power by I'm still just trying to find the most "powerful" of them 
p775
aVJuul affecting my athleticism
p776
aVJUUL... simply the best little vape out there, instant nic satisfaction, stealth vapeable almost anywhere
p777
aVYou want a stealth mod or a regular mod? I also like my al85 with serpent mini RTA, but that's not a tenth as stealthy as one of my Icare solos. Throw some 50 mg juice in and you've  got stealth and nic hit. I also didn't say that the solo was the best, I just like mine. I like it waaaaay more than my myjet, despite the fact that the myjet has way better flavor. I also like it way more than my og icare, which had terrible spitback issues. I haven't tried the juul, but it is far more expensive and isn't made to take aftermarket juice, and I found the pod style of the myjet to be a pain in my ass, so I wouldn't drop double the money on the juul. The solo cost me literally 12 dollars too, so it's a damn bargain. Plus coils are like 3$ and some change for a 5 pack on fasttech. Don't be so quick to dismiss the solo, it just depends on if you want a stealth mod or a slightly more pocket friendly mod than the 2-4 battery mods with smok tanks that everybody seems to be into these days. 
p778
aVThe wismec my jet is discreet like the Juul but designed to be refillable (not just hackable). 
p779
aVCan always go with a pod system like limitless pulse, juul or von erl. Or something like the mi-one.
p780
aVIs the juul any good?
p781
aVWhy would the Juul be worse for you? Surely you only vape until your nic level is satisfied. \u000a\u000aIf anything, the other option would be worse because you have to use more juice to get the same nicotine. 
p782
aVFor someone looking to simply quit smoking, I would suggest devices like the Juul, Limitless Pulse, or even the iCare system or something along those lines. They're primarily draw activated, no buttons to push no adjustments to be made, just stick it on a charger, when it's done stick a flavor pod in or your preferred juice and just enjoy as needed. Plus they're a more wallet friendly alternative to picking up a couple cigarette packs on the regular. One mistake I've noticed a lot of local shops do is suggest a box mod and a crazy tank full of buttons and lights to people who come in for a simple alternative to cigarettes, it can be very intimidating and turn most people off of the entire idea. Sure it's become a hobby for some like myself but others just want to quit smoking for good. \u000a\u000aDefinitely consider looking online for affordable devices though, I'd suggest Element Vape as a starter if you're considering looking at the products I mentioned. I also wish you luck in quitting the cigarettes! You got this! 
p783
aVWell the fetish thing is weird bro, but what helped me was the JUUL because it felt like smoking a cigarette.  Haven't had a cigarette since Jan 2016, since the first time I took the JUUL off the charger.  I have all kinds of vape gear now, but I really thank that little bitty vape for me actually quitting smoking and staying quit.
p784
aVHow's the bo? I've been wanting a little mouth to lung and can't decide. I've been leaning towards the Juul. 
p785
aVCan't really say anything about the Juul as I've never tried it, but the bo is brilliant to grab for when you're out and about or just want something that isn't all clouds and direct lung! \u000a\u000aFlavours available are great and it charges in no time. 
p786
aVOTHERWISE GET THE JUUL THE LIQUA ONE IS TRASH
p787
aVWHY ARE YOU SCREAMING? AND WHY THE LIQUA ONE IS TRASH? I CANT BUY JUUL IN MY COUNTRY.
p788
aVHey now, Juul was the only thing that got me to quit smoking instantly... still carry it with me everywhere, along side my mod.  One juul pod lasts me like a week now though because I only use it for super discrete vaping
p789
aVJesus christ!\u000a\u000aJust buy a Juul and be done with it 
p790
aVI like that they're marketed as refillable and are not just hacked to be refilled luke the Juul and shit. 
p791
aVI got one as soon as I could. Love the futuristic/sci-fi looks and couldn't wait for the release date. When I finally got it I was pretty disappointed. I think part of my problem was my juice, as well as wanting it to equal the Juul with mint pods. After fiddling with the pods, rebuilding,  rewicking, etc. I ordered some more pods and other flavors of salt juices. I've been using it solely for the past couple days though, while waiting for the new pods, and have been enjoying it.
p792
aVAnyone know the wattage of a juul?
p793
aVThe pods more or less expensive than juul?
p794
aVJuul competitors?
p795
aVThe Bo One is really good and almost exactly like a Juul. The draw is very tight on it, much like a cigarette. It also has an optional 1500 may PCC that is really nice and will charge your ecig for up to 5 days. \u000a\u000abovaping.com\u000a\u000ahttps://youtu.be/Tir7ZhG8FSM
p796
aVThey're obviously talking about little bitty vapes, like a juul which lasts almost a day... or those god awful Blu exits... but I have nothing else that can last that long...
p797
aVBlu is terrible, as are most all gas station cig-a-likes... EXCEPT for the JUUL... it's freaking amazing!!!!
p798
aVJuul is made by Pax, the herbal vaporizer people.  Try it, you will love it... so discrete, so fulfilling.
p799
aVJuul? Never used it but people seem to love it. Only downside people always mention is the expensive refills.\u000a\u000aThe Vaporshark Minnow also looks good and would probably be a bit cheaper in the long run by replacing coils and refilling it with a good juice (nic salts are popular in these things - dr salt e)
p800
aVJuul, perfect for a smoker trying to quit.  Has the same draw as a cigarette, no steep learning curve, feels like smoking a cigarette.  I was a pack and a half a day smoker for over 15yrs, and I quit instantly with the Juul in January 2016.  Haven't had a cigarette since.  I have much expanded my vape collection since, but the Juul is definitely one of the best ways to start.
p801
aVJuice similar to that of a juul but for a box?
p802
aVYou'd probably have better success with a pod system like the juul, but that tank is a pretty good one to start with. Look into the aspire nautilus as well.
p803
aVIt's not nearly as bad for your lungs as smoking. I haven't noticed any negative effects, and I also don't get colds or bronchitis all the time like I did when I smoked a pack a day. If you do want to try vaping, I'd recommend something like the Juul. The higher nic is good for satisfying cravings, plus they're small and easy to use.
p804
aVEleafs are popular here on reddit but I have no personal experience with them. I have had a Juul, which is similar, in my opinion would works great. It's limited on their cartridges for flavors, but I think it would be good for you, being you'd not need it that often. \u000aMe personally now, I still use it to get my nicotine fix, however I have several mods and tanks and such because now it's sort of like a hobby for me. I've been getting into building coils, which is my favorite pass time when I don't play my Xbox. It might become something you might try, and might get good enough to start selling your own on reddit, like I hope I will be able to. (:

aVSeconding (thirding?) the Juul or iCare. Small, easy, less vapor to mess up your windows.
p808
aVYeah I vape like I smoked cigs. Went from like 7 years of marbs to about 8 months with juul. Got sick of dud pods and was spending over 120 a month on pods for the thing. Loved it but the constant defects and 0 response from customer support drove me to buy a real mod... thingy....\u000aI'm vaping now and the flavor is better.\u000aEdit: using the old juices I liked
p809
aVThe Juul is pretty discrete. I've been seeing folks with them a lot around Charlotte, especially in the vape shops I frequent. \u000aLink: https://www.juulvapor.com/\u000aHappy Vaping!
p810
aVJuul. They can be expensive if you vape constantly, but they're a little bigger than a thumb drive, they produce little vapor, and hey contain lots of nicotine that works very fast, because they use nicotine salts rather than freebase nicotine.

p812
aVHappened to THREE buddies of mine, now half the squad only uses Juul. 
p813
aVJuuls are pretty expensive. If i were to use a cheap vape it'd be an icare. Juuls are like an upwards to 50 bucks with cartridges, thats only 10 bucks away from a new rx200, and even after that a cleto is like 20 bucks
p814
aVIt's a juul
p815
aVThat's the only real problem with them, IMO.  I have my nice full setup at home and even DIY my own juice which is cheap AF... but I love the portability and ease of use of the Juul.  (and the fact that it's actually an enjoyable experience to use).... so I 'm wasting money buying pods when I really don't need to.\u000a\u000aWhatever though...as long as I'm not smoking.

aVRanges $16-24 per pack of four pods depending on the area. Not hating on juuls but if you want something similar buy an iCare and purchase some mr salts e juice. It's the same formula of nicotine juul uses to achieve the very fast hard hitting buzz. Much cheaper in the long run...

p832
aVWrote a long comment, hope that at least one person reads it.\u000a\u000a&gt;First of all, vape devices use the same 18650 battery cell as laptops. Are you afraid of your precious MacBook exploding? Most of the incidents that you cherry-picked in this video happened mostly because of poor battery safety - shorting them by just throwing them in your pockets with keys and other conductive stuff, or using an unregulated device without any knowledge. If you use a good Samsung or LG cell, in a regulated (95% of the market) device and keep your spare batteries in a plastic case, you are safe. \u000a\u000a2) using Juul as the benchmark to all vapes is like using Renault Clio as a benchmark to all cars. \u000a\u000a3) FDA is a corrupt institution with a heavy lobby from both pharma and tobacco businesses to keep their very, very threatening competition, vaping, less relevant or even banned. I have much more trust in British government and NHS than I do in FDA.\u000a\u000a 4) "Cigarettes are a really low bar for 'healthy'". Anything that gets people off cigarettes is much better than smoking, and e-cigarettes are tools for quitting first.\u000a\u000a 5) Cool or not cool, that should not be a factor for an adult - leave caring what other people think of you in high school. Each smoker that doesn't switch to vaping because of this stigma is a person who has died of a preventable disease just because publications like you told him that it's 'uncool'. Overall, you didn't even present a single good point with reputable evidence on why vaping is dangerous or harmful, and I hope that nobody takes this video seriously.\ufeff
p833
aVThis. The juul is an excellent product for beginners, cheap, and seriously curbs cigarette cravings.
p834
aVOn the flip side JUUL got me quit for good after several mods eventually failed. Still hang on to my box mod for when I feel like vaping my face off because the JUUL is too harsh for that type of use. 
p835
aVHi OP...  I was a smoker for almost 31-years and totally quit tobacco 2-years ago via vaping.  When I was contemplating  making the switch, I was in exactly the same place you are.  \u000a\u000aFor what it's worth... after reading your post, here is what I would recommend:  \u000a\u000a*  Read.  Do some Google searches and read what you can about vaping to get your base of knowledge increased.  (I thought vaping was a "thing" for kids before I started!)  \u000a*  Research the following devices:  Juul, iCare, and myJet.  All three are small, relatively inexpensive, self-contained devices that will let you experience vaping with little fuss and minimal investment.  \u000a*  Once you decide on which device, order several different flavors of e-juice so you can experiment on which you like best.  Don't shy away from menthol or mint in the beginning.  All our palates are different, and you may find the "ticket" to keep you off cigarettes with a flavor you least expect to like.  \u000a\u000aThere can be a huge learning curve with the vast array of vaping devices on the market.  Don't let it overwhelm you in the beginning.  Just get a simple, easy to use device like the ones listed above and give it a try to see if you like it.  If you do like it, newer and better devices will follow.  \u000a\u000aFor what it's worth, I was hugely skeptical before I made the switch.  Like you, I had tried everything... and I mean everything to quit smoking.  But once I took my first vape hit from the beginner device I purchased 2-years ago... BAM...  I knew I could quit smoking via this technology.  \u000a\u000aI've since upgraded my devices 3-4 times, but the sensation remains... DAMN, this is SO much better than smoking!    \u000a\u000aGOOD LUCK!!!  
p836
aVJUUL users. It's such a small amount of vapor that the 50ml doesn't burn your throart. It's supposed to mimic a cigarette. It's also not meant for chain vaping.
p837
aVI'm a lurker former smoker. The Juul did it for me and I passed it along to a friend who also quit because of it. I have since gotten into the icare line and I love it. Wish you the best. It's an amazing feeling not having your hands smell like cigarettes and feel like your stuck. You will feel the difference in as little as a week vaping. 
p838
aVIt's 50mg, but it's made using a "nicotine salt", which is different from the free-base nicotine contained in most e-liquids.  It's meant for lower-powered MTL devices like the Juul or the iCare, and yes, the concentration is higher as well.\u000a\u000aIt allows for much better flavor without the harshness you usually get from higher nic juices.\u000a\u000aBut comparing the mg or % of nicotine in nic salt e-liquid to traditional e-liquid is a bit like comparing apples and oranges, it isn't a linear match.
p839
aVAnother vote here for the Juul, excellent place to start.\u000a\u000aMeets your needs as described above, and compared to most smaller "ciga-like" devices it's actually enjoyable to use and comparable to the "real thing".\u000a\u000aIt's a bit on the pricey side as far as Vape stuff goes, but it's still cheaper than real cigs, and once you've used the Juul for a while and comfortable with vaping (and NOT smoking), it will be much easier for you to branch out to other types of e-cigs that are cheaper to maintain on a daily basis.
p840
aVWas just about to comment on this. I owned a juul myself and I think you will be very happy with how easy it is to use.
p841
aVPretty much anything I have to say on the subject of where you should start has been said in the 40 other comments on here, but I just want to add another vote to the Juul/MyJet pool. I favor the MyJet personally because you can fill the pods with whatever juice you want (whereas the Juul is pre-filled) but since you said you'd be looking for something pre-filled, the Juul might be a better way for you to go. They're both pretty similar in other regards, very compact, tight draw, and juices like Fill My Pod (which are made for devices like the MyJet) carry a high enough nicotine content that it's still tremendously satisfying.\u000a\u000aOn the subject of quitting: there are a lot of people who were able to make the switch from cigarettes to vaping pretty much immediately. I wasn't one of those people, and most of my friends weren't either (with the exception of myself and one of my friends, everyone eventually quit smoking using the MyJet, so take that as another vote of confidence). In my personal opinion, part of the reason why vaping has been so effective in smoking cessation is because it handles more than just the physical addiction to nicotine: it also helps us overcome the mental addiction too. It takes care of the oral fixation and it's very enjoyable (as long as you're using a setup that satisfies your needs, whatever they may be). Other smoking cessation products on the market, like the patch or Chantix, can't do what vaping does. So that's a big plus.\u000a\u000aBut it's not a cigarette--you don't pull your pack out of your pocket and pull the cigarette out, hold it in your mouth and light it with your trusty Bic, it doesn't have the same smell or the same taste. Everyone is different when they quit smoking, but for me, these are STILL the things I miss the most about cigarettes and I STILL have the urge to smoke sometimes when I'm around it, and I've gone over a year without them. So if you're like me, you might have to find other ways aside from vaping to help you quit smoking. Cardio has actually helped me a lot, because it forces me to notice the fact that I don't have as much trouble breathing as I used to. So just keep that in mind. Be gentle with yourself, but firm. Keep track of the days you've gone without a cigarette, and be proud of it. Only smokers know how hard quitting smoking really is, and from one (ex) smoker to another (hopefully soon to be ex) smoker, best of luck!

aVPhix by Mlv is closed loop system similar to juul but i heard really good things about it so i decided to test it out let me know if any of you guys are familiar with this device if so let me know what you think of it !
p848
aVThere's going to be a ton of devices that will be releasing soon so you shouldn't worry about it.  What's current on the market are:\u000aJuul\u000aMyjet\u000aVon Erl\u000aPhix\u000aBo\u000aFITT\u000aThese are your options, my preference would be Juul, Myjets &amp; Von Erl.  I find these pretty easy to use, and delivery for all is great!  Von Erl &amp; Myjet is cost friendly so you don't have to spend much.  More money you save on a device so you can spend it on the liquid!  Research them to see which would best fit you. Spend sometime researching on liquid tho, I would definitely look into something with Nicotine Salt because it goes best with these devices.
p849
aVI personally use the Juul and Myjet.\u000aThe Juul is small, convenient, and their nicotine delivery/satisfaction is great. I like the MyJet because the pods are readily available and I find them easy to fill with my favorite nic salt liquid.\u000aBut I have tried a lot of different devices.\u000aI had an icare but wasn't a huge fan because of spit back. \u000aThe Bo is a nice device but pods are hard to come by.\u000aVon Erl pods are a pain to rebuild and their standard flavors a not good in my opinion.\u000aThe Fitt by Envii is pretty solid. I think it holds the most liquid per pod and the pods were easy to refill, I haven't tried rebuilding one yet though.\u000aGood luck on your search  \u000a \u000a\u000a

aVThere are also tiny devices such as the Juul and MyJet which you can't beat if you want a cigarette-like experience. So have a look at those as well.
p862
aVDoes that feel pretty similar to a juul?
p863
aVMy roommate has a Juul. The airflow is not as tight as the Juul's (haven't messed with my devices air flow control, its always been with all air flow holes open). I tried it before getting the iCare. I like the iCare's versatility. However, the Juul has a better throat hit due to the tighter draw. I haven't tried an awful lot of juices on my iCare, but the Juul's Creme Brulee is just awesome!
p864
aVJuul!
p865
aVHey! \u000a\u000aI use the juul myself. I love it because the throat hit it give you feels just like a real cigarette and it does not produce too much vapor. \u000a\u000aUnfortunately 5% is the highest level for Juul.  5% nicotine breaks down to 50mg per fluid ounce. Juul actually has the strongest nicotine level in the market right now unless you feel like mixing your own juul pods(its hard, i tried..lol).  Also most ejuice lines that are sold in bottles cap off at 12mg(1.2%) or 18mg(1.8%) now.
p866
aVYeah when I first got my Juul, i was running through atleast one pod a day. Not many people tell you this when they sell it to you but 5 drags off of a juul is the nicotine equivalent to one cigarette. If you keep that in mind, that may help you taper down. It helped me. Cause most of the time I just hit the juul for the act of smoking 
p867
aVHand check. JUUL vape w mint pod.
p868
aVAccidents happen. Some dogs suck. Its not like her kids got into your purse, which would be their bad (depending on age of course) Personally I would be honest. There is a lot f misinformation about vaping and I wouldn't want my boss to have bad info on something I do. I would make some tea or coffee and sit down and apologize, explain its a Juul, a vaporizer, and offer to openly answer any questions she might have about vaping. 
p869
aVHow do I make juul pods last longer?
p870
aVWhat do you think of the juul?
p871
aVI love my Juul, the mint flavor is sooooooo satisfying.  I quit smoking instantly January 2016 with the juul, and graduated to bigger and better things, but the Juul still goes everywhere with me.
p872
aVYeah the flavor on the juul is subpar... except for mint it is exceptional. Not a lot of flavor, not too much mint, closest thing to a smoke I think I've ever had.
p873
aVThoughts on the juul?
p874
aVI hit a juul and I thought my larynx was going to explode.  Throat hit is massive.
p875
aVTry the Myjet. Works just like the juul but you can refill the pods yourself. 
p876
aVJuul alternative juice?
p877
aVBuy a Juul. 50mg e-liquids sold in four-packs of 2.5mL pods (cartridges). Mint flavor is A1.
p878
aVBought the JUUL and love it!!
p879
aVJust wanted to report back for anyone who finds this in the future.\u000a\u000aI bought a JUUL and it's great.  Does exactly what I asked for in the original post.\u000a\u000aI want to be open minded to new flavors,  and while I've gone as far as disassembling and rebuilding coils in a ProTank 3 (most people would call this too much of a PITA to justify), I'm not going to try and recoil a JUUL cart, and it's impossible to buy new ones, so\u000a\u000aI've purchased an eLeaf iCare and 2 bottles of 45mg Mr. Salt-e\u000a\u000aCustomer service for Mr. Salt-E was good, but the price is pretty steep.  (likely because it's one of the only nic salt products on the market)\u000a\u000aI will report back on how the iCare goes!
p880
aVI mean, there are a few all in one devices that are virtually leak proof. Everything you need comes in the box, but you still need to buy liquid. The ego AiO box comes to mind, it literally could not be easier to use and is actually fairly easy on the juice so you don't refill often.\u000a\u000aOther than that I've seen some devices that come with flavor pods you just put in but they are mostly shit and seem over priced. \u000a\u000aActually there is the juul, I think it uses pods of some kind? I'm not sure on that one. It's also an AIO style device and quite small and easy to use. 
p881
aVIt'll be more expensive in the long run (cost of replacement pods vs refilling) but you can't get much more "no-nonsense, it just works" than a Juul by Pax.
p882
aVI went to Disney world and took a Juul with me, enough nic to curb the craving, so little vapor that no one knew I was doing it.  I just vaped away throughout the entire park, just had to hold it in and exhale very slowly.
p883
aVDitched my mod for a Juul handcheck
p884
aVThey are nice if you can get the pods. The Myjet is designed just like the juul but you have the option of filling the pods yourself.
p885
aVPax juul pod
p886
aVDamn that all black icare looks the tits, I got the "green" or "cyan" or "Tiffany" colored one so I could ditch my Juul and those silly pods(gonna miss that Juul tho, the mint is sooooo good)
p887
aVI didn't get my parents to quit smoking but I originally got my girlfriend to quit smoking and start vaping by buying her a juul and now she has a limitless mech mod. She liked the "act" I guess of smoking a cigarette and the juul is the closet thing to an actual cigarette a vape can offer from what I know(don't take my word for that) but you should look it up and decided if it might help your parents. And goodluck to ya mate. 
p888
aVI have one word my friend. JUUL, it's the best ecig you can buy to quit cigs.
p889
aVIt's good! It is super tiny, so it's easy to stick in a pocket, and easy to hide in your hand if you're wanting to sneak a puff on campus/in class.  It is kinda noisy though, so that makes it a bit less stealthy.  Vapor production is good (but I'm not a cloud chaser, and only have a couple other mods to compare it to).\u000a\u000aI haven't used it exclusively yet, I have it as a different flavor along side my other mod...so I can't speak to how long the battery life is nor how long a juice fill will last.\u000a\u000aIt's incredibly easy to use, just draw and it vapes.  No buttons to push.  Without going to the Juul or a pen-style to get the cig shape, it is much closer to the experience of smoking a cig.  No buttons, just put it to your lips and draw, small and light, vapor production about the same as a cig.  It has a more restrictive air flow, so the draw is harder than say, my other mods, but is similar to pulling on a cig.
p890
aVLook up the "juul"\u000a\u000aThe guy in this video is pretty annoying, but he explains everything pretty well:\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NyXFxV6514
p891
aVThere's more too big clouds than being a fucking vape bro. We can help you get started here but you might want to work on your mindset a bit. I started with a setup similar to what I think you're looking for. I quickly found out that it wasn't enough of a throat hit to keep me off cigs. So I had to upgrade. That means bigger clouds. I'm really careful about where I vape in public for the same reasons you seem to be afraid of but at the end of the day I just laugh at anyone that gives me a hard time. Like sorry I found a healthier way to get my nicotine, would you rather me light up a tar stick? \u000a\u000aThat being said grab a couple juuls or an istick pico kit. Pm me if you have any questions. 
p892
aVThe iCare is kind of a cool device, but somewhat defeats the purpose of recreational vaping in my eyes. The iCare and several others (Juul, VonErl, etc.) were developed to deliver a highly concentrated nicotine salt solution to vapers who wanted to get a good hit without making big clouds (think movie theater or at work). The flavor won't be as good as other devices.\u000a\u000aI think that you would get more enjoyment out of something like a Kanger Subvod C or Aspire Pockex which will give better flavor and a bigger cloud, but not to the point of being obnoxious. These devices are meant for new vapers and fairly safe unless you do something really retarded with it. They will also provide a better battery life in my experience. 
p893
aVAny new juul flavors?
p894
aVI usually wake up in the night to take a leak, and I'll hit my juul a couple times before going back to sleep. When I wake for work at 4:30, I'll go downstairs and drink my tea, vape, check my news and social media, voop.
p895
aVI started with the Juul, the juul pods give a restrictive hit like a cigarette, and the nic content is through the roof such that a Juul pod = a pack of cigs and lasted about the same amount of time for me, about one a day maybe one and a half a day.  I then got a very basic mod and started at 18mg nic and worked my way down to 3mg over the course of a year.  But I will say this, I stopped smoking instantly with that Juul, from the moment I took it off the charger.  Good luck my friend.
p896
aVI wish the vape shop owners were a little more business savvy.  If customers like us see absurd markups, we walk out immediately with a bad taste in our mouth.  I doubt you expect to see your vape shop selling Naked for $15 to compete with online, but somewhere between $18 to $24 would be a lot more acceptable.\u000a\u000aI don't even go to local shops because I'm prejudiced their prices are going to be uncompetitive.  I bought some Juul pods at a vape shop without first asking the price. Turns out they were $19.99 per pack plus tax.  At a nearby gas station, I bought the same pods for less than $16, tax included.
p897
aVTo clarify, this type of juice was created for devices like the iCare, MyJet. Juul, etc where they use coils above 1 ohm. In those devices, the nic content has to much higher in order to have any real effect.

aVBuy a juul for those days when you just can't be bothered to build. Smack a pod in and done.

p901
aVWhen I started vaping it took me another year or so to quit cigarettes, and it kind of started by accident (I had a bad cold and was too sick to buy another pack, so by the time I felt better I decided to just keep it rolling). Some people can quit cold turkey as soon as they pick up vaping, but for me and for a lot of people I know it takes a lot of effort.\u000a\u000aIn my experience, when I quit, there's no wiggle room. It's an addiction and I have to treat it as such. I've never been a social smoker, and a backup pack of cigarettes would be gone in less than a day, then I'd be going out to get another...you get the point. I can't let myself have one every now and then. It's like flipping a switch in my head, as soon as I have one, I'm right back in the thick of it. It might be the same for you--when you feel that weakness coming on, you can't gave. Rely more on your vape, but also, pick up other things to keep yourself busy. The first time I quit was years ago and I did it without vaping so I'd just chew a ton of gum because I'd never want to smoke a cigarette if my mouth felt minty fresh. Things like that, you know?\u000a\u000aYour setup is important too. I've heard really good things about the Juul (took a couple pulls off a friend's and I was surprised at how much like a real cigarette it felt, but it's been close to a year since I've had the real deal). I'm also a big fan of the iCare. Both of these things have pulls more similar to a cigarette and can deliver more nicotine if needed. Plus they're small and very easy to transport. I'm not saying you HAVE to get a new setup, it's just something to consider.\u000a\u000aAs for dental health, it's hard to say. I'm sure it's probably not as bad as cigarettes, but that doesn't mean it's harmless. There are a decent amount of sweeteners in some e-juices that I'm sure aren't good for your teeth overall. You can try to offset it by making sure you're flossing regularly and brushing your teeth at least twice a day. But also, keep in mind that you don't have to vape forever either. You can use it to quit smoking and then work on quitting vaping. There are no longterm studies that I'm aware of. Vaping is still a very new industry that's only gained momentum in the last few years, so it's going to be a while before anything like that comes out.

aVJuul
p903
aVI canceled a big order for my Juul...and I received it anyways.
p904
aVI started vaping with a sub-ohm setup and quit smoking by way of using juice at 3mg nic. A few months ago I got a Juul and honestly barely touch my sub-ohm these days. Juul for life
p905
aVHow is the Juul? My friend wants to get one to quit cigs but apparently they only have super strong (15) nic 
p906
aVOh no, so I've been vaping for a couple years now. Got a few regulated mods and drippers and RTAs. Honestly, I like the discreet factor of the Juul. It truly is "stealth vaping."\u000a\u000aI'd rather not be blowing clouds when I'm out, you know? 
p907
aVI've been vaping since the summer of 2015 and have a few box mods, drippers, RTAs, all that. I even DIY my own juice.\u000a\u000aHowever, I don't want to be blowing clouds everywhere when I'm out. The Juul is absolutely amazing IMO because I can truly "stealth vape!"\u000a\u000aThe nicotine strength is actually 5%, so that comes out to about 59 mg/mL, not 15 mg/mL. Yes, it sounds absurdly high, and the first few hits off this thing will feel like you just sprinted a 5K. However, you get used to the hit and it feels absolutely satisfying.\u000a\u000aThe nicotine buzz is very pleasant, and a few bros from my fraternity that smoke claim this is the only alternative vape that would satisfy them enough to quit smoking. A handful of us vape at our house, so they've tried all the sub-ohm setups and all that!\u000a\u000aI have to give this my highest recommendation! I mean, I rebuild and even DIY juice to cut costs, yet I still buy these pods!
p908
aVWhat's your setup? I have other setups besides the Juul hahah!
p909
aVYes, and there's an even bigger difference between a $50 and $75 one.\u000a\u000aIf you're doing this, commit to it. You spend ~\u20ac100 in two months on cigarettes, that's now your budget. You can keep smoking and spend it in two months, or you can start vaping and spend it all upfront. With the possible benefit that you can lay it all down in two months (or less) and have that \u20ac30-50 all to yourself again. Or keep vaping and just buying Juice, which *should* be less (don't know anything about EU regulations, sorry). Or fail and pick up smoking again, of course, but if you spend money and are serious that's *much* less likely. \u000a\u000aThis will be hard and take work on your part but it's doable. I quit on a shitty cigalike (cigarette style vaporizer, do not recommend) after 23 years of smoking and it's been ~2.5 years off now. You can do it, with will and determination and the right gear.\u000a\u000aOn to that - I don't have many specific recommendations, but I do suggest (if you're looking to *quit*, and not just get into a separate, very enjoyable, hobby) that you look into "MTL" setups, and higher nicotine. Do they have the Juul where you live? Do you know anyone that has one? I wish that that had been around when I quit, consistent high nicotine (salt, vs. the standard solution most B&amp;Ms offer), pocketable, etc. If not, take a look at the Von Erl offerings, or maybe an iCare with high nicotine solution. Those should all be affordable options, if you shop around.
p910
aVGet the Juul, my friend. See you in a couple of days when you're smoke free.
p911
aVAlternative is the Eleaf icare, got one as my in-car/out and about. Pretty much like the juul but takes any eliquid instead of cartridges 
p912
aVGrab a juul for these exact occasions - that way you have a backup thats quite different, and as close to a cigarette as you can get. Basically, more gear is another line of defense. Cant get no satisfaction [from your mod while drinking]? Maybe this will leave you satisfied, its worth a try before another cigarette
p913
aVThis is not bad at all. Juuls are much higher Nic and "act" more like a smoke. 
p914
aVIm a newbie and have only tried ones like juul, sourin drop and vagon, and the SMOK badge. Do you use salt nics or eJuice? I\u2019ve only tried the salts, but like the variety of flavors available in eJuice. I\u2019m really trying to quit smoking cigs and have read people saying that the box mods are the best way to do that. I am leary of the complexity of coils and cotton and the lingo left me confused. I have been doing research and this sub reddit on vaping had been helping me!! I\u2019m actually becoming addicted to this page! Thanks 
p915
aVJuul Pods and bad business practices
p916
aVIt's happening because Juul stopped selling all flavored pods to distribution companies and retail stores, they'll only sell them cool mint, menthol, and tobacco flavors.  When Juul announced this the distribution companies skyrocketed their flavored pod prices within about an hour or two.  These shops that were paying somewhere around $10 wholesale for a pack of pods are now paying around $30 wholesale with Mango being the most expensive.  Unfortunately this is probably only the beginning of the price increases, I'm sure they'll keep going up as distribution companies run out as well.  With that being said you can still go to Juul's website and order whatever pods you want straight to your door for the normal price, it's just going to be harder to find them in brick and mortar stores as time goes on.
p917
aVI guess I read your post too quickly earlier before I commented.  If your company is charging these other stores the regular old prices and didn't upcharge them after Juul sent their last shipment then yeah I'd say they're using shitty practices jacking the price up in the store.  Where I'm at all the bigger or semi-local distros jacked their prices up so we pulled them off our shelves and replaced them while other local stores think they'll still sell at $35-$40 a pack

aVUsing Vape Juice to refill a Juul pod
p920
aVI went from 45mg (refilling a Juul) to 6mg sub-ohm and didn\u2019t really notice a difference 
p921
aVbuy her a juul. easiest and closest to cigs
p922
aVJuuls actually already at 59mg/ml, so it definatly higher than a 50mg limit
p923
aVJuul Compatible, refillable, more durable than Juul pods! I'm using bubblegum :D
p924
aVQuestion about the novo. I\u2019m looking for a Juul replacement but want a pod system that clouds the same as the Juul. In other words doesn\u2019t produce clouds like a full mod does. Does the novo compare?? 
p925
aVI just got the novo to get off the juul. I was using the juul for around 2 years and the novo has been a very good replacement. Only use my juul when I go out drinking now and the novo daily
p926
aVI was a juul pod and a half a day guy. Novo pods last me 3 days with 3-4 refills
p927
aVJuul can give you a pretty good nicotine high,regular juice in a mod is pretty subtle if your not waay up there in nic.imo
p928
aVMouth to lung, like a cig or juul. DL means direct lung, like an RDA.
p929
aVI was vaping a juul pod in a day and that's supposed to be a full pack worth of nic. Half a cigarette knocks me on my ass.
p930
aVI never smoked but I picked up vaping because the idea of inhaling vapor that tastes like candy really intrigued me lmao. I started with no nicotine but after doing hours of research and thinking I decided to buy a bottle of 3mg nicotine juice to try it out and it gave me a really nice headbuzz that I really enjoyed. Eventually your tolerance goes up, so the only way around that is to buy higher nicotine level juices. I would not say I was addicted to the nicotine, I just enjoyed getting a headbuzz first thing in the morning. I tried every level of nicotine until I decided to buy a juul. The nicotine levels in a juul are around 50mg and before that I was on 24 mg and the headbuzz it gave me was way more intense. Eventually my tolerance rose to where 50mg did nothing for me and I decided to quit using high nicotine juice and exclusively vape 0-3mg nicotine juices. Personally I did not find it difficult whatsoever to quit vaping nicotine, it\u2019s been about a year and I\u2019ve only vaped high nicotine levels occasionally with some friends. I vape for the flavors of the juice and the satisfaction of blowing huge clouds, not for the nicotine. I haven\u2019t experienced any form of addiction after using it for a year and no negative side effects as well but vaping nicotine is relatively new so no one really knows the ultimate long term effects. 
p931
aVSmoked cigs for 7years and i switched to juuls about 3years later i lost a job and could not afford pods anymore so i went back to cigs for a month(till i found another job then switched to a mod)anyways when i went back to cigs i did notice a drop in pleasure.that doesn't mean it more addicting its subjective if one finds more pleasure in vaping than it will release more dopamine and you would be more "addicted" to vaping,but if one finds cigs more pleasurable then the cigs would be more addictive.its SUBJECTIVE so you would say i am more addicted to vaping,not vaping is more addictive,very lazzy post.
p932
aVI do! I basically haven't touched any of my other vapes since getting the Alto. It has the smoothest, quietest, and most satisfying out of all the pod systems I've tried (Juul, Phix, Myle, plus various refillables). I use the mixed fruit pods which aren't the greatest tasting (Phix blue raspberry gets that accolade), but it's a fair trade off. Love my Alto. 
p933
aVThis is so close to being a Juul killer for me.  Its better in every way except for the taste.  If they could improve the flavors, it would be the best gas station vape hands down.   
p934
aV(Update) Juul Engraving Website Launched
p935
aV10mg for nic salt is really low. Juul pods have 50mg pretty sure you're good 
p936
aVIf you go online and look up information on nicotine, you'll see that it takes quite a lot to be toxic.  Juul's are 50 mG though they probably aren't used for direct-lung.  While you are looking into how nicotine affects the body, you'll see the problem will arise more from complications with existing conditions (like high blood pressure) over actual toxicity.  You have the ability to become well informed via the Internet.  :)\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aP.S.  Go by Wikipedia more than WebMD.  The latter is biased towards "preserving" your health.  Same thing as if you were looking into caffeine.
p937
aVok, i also feel like it\u2019s the best option for me because my juul has been hitting thin and spitting and i just want a reliable vape. i\u2019m looking for more milky clouds 
p938
aVIs there other juice that has the same nic feeling that strong nic salts do? I was using a mod a 3mg for a while then I tried a juul and realized it's all I needed. Small, compact, 2 hits (mtl) and I'm really feeling the buzz just like a cig. I get the numbers though..
p939
aVNo. Nic salts are different than regular nicotine juice. However, you can dilute nic salt juices to put in a regular tank/atty, or you can get a pod system that allows you to refill the pod, unlike the Juul.\u000a\u000aMy Smok Rolo Badge for example fits at least twice the amount of juice than a Juul does, and I can keep refilling it until it starts to go bad in about 2-2.5 weeks. Nic salt juice goes a long way too.

aVJuul Nicotine Content Claims Don't Add Up
p945
aVI've tried posting this to the /r/Juul sub, but it has not showed up yet. Not sure if they need to manually approve it, or if it is being removed by the mods.
p946
aVI\u2019m gonna save you a lot of trouble and tell you to stay away from smok. \u000a\u000aAs far as temp control goes. You won\u2019t really use that feature much if at all with tanks. It\u2019s primarily for people that build coils in an rda/rta/rdta. And even then a lot of people just stick with wattage mode. Almost all mods now have TC but you don\u2019t need to worry about that feature. \u000a\u000aI totally understand the juul thing and why you wanna switch to something else. But if you don\u2019t mind me asking is there a reason you\u2019re looking at box mods?  A pod system with some high nic salt juice might suit what you are looking for a little better. 
p947
aVIt\u2019s just something I\u2019ve always been interested in. I\u2019m still going to use my juul and am just hoping that with a big ole nice cloud blower that I\u2019d tend to save a little more money and smoke that. I\u2019ve always liked smoking and I\u2019ve always wanted a mod type vape before. You\u2019re probably right though about staying with a pod type system, but it\u2019s something I wanna try. I\u2019m really hoping it will be enough for me, I\u2019d rather not waste my money but at the same time it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been interested in for awhile. It feels like a hard decision because I\u2019m a very indecisive person but that\u2019s a whole different topic lol\u000a\u000aI\u2019m not doubting what you said about smok at all, I was just told by someone and read things online saying they were great. May I ask what the trouble is with them and could you maybe point me in a different direction? Like I said before this is all new to me and I really appreciate your feedback to enlighten me. \u000a\u000aThank you. 
p948
aVSmok....  oh boy where to start. I\u2019ll start with the light and go to the hard. \u000a\u000aTanks leak like a sieve, coils are trash and 1/4 in a pack at least will be a dud and the others won\u2019t last more than a week because smok doesn\u2019t believe in quality control. The chips and internals in them are subpar. They are overpriced as all hell. \u000a\u000aNow the serious side of things. They are notorious for having meltdowns. Not all of them do but I\u2019ll tell you almost all the meltdowns I have seen are smok. And the part that makes me hate them the most is that unlike other companies that do something about it smok just says \u201csorry I almost burned down your house here\u2019s a 50% off coupon for another\u201d. They are an irresponsible company.  They release a new product every 2 weeks to the point that they can\u2019t keep up with themselves and their quality control severely suffers. To a dangerous degree.\u000a\u000aNow if you wanna go the box mod route do know that the nicotine levels you\u2019re gonna get are gonna pale in comparison to the juul. You can\u2019t use salt nic in them and it\u2019s gonna be a different kind of vape. There\u2019s nothing negative about that just something to note so you know what to expect. \u000a\u000aI recommend either an Aegis Legend or Nova (both by Geekvape) and a Freemax Mesh pro tank. \u000a\u000aAlso the VooPoo drag 2 and mini are excellent options. Both come as a kit and have pretty decent tanks with them. \u000a\u000aIf you like the flashier bigger screens Vaporesso (have had bad luck personally with them but they are well loved in the industry) has the luxe and polar kits that will be decent and closer to the style of the species. \u000a\u000aAdditionally you\u2019re gonna want to ask yourself if you want internal or external batteries. The pros of external are that you can carry spares (in a case for safety of course) and once the battery diminishes in capacity over time you don\u2019t have to replace the batteries. The pros of internal are that it\u2019s simply less things to worry about. You might need to charge it more throughout the day but you can do so through the mod so it\u2019s easier and cheaper than an external charger.\u000a\u000aIf you want to go the internal battery route I\u2019d get a Voopoo Drag Mini. The kit tank is, like I said, pretty great for a kit tank. And the battery life on it is impressive. It\u2019s the only internal mod I have in my regular rotation.\u000a\u000aFor external I would personally go with an Aegis Legend and Freemax Mesh pro. The legend is drop, dust and waterproof and it isn\u2019t a gimmick. I have two of them and the 100w half size version and they are damn near bulletproof.\u000a\u000aThat being said any of the above mentioned mods will be good bets for you if that isn\u2019t your style. \u000a\u000aBut as attractive as some of the mods may be please stay away from smok. It\u2019s gonna give you a lot more of a headache than you want. \u000a\u000aGood luck and congrats on quitting btw!!!  Feel free to post on here or pm me if you have any other questions!!!  \U0001f44d\U0001f44d

aVHaha I have my juul with another damn pod that\u2019s started leaking as soon as I popped it in. \U0001f644 I was aware of the whole nic salt difference and I\u2019m just hoping that regular juice will help me lower my nicotine cravings slightly because I\u2019m just such a stress/bordom smoker and don\u2019t really have the money to go through these things as much as I do. I\u2019m looking at the vaporesso luxe right now and must say I realllly like it. It\u2019s a shame the iris design is sold out. 
p950
aVHold on I\u2019m gonna pm you. I don\u2019t want everyone going all up in arms about what I have to say about juul. \U0001f923
p951
aVDo the pods last a decent amount of time? I use the Juul and replace the pod every 4 days about and I\u2019d like to switch to a budget friendly refillable pod system for juice variety n to save a little on pods 
p952
aVAll of these will last longer than a juul, and end up being cheaper. The Mi-Pod probably has the longest lasting coils out of anything here. 
p953
aVI switched from Juul to Sourin Air and I've been saving a ton. Being able to pick your own juice and nic strength is great and the pods last about 2-4 refills for me and I can usually get just over a week of life on them.
p954
aVThank u so much! I have a smok prince but I recently switched to juul...switching to juno tho this weekend but they arent refillable. \u000a\u000aI may switch back to my smok if I can get cbd juice. Koi is a good brand? Good quality cbd? Ive had some cbd before that didnt even give me any effects but ive also had really good cbd candy too.
p955
aVNo problem! I get that! Never personally used a juul cause I\u2019ve been told the spitback on those is crazy bad! Koi is a really good brand for CBD in my opinion! I haven\u2019t tried their actual vape juices but I know their cbd worked really well for me! Plus some brands you may have to go higher on the MG to get the full effect! I usually get vape tongue super easily but never did with the cbd! They released this new flavoring for it called strawberry blast or something like that and it\u2019s like crack! (Or at least what I imagine crack would be like lmao). It\u2019s all just dependent on personal preferences and your own immunities/how often you use stuff like that. Same thing with nicotine levels in vaping; each person is different. I used 12MG in vaping for a bit and then I went down to 6 but if my boyfriend hits a 6 he dies lol
p956
aVDo you know how many 14 and younger kids have Juuls? At least he\u2019s not smoking cigs like most of my friends did at that age. Hell if vapes were around when I was that age I\u2019d have been doing that and maybe would have been less stressed in school. 
p957
aVThe Juul Is Dead To Me.
p958
aVHey bud. Try the Kilo 1K POF system. I have the JUUL and this device and the KILO is hands down better. There is not an issue with having to reseat the pod, like in the JUUL, to get a good drag. The battery life literally lasts me all day. Sometimes more than a day. Check it out on YouTube. \u000a\u000aHope this helps. 
p959
aVI have a lost vape Orion on order, but didn't want to battle the Juul pods any longer so I stopped into a shop in the bigger town while taking my daughter in for an orthodontist appt.\u000a\u000aI picked up the boulder rock and a pack of pods. Pretty impressed with it for the price.
p960
aVJUUL OR DIE!!! xD xD xD\u000a\u000a[https://youtu.be/yTj9TY\u005c_DRCg?t=343](https://youtu.be/yTj9TY_DRCg?t=343)
p961
aVThe i couldn't wait for my Orion to arrive so got something to get me by because i am sick of Juuls.
p962
aVThis isn't a bad little device, better than the Juul. The pods hold a good amount of liquid and decent flavor.
p963
aVBoulder Rock http://www.bouldercigs.com/index.php/Ecigs/rock\u000a\u000aI stopped in the vape shop and told them I am sick of using Juuls and had a Lost Vape Orion on the way but wanted something to get me through the week, and to have as a backup. They recommend this. I think it is actually cheaper than a Juul, but so much more satisfying hits.
p964
aVCan i fill my Juul?
p965
aVIf you did little juul fairies would come and muck you up 
p966
aVJuul does not make pods without nicotine, but there are other pod systems made to be refilled. If you want to refill the pods you currently have, there may still be videos on YouTube that can instruct you on how to do it.
p967
aV\U0001f602\U0001f602 I bet nobody would buy a juul again
p968
aVJuul
p969
aVThis is the type of shit that makes lawmakers want to ban vapes, people who treat nicotine like its crack and keep fucking with higher and higher nicotine to get a \u201chead rush\u201d like some 16 year old Juul challenge kid 
p970
aVI still use the juul with the pods refilled with the same blue lemonade as the sub ohm tank when I\u2019m out and about or at work.  I only use the mod at home or while driving really.  I\u2019m scared to drop it :0. \u000a\u000aI like it so much:)
p971
aVIdk: I just quit smoking cigs less then a month ago and I already bought the juul and the vaporesso revenger plus thatextra tank.   So I\u2019ve already spent a lot of money.    And while the juul isn\u2019t the greatest, I can buy pods anywhere and refill them up to five times each, which makes it pretty cheap.  And I can get pods online for even cheaper.  So overall I\u2019m pretty happy with the juul.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m open to suggestions though: what do you recommend?  I\u2019d want something with more vapor production that can use salts but that\u2019s similar in size.
p972
aVCan attest to the lost vape orion, had the smok fit and wife had the juul, we both switched to the orion its light years ahead of other pods
p973
aVPick up a Novo this morning instead of juul pods, very happy I did
p974
aVJuul Alternative
p975
aVKwit Stick is my favorite and I have tried many. Fair warning, the tobacco flavor is trash and always prime the pod after refill, if you don't then it burns the wick and ruins the pod, I'm currently getting 6+ refills per pod. Other than that the hits are strong and consistent, no leaks, FAST charging and its cheap to use. They give you 10% off your first order and frequently send you emails for 10% coupon codes if you buy from their site rather than a wholesaler. They screwed up my order once but sent the missing item same day with no questions asked. Highly recommended over Juul, Ziip, Phix, Fit, Inifinix, Drop, and myBlu.
p976
aVGot it today ! Yay !\u000aSo, a little backstory. I\u2019m sick with the cold, flu, or sinusitis, or something of the sort and it\u2019s been kicking my butt this past week, specifically this past weekend. Spent the weekend being semi productive on Saturday which led to my downfall Sunday and resulted in me being a blanket burrito all of Sunday. Every time I touched the Juul would result in me coughing until my lungs hurt. \u000aWoke up today and felt great. Inhaled the Juul and coughed like crazy. \u000aGot the kilo 1-k, charged it (love they is micro usb) and stuck a pod in there (they looked huge compared to Juul Pods). I got the lemon berry ice and decided to go for it. Taste was light and sweet. Didn\u2019t hack up half my lung! \u000a\u000aI\u2019ll write a better comparative once my lungs function normally again. \U0001f601
p977
aVAny small vapes similar in size to a Juul?
p978
aVNot a whole lot of vapes that small. Like at all. A refillable pod system might be your best bet the renova zero is a super highly regarded pod system that would be close to a juul like vape and size.
p979
aVOh ywah sorry! I mean a refillable tank not a pod system if that helps! Doesn't have to be as small as a Juul but something smaller than the normal bulky system 
p980
aVThat\u2019s not a bad grab at all given the JUUL is around the same price , and I\u2019m sure this blows a JUUL outta the water.\u000a\u000aI haven\u2019t found a local shop where I\u2019m at that carries them tho
p981
aVWhere I\u2019m located the juul is significantly cheaper than this, but regardless the Orion is indeed a superior device, I have one, juul is too limiting with flavors and nic strength
p982
aVOh man the Juuls by me sell for around $50 or so but any advice on juice flavors or nix strength for the Orion? I currently vape one hit wonders juices with 3 or 6 nic in box mod. For my Juul I just buy those expensive ass pods
p983
aVJesus! my gas station sells Juuls for 12.99
p984
aVDamn, nice grab. I was gonna buy myself a mod too during Black Friday but my go to store I went to wasn\u2019t having any sale so I\u2019m just stuck with my friends JUUL that I borrowed lol
p985
aVI'm in Canada and vape B+Ms are popping up everywhere, they're booming. 64.99 is what JUUL charges on their website too btw. Only way to get it cheaper is to order from China.
p986
aVBut thats the things i think when they say "ecig" i think tuere referring to vuse,juul,and blu.
p987
aVI've been saying this since forever and nobody believes Me.\u000a\u000aThis is the most underrated device ever and cheap as balls.\u000a\u000aPeople are drooling over orions, juuls suorin and other crap while this cheap pod just keeps chugging and it's cheap too.
p988
aVWhy are there toilets in the Juul room?
p989
aVLoving it. I was vaping on a Juul before this so this is one hell of an upgrade 
p990
aVI just ordered one last night. Will have to try that juice.\u000a\u000aI was using a Smok alien 220 for a long time got sick if it and switched to using juul. The pods were getting to be expensive but I like the simplicity.\u000a\u000aDecided on the Orion because of the looks and reviews here.
p991
aVthe juul is a very small device this shouldnt raise any suspicion should it?\u000a
p992
aVJUUL by PAX
p993
aVI've got a JUUL for a CIG a like style. It's not circular, it's rectangular so it looks "odd" but it definitely does a decent job of replicating the cigarette style sensation better than the bigger devices. \u000a\u000aTheir tobacco flavor isn't half bad either (better than Vuze) and the vapor production is solid and on par with a real cigarette. \u000a\u000aThe best part is I picked up the JUUL while traveling so I could have something smaller than my mod and I'm still using it a month or two later. It's not my primary device buy I still use about 1/4 of a cartridge per day. 
p994
aVStart him out with the pax juul. I was a super heavy smoker and has attempted unsuccessfully to make the switch time and again. And tried pretty much all the different styles of devices. None did the trick until I came across the juul. It drags so much like a cigarette, there are no buttons to press, and it is ultra portable. I bought a couple of them so I could already keep one charged and alternate flavors through out the day while getting accustomed to inhaling vapor instead of smoke. Also the juice is something special it really kicks the shit out of the nicotine cravings and that is key to not getting too frustrated early on. I still use mine when I'm drinking and feeling week. Lol there is a good article on them below. Seriously can't recommend them enough. I never thought I could make the switch.\u000ahttp://www.wired.com/2015/04/pax-juul-ecig/

aVSunflower Pipe's Juul by Pax Product Review
p998
aVIt's the same stuff as a fog machine with nicotine added. Not just "water vapor" but also not very harmful at all. I was bitched at recently for using my vape at a concert that made heavy use of a fog machine recently. Things almost got heated, mainly because moron couldn't realize that the fog machine was pumping out more vapor than my little JUUL ever could. Morons.
p999
aVI have a ton of vape setups and they're great and got me off cigs but recently I needed something small and discreet to use at customer sites for work when I didn't want to blow clouds outside their buildings.  I picked up a Juul kit because I liked that it didn't look like a cigarette, wasn't owned by Big Tobacco and heard the flavors were decent.  It is by far the closest to a cigarette experience I've found, the nic hit is instant and powerful and the flavors are actually really good.  They're not cheap but I would highly recommend buying one to use for those times you feel like you really need a cig, I think it would be very effective for that.
p1000
aVpax juul is tiny
p1001
aVI have a Juul in my work bag for super stealth vape at customer sites when needed and it works well enough nic/flavor wise.  It's nice too being able to see how much liquid you have left but they're pricey.\u000a\u000aQuit for a couple weeks using Blu's, not a huge fan of the disposables but the higher priced ones got the job done for a bit but I was ready to give up when I decided to visit a vape shop instead of buy a pack of cigarettes.

aVNew "e-Cig" called Juul...sounds a little interesting. Thoughts?
p1005
aVThe Juul is what you'd get if VUSE and TARS of Intersteller mated and had a love child.
p1006
aVYa I really, really want a Pax based on what everyone has said. I just still can't justify the price for the device. Maybe for my birthday or something. If this Juul is as good they may have a killer product.
p1007
aV"You do look a little like you plugged a USB stick into your mouth when you use it, but it\u2019s undeniably cooler than that insipid mess of tubes and glowsticks you\u2019re probably using now." \u000a\u000a"... there\u2019s something wonderfully satisfying about dropping it into the magnetic charger. (Magnets!) If you wave the Juul around, it lights up in a rainbow of colors."\u000a\u000aSorta the same thing, ain't it?
p1008
aVHave you considered picking up a pen type vape and a high nicotine juice for when those cravings become unbearable? Maybe an iCare? A Juul? 
p1009
aVGet a JUUL
p1010
aVI would recommend the juul. Very low maintenance, easy to use, and has the perfect amount of nicotine for someone looking to quit smoking.
p1011
aVRipTrippers recommends the juul ecig for newcomers to vaping from smoking. I'd recommend looking into that. It might be a little more expensive over long term but it's simple and a good way to get exposed to vaping.\u000a\u000aYouTube "riptrippers juul" to watch an overview.
p1012
aVGet him a Juul. I have 3 co-workers that haven't smoked in over a year because of this cig-a-like. It may not look like much but I know it does the job. Good luck
p1013
aVJuul with tobacco flavor is the closest to a cigarette I have tried, by far. Plus no refilling even? Costs a bit but much cheaper than all those cigarettes I bet, even if not it can allow him to get off of them and maybe switch to a cheaper vaping alternative
p1014
aVI'd recommend the Myjet over the juul. It's the same device but you have the option of filling your own cartridges instead of worrying about buying pre fill cartridges. 
p1015
aVOr an eleaf icare. Unless there is somewhere that keeps juul carts in stock he will go right back to smoking. The myjet and icare are great low cost all in ones that don't rely on refilled cartridges.
p1016
aVIf you want coil heads - nautilus mini. If you don't mind building - Kayfun Mini V1/2/3.\u000a\u000a\u000a**EDIT:** Or a Juul. Those are great to quit smoking (or so I hear) and probably resemble a cigarette more than a bigger(ish), more cumbersome(ish) setup like those I mentioned above.
p1017
aVFormer Juul-er looking to switch
p1018
aVI recommend getting a capable mod instead of a "starter".  Starters tend to have low wattage and non-replaceable batteries with low capacity.  Even if you don't use all the capabilities today, you might eventually.\u000a\u000aYou are immensely spoiled by the size of the Juul.  I can't think of another device that comes close to its size.  Are you looking for a cigalike shape like the ego/evod or are you willing to try a box mod?
p1019
aVDefinitely willing to try a box mod. And yeah I totally get that there is nothing that even remotely rivals the size of the Juul. That's fine, I can live with something bigger for sure. Any pointers on a decent box mod?
p1020
aVNot to detract all all from /u/TheBlackDred below - he has great suggestions that have definite benefits in the size department with the way the tanks are subsumed into the form factor of the mod.\u000a\u000aMy favorite is the Smok Alien.  It's a dual-cell 18650 mod, has really nice firmware, and gives you the flexibility to explore whichever style of vaping interests you since it has variable wattage and temperature control modes with a maximum 250W.  These features describe a lot of mods in its price range, but I'm very impressed with the build quality of the Alien.  I really like that the Alien has a bar to press to turn on the coil instead of a button.  It feels very comfortable.  It also has an OLED screen with all the pertinent information on it simultaneously.  I really like that.\u000a\u000aThe Alien with a tank and two batteries weighs about the same as 500 Juuls. J/K.  You're spoiled there, too.  My combo weighs about 282g.  Juul weighs 15g. :)\u000a\u000aMy strongest advice, far above any brand or model, is to make sure you aren't wasting money on a purchase that you might outgrow too quickly.
p1021
aVIcare or Icare mini are nice if you want something similar to juul
p1022
aVJuul.
p1023
aVI know the thing is great but floods immediately. I just want something that doesnt suck to get my GF off of cigarettes but all the cheap shit is adding up... kanger subvod, leaks like a bastard. Ego aio box, burnt hits immediately. iCare mini, might as well stick a straw in the bottle and call it a day. Oh except that wouldn't burn your mouth and lips, so that would actually be better. \u000a\u000aThere is the juul but pods get expensive quick, and weve already wasted 30, plus 30, plus 30 dollars (plus money for coils and juice each time...) on shit that sucks ass yet gets fine reviews. Then you actually read up and everyone that gets one has the same issue. Damn shill reviewers... and random "lucky" people that somehow have never had a kanger product leak or a teeny tiny coil fail to wick max VG juice... do you just live in burnthitsville and not notice? Or is quality control just so bad that all of these devices are in fact perfect, when you happen to get one out of ten that meets all the tolerances?
p1024
aVI've had some luck refilling an older family member's juul pods - youtube has several walkthroughs.
p1025
aV1. Love them. Have two. \u000a2. My most expensive mod is probably $60 or so. Nothing crazy. \u000a3. https://i.imgur.com/sIONPdD.jpg\u000a4. Amalfi, Bigglesworth Labs. 12mg, 50/50. It\u2019s the best. \u000a\u000a****\u000aEDIT: I think I misunderstood #2. So far this year I\u2019ve spent $1,500 or so. That\u2019s including all the mods, several dozen flavor concentrates, a scale, coil jigs, wire, cotton, batteries, charger, coils, magnetic mixer, more mods, JUUL pods, atomizer stand, PG, VG, more VG, syringes, pipettes, flasks, beakers, funnels, RDAs, RTAs, subohm tanks, a shelf to hold this shit, battery cases, little straps to keep the wire spools from unspooling\u2026 oh, and juice. You get the idea. 
p1026
aV1: the juul is alright, but there are better basic devices out there at this point. The icare and the myjet are better in my opinion. \u000a\u000a2: I have no idea how much I've spent on mods/upgrades and I don't really wanna know as I've got a decent collection of some mid range ($100-150) to high end ($150+) mods and I really don't want to calculate what I've spent haha. \u000a\u000a3: not sure I have any pics but my prized possession in vaping is my provari P3 and my kayfun v4. It just works and it's my go to set up. Edit: just took a pic of it [here](https://imgur.com/a/S37Is) \u000a\u000a4: favorite juice? Probably gambit by five pawns or indigoRY4. 
p1027
aV"A shelf to hold all this shit" ahahaha.\u000a\u000aIf you don't mind me asking, why do you have two Juuls?
p1028
aVStandard \u201cTwo is one and one is none\u201d philosophy. \u000a\u000aI initially had just the one. I went on a camping trip and forgot to bring my charger along. It died on me and I had to make do with a Vuse for the rest of the weekend. It sucked. As soon as I got back home, I was going to get another charger ($10), then realized that for $40 more, I could get a backup Juul and another four pods. So that\u2019s what I did. 
p1029
aV1) I like them for stealth vaping, but if I wanted something like a juul I'd get an eleaf iCare.\u000a\u000a2) ummm probably 2-3k in the last 6 months.\u000a\u000a3)I'm still trying to get my hands on a tiffany blue tugboat box mod....\u000a\u000a4) RKOI by coilspill. It's a strawberry champagne flavor or recently I've really been digging lava flow by naked
p1030
aVI'd say go for a juul
p1031
aV+1 for Juul. 
p1032
aVjuul
p1033
aVIf lightness and portability are your preference, I'd say nothing comes close to the Juul. The thing is so small it can fit in your wallet. The pull is very akin to a cigarette and you'll get your nic fix in a couple of hits. I'm pretty sure it's around $50 for a starter kit that comes with the device, charger, and 4 pods. 
p1034
aVI\u2019ve successfully snuck in my JUUL a couple of times. Just jammed it in my shoe. I can\u2019t remember if I walked through a metal detector or not, though. \u000a\u000a/u/Onitsuj\u2019s solution is way more foolproof. You\u2019re already putting your keys in the bowl when you walk through the detector, so it won\u2019t trigger that. 
p1035
aVDIY Juul Charger??! LOL
p1036
aVr/juul loves this kind of stuff
p1037
aVWhat's up guys, new here! Still trying to familiarize myself with Reddit.\u000a\u000aFinally made the switch from a box mod/tank set up to a closed system device.\u000a\u000aAnd holy shit... The JUUL is fucking great! I've been vaping since 2013 and this device is pretty damn awesome. My biggest gripe would be expensive pods. Although, I do enjoy the nicotine delivery. Gets me pretty light headed and gets me to vape less... for now. Any other Juul users in here and do you guys have any alternatives to refilling? 
p1038
aVI don't use my juul any more but I must say it is super satisfying to hit. It is possible to refill the pods if you find they are getting to expensive
p1039
aVHow come you don't use it anymore? I started messing with it and tried refilling it with some old 18mg that i had laying around. Definitely not as satisfying as the JUUL pods but i've been hearing some good things about Mr. Salt-E on the facebook groups. Gonna give that try when it comes in. 
p1040
aVhey man I'm realy thinking about getting a Icare mini. Can you compare this to the juul in any way. how it hits and such
p1041
aVI have not tried the Juul. I know it's fairly popular tho. \u000a\u000aAll I can tell you about is the icare mini. The Mini has a pretty tight air flow, like sucking a milkshake through a straw. You need to use higher nic unless you're going to take a lot of hits because you aren't getting as much vapor per hit. Flavor is fine, not amazing but it's good. Not much cloud obviously but you'd be surprised. \u000a\u000aCoils last a decent amount of time and the base recharges it fast, you can use it with the base attached as well or direct charge to the actual mod. \u000a\u000aThey're cheap so maybe pick both up.
p1042
aVJust talked to guy who has a Juul. Says they are way better than the Mini. \u000a\u000aSays it has 50 nic but almost no hit, and after about three hits he's done. \u000a \u000aUses cartridges and is rechargeable.
p1043
aVThis. Or all in one/pod systems like the iCare, Juul, or MyJet. Any simple system that are like cigarettes. For the MyJet or iCare, just make sure you get him some 18mg, especially if he was a consistent smoker.\u000aEdit: The Juul also has a really nice menthol flavor, and with that he wouldn't even have to buy juice, they just come in pod packs that he snaps in when one runs dry.\u000aEdit 2: [I have a post from earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/5ewry0/looking_for_a_setup_for_my_mom/?st=IVZH392W&amp;sh=f242cc31), and it was about an individual looking for a setup for his mom, you can see what others are recommending.\u000a
p1044
aVJuul also has a really good throat hit and is very close to cigs i feel.
p1045
aVThank you I'll check the Juul out!
p1046
aVI would say check out the eleaf icare or the juul
p1047
aVi would suggest a device like the Juul, or try getting a MTL atomizer and run lower wattage/higher nic to get that feeling. 
p1048
aVI split my time among four devices:\u000a\u000a* __eGo AIO:__ 27ish watts on a 0.6\u03a9 coil\u000a* __eVic VTC Mini:__ 60\u201375 watts on a Crown 0.25\u03a9 or Griffin 0.55\u03a9 build\u000a* __Noisy Cricket:__ 110 watts on a 0.56\u03a9 build\u000a* __Pax JUUL:__ Huh? How the hell do I know?\u000a
p1049
aVJust wait once you get a juul pen they hit at 54mg now that's fun. 
p1050
aVEleaf Icare \u000aA nice step up from the juul
p1051
aVVery nice. Does the iCare have a button? Or is it like a Juul? 
p1052
aVIt's like the juul. Just draw and it'll hit. I just really like the fact that you can use any juice with it. 
p1053
aVGreat choice, also the myjet is a lot like the juul but better.
p1054
aVIt's not bad. The flavors not as good as the juul but you still get a pretty good taste out of it. 
p1055
aVCheck out the juul, you can get it from most gas station where I'm from which is US
p1056
aVTry picking up a juul or just a high nic tight mouth to lung set up. Thats what i do. Still don't do it in bars and the like but it helps alot when you can take a few puffs at 15mg or so and be good without blowing out a couple mls in an rda
p1057
aVI'm totally into the mini vape trend.  I just got a myjet and a JUUL for my recent trip to Florida and was pretty happy.  I would like to try one of these icares out too.\u000a\u000aI really wanna get some mr saltz nicotine salts juice for the myjet
p1058
aVI'm torn between this and the juul :/ 
p1059
aVI've tried both, I reccomend this over the JUUL but honestly both are very similar. I believe the battery on this is slightly larger too.
p1060
aVget an icare or a juul those are the closest things to cigarets and most importantly hassle free... \u000a\u000aa smoker set in his way who is not really interested in vaping won´t like having to maintain his vape gear and educate himself on the subject, if he gets into it by using the icare, than a upgrade later on is much more viable.\u000a\u000a\u000aalso why can´t the eleafe icare or the juul be used non stop in your opinion? \u000a\u000ahe won´t chainvape it... he is a smoker and he will use it like a cigarette... thats not chainvaping... and being a cigarette substitute is excatly what those were designed for.\u000a\u000aa pack a day is not so much that those devices couldn´t handle it...\u000a\u000aif you can afford to get a juul and buying the pods, which is a little bit \u000amore expensive than buing juice for the eleaf icare, go for the juul their juice uses nicotine salts and the effect is closer to a cigarette than other devices. It should still be cheaper than a pack a day.\u000a\u000a\u000aEdit: to be more specific on the pricing, one juul pod equals around one pack of cigarets and costs 4$ from the manufacturer... you can probably get them cheaper somewhere else online...
p1061
aVGreat idea, would recommend!\u000a\u000a\u000aEspecially with you yourself not vaping going with the smok tfv8 you can easily get new coils and are good to go.\u000a\u000a\u000aFor two total novices I would advise against an rta like the petri which was suggested above...\u000a\u000aBTW. If this is supposed to be an incentive to Stopp smoking, be aware that could also backfire the setups suggested here are great imho if someone is interested in vaping already. If not, I personally would her rather give a Juul or a eleafe icare and a nice other gift, which are both way more hassle free and cater more to a smoker wanting to quit imho.
p1062
aVPax juul for efficient vaping?
p1063
aVPods are relatively expensive, but they're easy to refill if you DIY or find a vendor who sells eliquid that's compatible (relatively thin, high nic). Most Pod refill eliquids won't use Nicotine Salts but I'm not entirely sold on that being what's so special about JuuL nic anyways. [There's a decent theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deeper_DIY/comments/3k6h2r/nicotine_freebase_vs_salt_absorption_vaporization/) that its the benzoic acid that makes Juul nic so special. \u000a\u000aI use a Juul myself on the occasion when a full APV kit isn't desirable (wearing a suit, formal occasions, hiking, quick errand trip, etc). I've found I get about a day's use out of a full battery and 1-2 days per pod, mostly with 30mg/ml refill eliquid. 
p1064
aVJuul
p1065
aVI love gooold. Anyways, the Juul uses nicotine salts from which I read it allows more nicotine absorption. The pods are really easy to refill. A simple YouTube search should explain it. But the cool thing is I found a liquid company that makes their juice with nicotine salts. [MrSaltE](https://gaslightvapor.com/collections/e-liquids/mr-salt-e-liquids) 
p1066
aVThe Myjet is also a great little device. Similar to the juul but with refillable "pods"  with built in coils. Definitely check it out. 
p1067
aVYou could look into the juul ecig. I have a buddy who loves his. I believe most ampms have them, and there's a review on YouTube by Riptrippers that breaks down what it is and how it works. It's one of his most recent videos too\u000a\u000aEdit: FYI, the juul is a super slim little device that activates automatically when you take a pull, so no button pressing, and the draw/airflow is supposed to be very close to that of a cig. It comes with a variety of flavors including a tobacco flavor, and it's very plug and play style, as all of the juice is contained in a little cartridge that you just insert into the device. Nicotine level is much stronger than any other ecig I've heard of too. 
p1068
aVWell if you're not too picky on flavour and just need something to kick the habit you can try the Juul. It's VERY compact, chargers via usb and has 4 different liquid pods containing like 5% of nicotine. \u000a\u000aDoesn't get simpler than inhaling when you want nicotine. Just remember to charge and change the liquid pods when empty.
p1069
aVEven a cheap vape not from the gas station (istick pico comes to mind) will be far better quality, perform better, last longer and give you an overall better experience. \u000a\u000aI've known a few people who use the vuse, juul, or other disposables and go back to smoking because they are unreliable and not cheap in the long run.\u000a\u000aAll my opinion but a cheap tank and mod (istick Pico, joytech aio, etc..) will give you a better chance at quiting or be less off putting to a future hobbyist. 
p1070
aVJuul is alright for a temporary replacement, say you're outta juice or cracked your tank or just waiting for a new mod. Just need that quick hit or something. 
p1071
aVGet a juul
p1072
aVFor those people recommend the juul, I tried to quit multiple times with blu and it never worked... the second I picked up a Juul (Jan 23, 2016) I was stinky free, and haven't had one since!  Even though I have a pico w/ a baby beast now, the juul still goes with me everywhere.
p1073
aVHere's how I kicked the habit; I bought the Juul, I put it on the charger when I had 2 stinkys left in my pack, I smoked the stinkys, and threw the pack away while the Juul charged, I switched to the juul and never picked up another cig!  I then graduated to legit vaping with an istick pico and a tfv8 baby beast, but I still hit that Juul though because it's the closest feeling to smoking a cig that I've found.  Good luck!
p1074
aVAlso 2 [JUUL](https://www.juulvapor.com) ecigs 
p1075
aVDepends in what you have the airflow set at. I use 12mg in this bad boy as a way of saving money. I think it's a better deal than the juul  because you don't have to buy the pods, and it comes with a pretty sweet extended battery thing. I wanna get some 12mg menthol juice and this thing will be off the hook. It's actually like enough to hold with your lips. 
p1076
aVThe juul by ploom. 
p1077
aVJuul
p1078
aVGuess it's not a popular opinion but I'd check out the Juul, if I was quitting now that's what I'd go with. Small, low maintenance, fairly available replacement pods, high nicotine, etc.
p1079
aVI quit over a year ago and I want a juul real bad. It's just kind of pricey.
p1080
aVThe reason I ask OP is because if you could manage, wire is pretty inexpensive, you could get 50ft of 22g kanthal from lightning vapes for something like 8$ or less. And organic cotton balls at a store that would last you months for like 5$. Honestly I would look into the gas station cig alikes. A juul or a vuse 
p1081
aVThese are called the JUUL and are made by a company called Ploom(you might know their juices). You replace the cartridges on top to refill then rather than buying juice in a bottle. They're activated when you pull air through. 
p1082
aVReally satisfying throat hit gets me buzzed in 2 pulls, 59mg tends to do that its good for out in public.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBut the wismec myjet is like an open tank system juul
p1083
aVJust a small correction,\u000aJuul is owned by Pax Labs. They used to be called Ploom but some of the products were bought by a Japanese tobacco company and they created a new company.\u000aPloom currently has ties to big tobacco while Pax Labs are the kings of herbal vaporizers (and now closed system e cigs imo)
p1084
aVLook into an ego AIO, endura t18/t22, or even a device like a juul or cync.  The first two are dead simple devices that have been on the market awhile and don't need anything other than a charge.  The juul and cync are closed systems that you can pick up until your symptoms subside, and due to their higher nicotine content, they may even work faster.  \u000a\u000aThe other route you could go is CBD oil, but that's not for everyone.
p1085
aVI personally would not suggest those. They don't have nic or throat hit. There's a new little gadget that came out recently called juul. You should check that out.
p1086
aVDon't use a Juul...   it's big tobacco trying to get into the vape business..  and junk...   A lot of newer vapers make the mistake of jumping into sub ohm setups out the gate for those big clouds and flavor.  if it is making you cough, why not try a smaller tank.  like the old school aspire nautilus.. at low wattage it's output is less, but alot better for new vapers.  also what nic juice are you using? 
p1087
aVMy little project, a brushed steel Juul
p1088
aVIf you take the battery out and torch the juul it will turn into a rose gold color
p1089
aVHaving it gold plated would be awesome. But yeah I haven't actually torched my juul but a few people I know have. One didn't take his battery out and it didn't end well
p1090
aVYeah thanks, I have a lavabox with a phenotype RDA and used to hate vapes like the Juul, but once I tried it I had to get one. They're just so easy to carry with you everywhere.
p1091
aVIt's definitely more of a cig than a vape, that's why I stick to my Lavabox for clouds and flavor and the Juul for nic
p1092
aVHow's the airflow on the juul? I'm was thinking about picking one up for my Gma, but she needs something that's mtl.
p1093
aVMaybe look into something like the JUUl, i've heard thats amazing for people who just wanna get that buzz and tight draw feel
p1094
aVLook into the Juul
p1095
aVThe juul is great and discreet, as well as the Von Erl. If you're looking for a more complex vape I second the Joytech AIO or D22 if you want more battery power. 
p1096
aVGet a Juul, it's crazy small, and you can use it as a backup when your batteries fail... Or just buy more batteries.  But the juul works great, closest thing to smoking a cig that I've ever found.
p1097
aVThe juul isn't really a "setup" it's more like an add-along, or a side dish, that little something extra for times when you can't be "loud"
p1098
aVI enjoy a hot vape. Try going up to 6mg and maybe it won't kill the flavor too much. I've also been interested in the juul for more of a nicotine quick fix. It has the same amount of Nic as a pack of cigs per pod.  Might be something worth trying! 
p1099
aVAn older gentleman might be inclined to enjoy the favors of a Juul, to start.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.juulvapor.com/\u000a\u000aLater, he may want to delve deeper into the Vape World.\u000a\u000a

aVGlad my boyfriend doesn't mind vaping, he'd rather me vape than smoke. \u000a\u000aBut seriously if she's acting like a child when you talk about it then you really need to have a serious talk about it, if you can. That's being too controlling over a dumb situation that doesn't affect her that much. \u000a\u000aYou could try not vaping around her so it doesn't cause tension or maybe get a JUUL or something similar to get your nic fix, but you won't be blowing clouds and stuff. 
p1102
aVI'd say the AIO or even a juul, if you want a pen mod, i think the subbox mini is the same as the nano, and the nano is the lightest mod i own, there is smaller mods, like the eLeaf Pico, but not necessarily lighter.
p1103
aVquestions on the juuls
p1104
aVI'm about a 3mg user with my rda's, 6mg in tanks.  Purchased the JUUL for stealth vaping on the go.  Found that in moderation the JUUL is a good supplement, just don't hit it too often.  At my local B&amp;M the employees puff on their JUUL's constantly...I could see that increasing the nic requirement quite a bit.  As long as I stay off the analogs, I don't sweat it too much.
p1105
aVThanks for the advice bro. I did that today at work I was hitting the juul when talking to customers but it still can't replace my smok tfv8 tank 
p1106
aVIs Juul Worth it's Price?
p1107
aVHoly wall of text :) (But I took the time)\u000a\u000aAnd I largely agree with every thing you wrote. I have two Juuls now, after having a "two is one and one is none" experience with it recently. I also have a dozen other mods, from a fleet of eGo AIOs to a few Noisy Crickets, Cool Fire TC100, VTC Mini, etc. RDAs and tanks and 1+\u03a9 mods.\u000a\u000aMy most-used devices are the AIOs for flavor and every day vaping, and the Juuls for when I'm having a beer or at a party. I'm only eight months from my smoking days, but drinking and socializing are still the events that make me miss smoking. And that's where the Juul really shines. Much more direct linkage between taking a hit and feeling the effects. Kills the cigarette craving cold.\u000a\u000aThe Bruule flavor is the only one I really like. Mint is ok. Tobacco and Fruit kinda suck in my opinion.\u000a\u000aCompared to the Vuse, Blu, etc, I think the Juuls are actually cheaper in the long run. The pods are about the same price, but I think they last longer than the cartridges for those other shitty cigalikes
p1108
aVYes. I use the Juul out out of convenience. No huge rectangular bulge in my pocket anymore. I like the Vape. \u000a\u000aIf you check my post just history, I have compared it to the MyJet and Cync. I still use Juul on a daily basis. 
p1109
aVAre there any similar products to the JUUL?
p1110
aVGet a juul and you won't some another cigg. It is the best cig alike I ever tried. I'm 7 months without a cigg after 15 years of smoking. I have a lot of mods and tanks and don't even use them anymore. The juul is just like smoking a butt. 
p1111
aV&gt; juul\u000a\u000aI've had at least 3 cigarette type vapes. None of them stuck. Very little options as far as flavor goes and the vapor production was always lackluster
p1112
aVJuuls are actually very good. They hit nice and hard and the flavors are good for the most part
p1113
aVSaw this on [Vaperazzi](https://www.instagram.com/p/BIq66iGBhsR/), apparently is just like juul but you can fill it with your own liquids.
p1114
aVI vapes for 4 months and I got sick of it. I have tons of vape gear and juice and I stopped using it because it was like inhaling hot sugar and nothing else. I switched to the juul and havent picked up a vape since. The nic is satisfying and it is just like a cigg. 
p1115
aVTrust me this thing is horrible the only good cigalike I've every used is the juul. 
p1116
aVAgreed. I still use my juul, mostly for stealth. I just can't figure out why these big tobacco companies can't make a good vape device with all their money.
p1117
aVI have my big mods that I use but I still keep a juul. It's nice for when I'm out in public and don't wanna be blowing huge clouds. Most of the juul flavors are pretty good too
p1118
aVjuul
p1119
aVI actually have a cubis tank for myself, and i got to be honest, im not really enjoying it so far and thinking of returning it, maybe i just got a bad one.\u000a\u000aJust checked out the VTC, theres a new one that can swap between 1/2 \u000ahttp://www.joyetech.com/category/evic-vtc/\u000aI might show her that and see what she thinks, \u000a\u000aThe mini vault and nugget look good, but will need her opinion, it might be too small length wise, but honestly i dont know, she can be pretty fussy lol\u000a\u000aregarding the von erl, that looks ideal , but i also showed her the juul as someone else suggested, and she wasn't keen on the idea of not being able to use her current ejuice ( which to be honest, is pretty annoying to myself &amp; my brothers as its the most basic menthol you could imagine... ) \u000a\u000aty for taking the time to provide me with a range of suggestions, im over hers today for dinner so ill try throw them all by her :)
p1120
aVMaybe let her try yours and see what she thinks about that style.\u000a\u000aSometimes those quitting don't want big clouds, and want the restrictiveness of a cigarette. Other options would be a joyetech auto or an endurance t18.\u000a\u000aThe wismec myjet also just came out. Kind of like a juul with refillable pods. There are tons if good starter kits to quit smoking without jumping head first into the rabbit hole 
p1121
aVWas it a [JUUL](https://www.juulvapor.com/), maybe?
p1122
aV/u/stomper38's got you covered on the how-to-buy part. I just want to take a moment and shill for this device. It blows Blu and Vuse completely out of the water. \u000a\u000aI took mine on a camping trip and forgot to bring the charger. Learned the 2-is-1 and 1-is-none lesson again. Now I have two Juuls (and two chargers). \u000a\u000aIf you have the option to buy it at a gas station, do that over buying it online. It should be the same price and you don't have to be at home to sign for the package. 
p1123
aVYeah. That's why I don't understand the comment. I guess OP thought Blu would be trying to use proprietary ingredients that the rest of the industry doesn't use?\u000a\u000aJUUL's e-liquid is something else, though. I have yet to find a comparable juice that is as satisfying at such low power. 
p1124
aVIs this the new cig a like that is competing with the Juul? 
p1125
aVAll hail the mighty juul!
p1126
aVYes. I have the Juul as well. I like the Juul but I can never find pods in my area.  
p1127
aVYeah, I've tried the Juul and I did like it, though people are always looking for those pods. 
p1128
aVThere's a place off of Jones in Cypress that carry Juul pods, next door to a scrapbook store. Sorry, don't remember the name.
p1129
aVI'd go with the AIO cheap and effective. The Juul you cant use your own juice.\u000aEdit - Fucking AUTO CORRECT
p1130
aVMods: Grip taped Dimitri, H-priv 220 TV, RX200, Lotus mafia, and Juul\u000a\u000aAttys: MutationX V3, Moonshot, Freakshow, and Royal Hunter, respectively
p1131
aVThe Pax Juul might fit the bill. Super discreet and relatively inexpensive. You'll do a spittake at the $/ml of the pods but each pod tends to last 1-2 days so I've found it to be either as expensive or cheaper than most vaping setups. \u000a\u000aThere's tutorials online of how to refill the pods too, which will get you 3-4 extra uses out of each one if you can find a company that does high-pg, high-nic (36+mg/ml) eliquid that you enjoy. 
p1132
aVBe careful of heat build up charging inside your purse though, extra heat in enclosed space is not so good.\u000a\u000aTake a look at a product called "Juul".\u000a\u000aIt's not a cloud machine, it's a nicotine delivery system in cigalike form, very small. Quite effective from what just about every user has said that I have read, a few here at ECR have them.\u000a\u000aCould use a back up, or itself an Subvod as back up, if you are just looking to quit smoking that is. If you want clouds, stay the course you are on.\u000a\u000aHope that makes sense an helps.\u000a\u000a
p1133
aVSome mtl like the nautilus mini or juul?
p1134
aVJust get a juul. Most of those type pens especially knock offs are cheaply made. To me it's worth spending money for peace of mind. Another good actually pen is the x2o pro v vape. It's around 25$ has good flavor and low variable voltage.
p1135
aVThe juul is a great device, I can't recommend it enough as a simple stealth vape for beginners and anyone who doesn't feel like getting into the advanced stuff... 
p1136
aVI bought a juul a couple days ago...
p1137
aVThe juul is a great device for its class. I was using it for a bit till I found sub ohm vaping.it was good then but now I'm used to getting a lot more vapor and flavor. Still makes a pretty good stealth mod though. I found a way to refill those little cartridges and put premium ejuice in. Works pretty good.
p1138
aVThe JUUL is an awesome little device. Just be careful, the pods that they say have a VERY high nic level. You can refill the cartridges pretty easily to save money, but then you don't get the "nicotine salts" that the pods offer. The JUUL is definitely the closest experience to an actual cigarette I have found. With the refilled pods it wasn't quite as enjoyable. 
p1139
aVBeen using the Juul for a while and finally made the switch! So... handcheck!
p1140
aVTake a look at the juul. Buy the kit and you don't need anything else to start.
p1141
aVwhatever you do, don't get a mech/stick/pen vape for varying reasons... mech - too complicated to start with, stick/pen - likely wont cut it.  Get a box mod, get one with TC/VW, with replaceable batteries.  \u000a\u000aI started with a VTC-VT kit, and now would recommend anyone to start by buying a mod an tank seperate.  If you have a physical shop ask them what they have.  I say this cause it would have saved me about $40 (Im in Aus so pricing is ridiculous here) if I didn't get the kit.\u000a\u000a(I don't know about the JUUL their kit tank may be far better than the eGo mega)

aVTrying to find aN online retailer of Juul Pods that doesn't require a 21+ signature.
p1145
aV... additionally, you might want to look into the Juul (Google is your friend), as it might be a good transitional device from cigarettes. 
p1146
aVI've had alot of friends switch from 100$ mods to the juul. I'd highly recommend it. 
p1147
aVRecenlty bought JUUL for my grandmother
p1148
aVYou did a good thing!  If she likes the juul enough to not smoke, that's great.  Maybe sometime she would like to try something like the AIO so she can have more choices of flavors, nicotine level, save a few bucks in the long run.  From what I understand, the juul is very high in nicotine, and on the expensive side.  But it's not like your grandma needs to blowing huge clouds.  Unless she wants to!
p1149
aVImo a juul is a great device. Only problem I had with it was it was just too much nic for me
p1150
aVAnything is better than a cigarette, my friend!\u000a\u000aIt's true there are better devices than the JUUL but they come with a price and require research. You've done a great thing. If she keeps it up do the research and spend on a much better device.\u000a\u000aThe JUUL will do for now. :)
p1151
aVHave you considered a Juul? I use it when I'm doing load in/out days and it suit me just fine. Super stealthy and hits nice!

aVJust picked up the JUUL and so far it's been great!

aVJuul. [See this thread](/r/Vaping/comments/4qtpc7/today_marks_one_month_without_a_cig_all_thanks_to/) for more info. 
p1154
aVI cannot recommend the Juul enough! I have been of cogs for a month with it! Super cheap, super reliable
p1155
aVIt's called the JUUL. Each cartridge is the equivalent of 2 packs of cigarettes.
p1156
aVThis is the JUUL. I love the simplicity of this device. Each cartridge is the equivalent of 2 packs of cigarettes.\u000a\u000aI bought one for myself and one for my best friend. I vaped for awhile before and had a few mods.\u000a\u000aThese mods (sigelei 150 and tfv4) pushed her away. She had no interest in the vapor production. She just wanted to quit, as did I.\u000a\u000aWhen I stumbled upon the Juul, it was an answer to prayer. \u000a\u000aThanks to that after 7+ years of smoking, she is 2 weeks without a single cigarette!! \u000a\u000aI am so thankful for this little guy!
p1157
aVYou say that, but Juul groups are chock full of juice and mod makers who have been in the game for 3+ years.\u000a\u000aIf the goal is a nic fix with the least possible amount of fuss, nothing really comes close to the Juul.
p1158
aVCongrats! Hitting a juul is so satisfying but I got rid of mine for a bigger device. The pods are a bit expensive and I wanted to lower my nic intake and unfortunately they don't make pods with less nic
p1159
aVHmmm, you're making me think I should buy my dad a Juul. He has a VTC Mini and a Vengeance tank, and he hasn't touched it in months, so he's back on the stinkys.
p1160
aVlove my juul. had it for almost a year now and it's still going strong
p1161
aVI definitely feel the Juul is a better quitting device for avid cigarette smokers than a typical vape mod. Especially since you can hold it like a cig and has a much much sharper hit than a box mod etc. I love taking it to the bars when I don't feel like lugging around a box mod or have everyone wanting to "chuck some clouds bruh" with my mod. 
p1162
aVThese things rock, we just got them in our shop recently and a lot of older people don't want anything big or complicated and we've only had pen styles that they had to refill and buy new coils for. We have a lot of trouble with older customers they hate doing all that but we've only had what we had. Until the Juul and all its beauty, we personally tried them being people that use mods and drippers and were amazed. Simple, small, packs the punch you need and you can still buy premium liquid to refill cartridges if that doesn't bother you or just buy refills. Definitely recommend these to anyone trying to quit smoking but don't want anything crazy. 
p1163
aVI used a juul too till I found out about sub ohm vapes and what not. Damn thing is the best of its class. BTW you can refill the cartridges with whatever ejuice Ya got. I put some 80/20 in it and it vaped great just killed the coil sooner though.
p1164
aVCongrats. I've spent a ton of money on mods and juices and coils. It's all a huge waste of money. Making big clouds gets old fast. The object is to quit. I dropped all that flashy stuff and went back to Blu. They are much more like a cigarette than the cloud makers. I did try Juul as well. And I did like them. My only issue with them was the short battery life. Puffing on a Blu Pina Colada right now. again, congrats to you both. 
p1165
aVHell yeah. This thing is awesome. For reference purposes, I have every type of device and atomizer you can think of. A couple mechs, VTC mini, Cuboid, CF4TC100, 2 AIOs, a T18, a T22, Subvod. Several RDAs, both Griffins, a Subtank Mini, Joyetech's shitty eGo One Mega tank, a Crown, an Arctic V8, the iSub tank. \u000a\u000aMy daily driver is the AIO, but the Juul is perfect for taking with me when I go out with friends. I recently used one after a 10-hour flight. It hit me like a freight train, just like a cigarette would have back in the day. \u000a\u000aHave you tried waving it around after taking a drag? Look at the LED when you do. 
p1166
aVJuuls are awesome especially if you're into the whole every day carry scene.
p1167
aVWhat are your thoughts on the Juul? Pros and cons.
p1168
aVPros - Sexy stealth package that will never feel like a burden in your pocket or in a strangers face on the street; best throat hit for an e-cig alike (and only cigalike I've ever tolerated let alone incorporated so heavily into my routine). Passable flavors (20+ better ones were tested, but not released yet if ever according to their mum "outreach" team members I've talked to. This might turn into a dealbreaker for me as if I am stuck with this shit tobacco or crem brulee as my only options at 5% nic I might not be using it as much soon. The flavor fatigue on these first four flavors is very real). Extremely potent nic delivery that rivals the spike you get from a real cig [like so](https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/pax-evaluation.png), probably because of the "nic salts" instead of freebase (normal ecig juice) and benzoic acid make this even better for being discrete and not needing too much clouds/puffs to get yer fix.\u000a\u000aCons - Only one nic strength that may be too much for some (they had a spectrum of different nic strengths available for test and when they were out they left a gaping hole in my preferences). Some pods leak (though customer service is great and will replace them). If you don't want MTL vapes, this isn't for you. Some people claim pods are refillable, but this is a dubious claim at best as the atomizer craps out after a few uses anyways and any juice you put in there is not going to match the experience of JUUL juice (which is half the battle for this device for me honestly), while also probably leaking. Last con is the company has been fairly tight-lipped about any plans for their future or test results of options people have been requesting. They'll just point you to a newsletter that has probably gone out once in the 2016 calendar year asking if my dad smokes. Signing up for it will net you a 25% discount on their site, though (not insignificant, especially since its the cheapest place to buy pods that I know about). \u000a\u000aFor such a game-changing device for me personally I just wish they'd up the engagement level a bit. No point in having social media accounts if they are just to facilitate mint restocks.\u000a\u000a
p1169
aVJUUL
p1170
aV/r/vaporents or /r/waxpen, I don't think any of these do e-liquid.  If they come out with a new Juul though I'd be interested.
p1171
aVI talked with a pax rep a while back, apparently they're going to try to come out with juul brand e-liquid. I'm not sure how they're going about it now with the ban and all but he said that the market was growing and they, "really want a piece of that action," his words. The then gave me a free juul and a free shirt. This was back when I worked in a smoke shop.
p1172
aVI usually keep the dock in my car and plug it into the 12v, kinda looks like it was built into the dash. The battery does die a bit too soon though. Maybe if they released a new Juul with games like they have on the pax 2. With refillable carts.
p1173
aVMy terrible experience with the JUUL by PAX
p1174
aVIdk what to tell you I use mine everyday and have never had a single problem with leaking or anything.  I've had pods for local stores, juul and eBay and all have been fine. 
p1175
aV42mg? Was he running a dripper/sub ohm tank or was it out of a lower power set up? IIRC the Juul is 50mg and really low power and most people I know cannot chain hits off it without getting messed up real quick. 
p1176
aVThe mini volt is great for stuff like that Or get a juul. Love mine. 
p1177
aVI've heard only good about juul, but it's MTL right?
p1178
aVOn my desk at the moment are Cloupor Mini+/Kayfun Mini V3, Ego AIO, Juul, IPV D2/Griffin, Mini Volt/Nautilus X and Kilo Edition SnowWolf Mini/Serpent Mini
p1179
aVJuul is the only cigalike I've ever found to be useful.
p1180
aVI originally quit using Blu, almost went back to smoking but luckily went to a vape shop and got a better setup instead.  Blu aren't very good.  Juul is really good if you want a cig like experience but none of the other cigalikes are very good in my experience, might get you by for a while if you needed something really small though and Juul isn't available in your country since they're U.S. only right now.
p1181
aVIf juul makes it out the gate I'll pretty pleased. 
p1182
aVI have buuen using a Juul for a couple weeks. and sometimes in the morning when I use it, I get a traditional heavy nicotine rush. no ecig has ever done this for me. is it because of the different way they use the nicotine (salt vs. freebase) or the unusually high (5%) nix volume.
p1183
aVI'd say it's because of the amount of nicotine. I used to have a juul and it's honestly really nice for a e cig but the pods are expensive ($17 where I live for a pack of 4) and it's too much nicotine imo 
p1184
aVWhat do you think about the Juul?
p1185
aVYou could check out the Juul, try starting out with that, it's a little over 50 mg/ml and definitely provides quite the nic hit, based on your habits it might be expensive though to go through a few of those pods a day but I guess probably not more expensive than 3 packs a day of smokes.  After you get off the cigs you could work your way down later but definitely get off 3 packs a day, I can't even imagine what that's doing to your body.
p1186
aVSo a few days ago someone asked me to post the pocket mods I used because I described a few.  So here they all are for size comparison purposes.\u000a\u000aFrom Left to Right:\u000a\u000aGoblin Nano on COV Mini Volt\u000a\u000aJuul by Pax\u000a\u000aAspire Plato w/ Triton Mini 1.8 ohm clapton coils\u000a\u000aEgo AIO\u000a\u000aKayfun Mini V3 on Cloupor Mini +\u000a\u000aT-18 Prism Tank on Cloupor Mini 30w\u000a\u000aNautilus Mini on Tesla Two\u000a\u000aGriffin on IPV D2\u000a\u000a30 ML bottle for size reference.\u000a\u000aLately I've usually been carrying the Kayfun Mini V3 or the Griffin combo and the AIO in the other pocket.
p1187
aVNoticed a juul there. I think it's the best cig like device.I've been putting 50/50 ejuice in the cartridge and it gives even more vapor.
p1188
aVI do the same basically. I use the juul when I'm outside my work van and my mod when I'm in it. As for the pods I had same leak problem at first with high vg but when I changed to 50/50 didn't give me probs .don't know if you filled it the same way but I pull the black cap off then pull out the rubber stopper ,fill and put it all back on. Lasts a half week before I burn out the coil. :)
p1189
aVLast cool rebuild ever:( tomorrow I will be a proud owner of the Juul.
p1190
aVJuul works great for a quick nic fix, don't use that thing like you do your Subtank though, it's a TON of nic, 50mg/ml.  The cartridges also are only .75 ml so you can go through them quick without realizing it and they cost $4 a piece.  I use them for work when I'm going to be at customer sites and don't want to be pulling out a box mod but I'd imagine it would be quite expensive as a solo device.  It would be nice if you could refill them, I've tried but never found any juice they could take that wouldn't flood and leak like crazy.
p1191
aVDon't quite understand how one could choose something like the Juul over a full-sized RTA or a normal tank... There are just so many limitations coming with the Juul.\u000aIf it's only for not needing to build no more coils, then why not a normal tank?
p1192
aVHow is the juul much stronger? Just curious... Last I checked, couldn't you just build a higher ohm coil, go mouth to lung and raise your nic content?
p1193
aVJust picked up this thing. It is called juul. Check it out, it's unreal.
p1194
aVThe USB Charger on the Juul destroyed my hard-drive
p1195
aVJuul seems pretty well regarded here as far as cigalikes go (I haven't tried it). https://www.juulvapor.com/\u000a\u000aStill, the best way to start is an eVic VTC Mini starter kit.
p1196
aVThe juul I'm not sure if you would call is "disposable" but it is and your best bet for sure. 
p1197
aVInnokin Endura T18.  It was designed around the idea to transfer smokers to vaping.  Not too much power.  Comfortable mouth to lung inhale (mimics smoking).  Easy to fill tank.  Very high quality vape for a "starter" setup.  Or the Juul if you want something smaller (almost like a very high quailty cigalike).
p1198
aVthe pax juul IMO. very high on nicotine though
p1199
aVNah just get a juul. They have like 50 nic, so no clouds just the buzz. That's what I use at work
p1200
aVThe JUUL!
p1201
aVAgree, it was my first 'real' mod (my first was a juul-esque unregulated device), and I've loved it so far.

p1207
aVJUUL. Looks like a USB drive. Not customizable unfortunately. 
p1208
aVYou're not really supposed to use salt nicotine e juice on a rda or other sub-ohm device. This is because usually too much power is running through it for high concentrations of nicotine and you need to be careful about overdoing it. Salt nicotine e juice are meant for devices like the sourin air, juno, juul, etc. You can find many of these devices in vape shops or online. The key difference between one of these devices and your rda is that the ohms (resistance) is much higher and the power is much power. This let's the device have a harder pull so it feels more similar to a cigarette. Useful for people trying to quit. I would not recommend using salt nicotine e juice on an rda, that just sounds like trouble if you ask me. 
p1209
aVJuul's spontaneous popularity
p1210
aVIdk when specifically but it sucks that so many youngins use it to get \u201cbuzzed.\u201d Although, it is better than smoking, so that\u2019s the only bright side. It was instrumental in getting me to quit. The product works for this purpose. (As much as I hate to say it, because JUul isn\u2019t very \u201cvape community\u201d friendly.) 
p1211
aVYeah, definitely this, you can legit JUUL anywhere and get away with it.  The \u201cclouds\u201d almost dissipate instantly, and you get your nic fix quickly(Not condoning Vaping where you\u2019re not supposed to smoke, just stating that it can be done with this device).
p1212
aVI'm a college student and a weed smoker. Some of my friends enjoy mixing weed and tobacco (chops, mokes, moles, spliffs, etc.) and want to stop using straight up T, so they bought Juuls to get their nic fix. They're easy to hide and use because of the pod system, but I prefer my mod. You can't control the strength of the nic which is a draw for some people because they're used to the strength of cigs, but a turnoff for me since I'm sensitive to nic and prefer 3mg juice. 
p1213
aVWhat do you mean by this? I\u2019m a pack a day smoker and was looking into switching to the Juul. 
p1214
aVI quit smoking instantly with the JUUL, it was so much better than this blu ecigs or any other cigalike that I tried, because I didn\u2019t really want to become a \u201cVaper\u201d with a huge mod and all that stuff... but then I tried an AIO device, then I got a nicer AIO device... then I got a pico, then and alien, then a Battlestar, then a mech, and attys galore... and more mods... but I haven\u2019t had a cigarette since the first time puffing on a juul.
p1215
aVPicked up a Juul for the same reason. Stay strong man. 
p1216
aVHey did you figure something out. ? I'm trying to mix it with trgulat strength juul nic salt.
p1217
aVmay as well use it as an excuse to scope out a juul ¯\u005c\u005c_(\u30c4)_/¯ 
p1218
aVI was told the Endura T20S is great for MTL vaping. But it is a vape pen, not a small box mod. Glad to know that the coil lasts. I will put it in my wish list and JUUL or Breeze delete. Yesterday someone says they do not provide much flavor. 
p1219
aVLuggage being shipped to Singapore with Juul pods???
p1220
aVModding then twelve Juno to use juul pods?
p1221
aVGet a mini-MTL like the iCare, Breeze or Juul.\u000a\u000a\u000aYes you have to pay for coils or pre-filled pods, but a pack of coils is not that much more than a pack of smokes.\u000a\u000a\u000aLow initial investment and with iCsre or Breeze you can use regular juice.\u000a\u000a\u000aI started with an Envii Fitt and that got me through two weeks. Eventually the B&amp;M near work didn't have   pods so I bought a Breeze so I could refill juice and swap coils. After awhile of not smoking then you can get into the fancy stuff, but step one is one day with no cigarettes.
p1222
aVTry the Juul
p1223
aVGL, try the juul!
p1224
aVTry looking into a juul or other salt based nicotine device. Because it's much higher in nicotine than a traditional cloud blowing vape it can give you that sharp buzz of nic that cigs give you. I smoked and vaped for a few years but I quit cigs in August with the help of my juul. Good luck buddy :)
p1225
aVtry a juul
p1226
aVIm a recent cigarette quitter. I started with the juul and eventually moved to a sub ohm. I find the regular juice far less satisfying than the juuls nic salt and big throat hit.  But most days I can get by on normal juice. \u000a\u000aAnyways i would get a juul and the tobbaco pods. Those really squash cig cravings for me. Give it a few days of just juul and no cigs and you should be able to quit without a huge struggle. 
p1227
aVThanks for the help, I'll look into the juul. :)
p1228
aVJuul Help...
p1229
aVLook up how to clean juul battery. You can push the sled that holds everything out of the case by pushing down the top with a flathead screwdriver or something. From there clean it all up and put it back in. Make sure led is facing the right way. I have to do this every week or so with mine 
p1230
aVHonestly I did, then I got a Juul and it helped curbing it until the nic in my vape juice took over 
p1231
aVThe Juul uses a consolidated pod which has about the same amount of nic as a pack of cigarettes, it\u2019s much easier if you look it up 
p1232
aVI agree, I recently got an xfire which is essentially a smaller and cheaper juul. It's been great, I can take it to work and stealthily hit it, get where I wanna be in just one or two hits, and then pocket it and be chill for an hour or two. Perfect for work or for taking around in public.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMy main mod now only gets used in my car or at home.

aVJuul device recall
p1235
aVI've went through quite a few mtl devices like the breeze.\u000a\u000a\u000a-Limitless pulse is a great pod pen that is basically a long juul that is refillable.\u000a\u000a-Icare2 is a pretty good mtl that is a great upgrade to the 1 despite having iffy coils\u000a\u000a-Vaporesso Aurora is a nifty zippo like mtl that looks like a slightly bigger zippo lighter\u000a\u000a-Phix is kinda garbage and tried to live off the juul hype but due to overpriced pods and difficult refilling the prejuiced pods I can't recommend it\u000a\u000a-Suorin Air is my current mtl nic salt mod and I really like it. Basically a thicker credit card with auto pull but I have heard mixed reviews about the coils.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAll of these I can add more to but I'm on mobile and didn't want to type forever for no reason.
p1236
aVIf I was to recommend anything to a starter you could either go the route of a All in one system (means the battery, tank, and mod is all one unit) such as a Aspire Breeze, juul, or suorin air. Buttttttt I would strongly suggest getting a Smoant Charon and a Crown III tank. You will need to buy batteries and a battery charger tho (which may not be the route you wish to take at this early of a stage)\u000a\u000aI would suggest going to YouTube and searching \u201cAIO vape mod\u201d and starting from there. YouTube is your best friend in this situation.\u000a\u000aElement vape \u000aVaporDNA \u000aThose are two very good sites\u000a
p1237
aVNp. Head over to the sidebar of r/electronic_cigarette for more useful links. Most beginners are recommended with vape pens (all in ones) or pods (juul, suorin, etc) for starters. Try to avoid Smok products. Though some may have good experiences with them, a lot of threads with issues have been and still being posted. With their mass production comes with poor/unreliable quality. GL!
p1238
aVGet a Juul man. The cartridges are disposable and you keep the same little stick without wasting batteries.
p1239
aVA JUUL would be great for you, or any of the pod likes will be great. 
p1240
aVI got a vape to stop juuling since it was so high in nicotine
p1241
aVThe myjet or limitless pulse is very similar to the juul except you fill the pods with whatever juice you want. The myjet has a cool external battery pack that really boosts battery life. 
p1242
aVYou can refill your Juul pods with 6 mg nic.
p1243
aVSunset on the Red Sea, 1st vape handcheck. The girlfriend just bought me an upgrade for when I get home! The JUUL litterally stopped working after finishing the pod in the picture. Can\u2019t wait for the upgrade
p1244
aVThen get a juul 
p1245
aVJuul, penguin, or a Phix would be a good next step
p1246
aVThere's also a similar product to the JUUL called the Phix. They both work pretty much the same and are about the same size, but with different designs and names.
p1247
aVThe T Priv haha I should\u2019ve clarified. I\u2019ve had the Juul since about late September and it definitely helped me quit the habit, but I\u2019ve always wanted to get my hands on a nicer mod that I can actually tinker with a little bit and today was the day.
p1248
aVIt is very heavy, I was shocked. But I am used to carrying the Juul around which is like a usb stick haha
p1249
aVIt looks like a phix to me they are pretty comparable to a juul 
p1250
aVHow do the bo pods taste in comparison to juuls?
p1251
aVEvery Bo pod that ive had has been really gross, the cotton seems to burn instantly on all the pods and the flavors have a really bad feel to them. I just switched to juul a month ago and like it way better 
p1252
aVFirst off, regardless of which approach to vaping you take, I hope you\u2019re successful in quitting! That being said, there\u2019s a lot of different products in the vape world. Regular vape juice is freebase nicotine, instead of nic salt-base like is in cigarettes, naturally occurs in dip, and the Juul. The Juul runs off pods that have a salt-based nic so it\u2019s supposedly closer to the sensation you get from the nic in cigarettes and dip. Might want to look into that a bit if regular juice doesn\u2019t work out the best for you. 
p1253
aVNot sure if juul or wifi antenna in background.... 
p1254
aVAspire breeze. Innokin t18 or t20. Juul. Boulder rock. 
p1255
aVGo with the JUUL...best device out there today if you want to quit smoking...their pods are loaded with 50mg of nicotine in 0.7 ml of liquid!
p1256
aVThe Juul and Suprin Air are both really good. I like the Suorin better because I think it\u2019s a lot cheaper and you can use your own juice. (Salt nic)
p1257
aVIMO the juul feels less than 50mg for me. When I refill my pods with salt e (45 mg) I get a greater buzz.
p1258
aVI dropped my juul in my e brake housing yesterday. That was a first. 
p1259
aVif you are wanting something small I would say a phix which is really just a bigger version of the juul but I would say the best thing to do is just go into a local shop and look at some starter kits they have so u can actually look and hold them things like that and see if it is something that your brother would like. There area ton of starters out there now that dont cost a ton just the matter of finding the right one that is right for you. I am sure that there is someone that can help you more then I can. Still new to vaping but when I started I just went into a shop and sat down with someone there and they answered all my questions and really helped me out.
p1260
aVTry the Juul. $40 for the pen. Strong pods (50mg of Nicotine) and they\u2019re pretty much fool proof.
p1261
aVAnyone know of a vape that\u2019s its like the JUUL but with far less nicotine?
p1262
aVYou can find stealthy vapes that use the regular 3mg-12mg juice. The icare mini is an example. It's a bit larger than the JUUL, but it's still very small. 
p1263
aVI\u2019m a fucking fiend. I carry them in a bag with my batteries and tons of juice, which stays in the car. \u000a\u000aI\u2019ll select the appropriate vape for whatever situation arises. \u000a\u000aIf I\u2019m on campus, I\u2019ll take my aspire breeze (not pictured) for discretion. At work I\u2019ll take my 20700 devices as I\u2019m allowed to fog the place out however I please. If I\u2019m boolin at the club I\u2019ll take my G-Priv, set that bitch\u2019s lights on Rainbow Fade and destroy the masculinity of Juul users. \u000a\u000aWhen I\u2019m in the privacy of my own home, I do whatever I want; series boxes, my old Kanger Five6, etc.\u000a\u000aI have so many vapes. I have no idea what to do with this Wismec gen3. \u000a\u000aBut short answer, yeah, my guy.

aVThere are so many better and cheaper alternatives to a juul. If you\u2019re interested in pod system vaporizers with high levels of nicotene, check out the limitless pulse, aspire brez, or even the phix. And as for the juice, Mr salt eliquid is fairly cheap and it is salt based (also know as nicotene in its acidic form) from 25-45mg.  
p1265
aVHell yeah man and it\u2019s my girl friends. I\u2019m more of a mod guy my self. But the juul is nice when I can chuck clouds 
p1266
aVI will swear by the Juul for the foreseeable future as a device for someone to stop smoking.
p1267
aVjuul is no better than disposables that were around in gas stations 5 years ago, incredibly unsatisfying, but if it works for you then that's all that matters.
p1268
aVI think it works fine for getting right off cigarettes but I just can't imagine using it for a sustained period of time. Most people that I know that did use juul eventually went the way of stronger devices and either continue to use those or quit entirely. The pods are expensive, flavor is weak and limited options, and the hit is too throaty for me considering the high PG/VG ratio. 
p1269
aVWell heres how the wife uses it. The juul covers her nic cravings due to the high nic content. For the hand to mouth she uses an obs engine with 3mg nic juice.\u000a\u000aThis helped her quit. Because a subohm tank was to much. The vapor made her cough, etc. Like it will anyone who is quitting. The juul is very close to a cig and packs a big dose of nic. Once she got to where vapor didnt make her cough, then she could back down the use of the juul and uses the sub ohm tank for most of the time. Only hitting the juul when nic craving get to be to much.\u000aIf her minikin/engine were lost busted, she would be chill until we replaced it.\u000aBut panic mode would ensue if something happened to her juul heh.\u000a\u000a
p1270
aVHeating a juuls outer case
p1271
aVI have a friend that moves juuls and pods, when I asked him about taking the outer case off, he said that it is much harder to do with newer juul designs. There are probably new youtube videos on how to do it, but its not as easy as it used to be.
p1272
aVI remember where I worked people came in asking for either Naked juice or Juul pods a lot of the time. We didn't carry either.
p1273
aVThe purple Minikin is awesome!! I love my setup with the OBS engine. The Juul is my baby though. I smoked for 30 years and tried to quit a million times and the Juul is what made it happen. 
p1274
aVI'd recommend a juul, not my style personally , but it's compact, holds a long charge, and has a lot of different flavor options. But If you're looking for something with a bit more customization, then something like a smok stick. That way you could change out the juices, coils, etc .
p1275
aVThanks for the suggestion. I\u2019ve talked to a few people in my area about the juul, looked fight up my alley, only problem is that they are having serious trouble getting the replacement parts? I (am new to this) can\u2019t remember what they are called but they look like filters for the eliquid, the guy I bought my breeze from said he hasn\u2019t been able to get that part for the juul in 3 months. Didn\u2019t want to risk it. \u000a\u000aIf you don\u2019t mind, tell me more about the smok stick? I don\u2019t need to be able to customize too much, im just gonna get the black and be done with it. Have you or someone you know used it? 
p1276
aVA lot of my friends have been using juuls and they seem to work pretty well. I think if you can get him something that is nicotine salts it'll be perfect small, long lasting battery and a great mouth to lung hit if you need any more info you can pm me but you should definitely look into a juul or a juno it's what I've been trying to get my mom to use!
p1277
aVEither a juul or a sourin air. The air is nice cause you put your own juice in it and aren't stuck paying way more for packs of pods. Me salt e has great juice for the device as well.
p1278
aV\u000aDoes it use proprietary pods like the Juul? Or can you use your own eliquid?
p1279
aVI\u2019m returning to the game after a 5 month juul switch. Question about staggered fused Clapton
p1280
aVThe downvotes because your bassically hating on the improvement of technology then bashing it because its not the way you wanted it to improve. Not every vape now and days is a big 8lb hunk of pipe those would be called mech mods and theyve been around since the beginning. Not everbody wants a mod with controls and finnicky menu systems and they have options for those people now like the pod vapes or single button mods like the joyetech penguin or eleaf icare v2 or juuls. but some people like to have the option to make there vape hotter or cooler or use tempature control mode because thats what they enjoy and its what's helped them get off cigarettes. Not everybody wants a small device they can put in there shirt pocket and not everybody wants a big mod that will weigh there pants down but for those who do there are plenty of options weve came so far from where we were in previous years. If you want to use a 3.7v pen with an aspire mini nova tank then thats your choice and nobody is will hate on you because of it because vaping is a great alternative to smoking and has saved so many lives over the years and people arnt worried about how expensive or new your setup is along as your staying away from tobacco. \u000a\u000aNow to awnser the question you asked where can you get ye old pens? Well your in luck discountvapers.com has been around for longer than ive been vaping and the majority of devices they sell are 2013 or older. 
p1281
aVNot everybody likes vaping at 15watts. I know I didn't when I first started vaping. I eventually went back to cigarettes. Only once I could vape at 80w+ was I satisfied with vaping. Vaping at higher wattage means more power is required, which means larger batteries, sometimes two or three of them.\u000a\u000a I would say most people on Reddit that vape have a device capable of 75w or more and maybe that's why you don't think that vaping has gone in the direction you prefer. But you're just plain wrong. \u000a\u000aNic salts are fairly new to the mainstream and allow those low watt devices to push a lot of nicotine at low power. Juul, sourin air, mi-one, sourin drop all take nic salts. And even if nicotine isn't your thing and that doesn't matter there are plenty of stealth mods that you could fit in the palm of your hand that aren't designed for nic salt.\u000a\u000aSo the reason you're getting downvoted is because you didn't bother to do any type of research before complaining.
p1282
aVTry a Juul or juno pod system. Or a salt nic base. I use 30mg Solace in an Endura T20 and it let's you get your fix with like 3 rips instead of constantly ripping a box mod or something. It's mtl which is good for a new vaper. 
p1283
aVit\u2019s pretty good, i use it for stealth and on the go and it\u2019s fairly effective. i like it more than the juul personally. 
p1284
aVIf you're looking for something similar to a cigarette, the highest end you coukd go with is a Juul. They're an MTL hit, and give you your nicotine cravings. If you're going for more of a mod of somr sort I'd go with a Smok stick V8 (I know, they get a ton of shit, but my smok stick has lasted me years.) or another stick-lile kit. 
p1285
aVYeah i\u2019m using a juul type thing called a juno and i quit smoking cigs. It\u2019s good they have menthol and tobacco flav juice pods

p1288
aVYouTube is your best friend. But I agree with the post above me in recommending a juul. It\u2019s a great cig replacement 
p1289
aVFor sure- I'm gonna see what I can find on there this weekend. Thanks! And I've heard the Juul is great, from several people- both on here and through friends. What makes it such a great cig replacement? 
p1290
aVThe throat hit is damn near identical to a cig. I haven\u2019t smoked for 2 years but damn does the juul hit like a cig. Multiple friends of mine used them to quit
p1291
aVGet a Juul they kick your nic cravings out of the window.
p1292
aVI'd reccomend a Juul I could never do nic vapes before I tried it. Nic vapes always tasted like crap to me too.. just use a Juul for your nic fix and keep vaping 0mg on your mod(:
p1293
aVIf you want to quit tobacco, try getting a phix or a Juul. Higher nicotine and has the same throat hit as a cigarette; it's definitely helped me a lot! 
p1294
aVHalf the people i recommend this to. The other half i recommend getting rid of all their old stuff and getting a juul or something mi one. Some old smokers really arent into the whole building scene and just want something simple.
p1295
aVFuck this building buying work more shit. If you're a habitual smoker you have to treat it as such - replace your smoke breaks with vape breaks. Dont just vape freely all day like most of us do. Now if u need a real nicotine kick just up the nic and keep it as a "smoke break"\u000a\u000a\u000aFind a setup that works for YOU. Do u like the idea of vaping as a habit? Look into rebuilding! Do you want the most basic, convenient cigalike? Try a juul! Do you want an in between with cool flavors? Your mod right now works!\u000a\u000a\u000aMain thing is, vaping can become a secondary source of excess nicotine if you dont treat it as a "replacement therapy" as it's meant to.

aVI only make these jokes because iCare. Juul understand what Im talking about soon enough.
p1307
aVGood choice my dude! Looking into nic salts lately, should I go with this or the juul?
p1308
aVI've tried both the Juul and the Breeze. I really like both but the Breeze is very convenient as you can buy normal juice bottle for refills. The juul uses proprietary juice pods. Whatever you choose will be a good choice ;) 
p1309
aVGood non-Propylene Glycol juices for Juul?
p1310
aVGot good and bad news for you. \u000a\u000aGood first: You can get 100% VG juices! You just may have to DIY. If you can stomach just a little PG, tons of online juice sellers carry \u2018max VG\u2019 options which is generally 80-90% VG. \u000a\u000aBad news second: It\u2019s not gonna work in your Juul. The reason the Juul and other MTL devices use PG is it has a very low viscosity, and wicks easily. Max VG has an extremely low viscosity and needs to be used on a dripper or specific type of tank. 
p1311
aVMore good news: you can DIY a juice with practically no PG. Bad news: to use in a Juul, you need to replace the PG with PDO or PEG 400. Those can be a bit of a hassle to get, but not much more of a problem than flavor concentrates that don't use PG.  
p1312
aVAh, thanks had a hard time with that since I just switched from a juul to the Boulder and the juul always gave me like .5 strength so I was confused 
p1313
aV 45 mg. Juul is 50mg. Mr. Salte is some of the best 
p1314
aVI can't judge based on the JUul, never used it.  But I was around a 2 pack a day guy and the 12 did me pretty good.  I'd suggest trying out a couple 15ml bottles of each and dial in your comfort level.

aVBreeze for sure. Similar to the iCare, but better quality. Plus you don't need to press any buttons, just straight pull like the Juul. And they're the same price!
p1320
aVHad a JUUL, now I just run 25mg nic salt ejuice in a Nautilus 2 on top of a Innokin CoolFire Mini with 1.6 Ohm coils. Works wonders, saved me cash, and fits comfortably in my pocket always even while at work.

aVJuul vs. PHIX
p1322
aVJuul is a lot more reliable and is smaller if that appeals to you 
p1323
aVI\u2019ve had both so I can inform you on things with these two. First off with the pods, the Juul has way better flavor and the pods are cheaper, but they contain almost 1ml less than Phix pods. The juul has a smoother delivery while the phix hits harsher, but both give you that instant chill effect. Juul is smaller, phix is bigger. Juul is also louder when drawing, if that matters at all to you. I prefer the Juul over the Phix but either one is a good choice. 
p1324
aVAnybody know how to refill Juno/Juul pods with your own juice?
p1325
aVThanks I'll check that out. I was looking into the juul because of its nice size but that thing is way to much nic for me.
p1326
aVHonestly it's flavor is much better then the Big Baby Beast I have used on a different mod. It also hits really hard but with good airflow. The Juul has been my go to for a while and the Tfv12 that I was using was not a good alternative neither was the Big Baby Beast. I only use 3mg juice and this tank is super satisfying
p1327
aVHas anyone tried putting Juul e juice in a regular vape?
p1328
aVVoltage under 10 is still crazy. Juul liquid is more than double the strength of anything you're supposed to put in a sub ohm setup. Just be careful. 
p1329
aVJuul or Juno?
p1330
aVNo, but I hear with the new TFV256 Incestual Son of Dragon Lord you can buy attachments to put pods in it.  The one deck allows for up to 6 Juul pods to be attached, allowing you to take as many as two pulls!
p1331
aVI like it a lot. I bought it for when I'm stressed at work and need a quick fix and it does the job. Had a juul too but I like the air a lot better.
p1332
aVGet a juul, sourin air, or sourin drop. Use nicotine salts. You will not want cigs anymore. 50mg. 
p1333
aVSounds like pods are for you. Please **don't** get any Smok products. Though I have not used one, I would suggest Phix, Juul or Sourin Air. I'm sure the more experienced ones will chime in.
p1334
aVWhat mod?  Also how do you like that berserker. I\u2019ve been looking at them but don\u2019t really understand how the mil works with a big tank. Have only used sub ohm tanks but used to use the Juul pretty regularly and miss that tight draw.

p1339
aVIt\u2019s just frustrating because how could I be a 17 year pack a day smoker. Who chain smoked and get nic sick all of a sudden? Is the nicotine in cigarettes that different? Also I had been using the JUul for about a month. Why didn\u2019t that happen before? Maybe just the perfect storm of occurrence? 
p1340
aVthat's understandable, almost all parents when you're younger don't want you to inhale nothing, they try and control what you do. \u000apersonally after I quit smoking pot I felt the same way; I needed to puff on something to help mimic smoking weed, my parents don't really care, yet I've never done it infront of them; and they don't search my room or personal space. \u000aI guess in your current state, you should maybe not get a mod and tank, especially when it's a lot of items to keep hidden from your mom. \u000amaybe you should buy a baton, or a breeze or something like the Juuls, not necessarily a juul since those are expensive, but a nice MTL vape pen will work, especially since that's really small, and all you need is salt nic juice, which you can buy anywhere and just hide the juice really well, keep the extra pods in like a old shoe box or somewhere hidden,  and keep the vape pen in your pockets or something, don't leave it lying around ever. \u000ayou should be fine if you can get your hands on a small MTL vape pen since those are inconspicuous and you can always just say it's a " power bank " if anyone asks. 
p1341
aVGet a juul. High nic to kill the nic cravings. Then use your snow wolf and smm for the hand to mouth of it. Make sure and use low nic juice(3) for the smm.\u000aThis worked like a champ for my wife. She still does this as a matter of fact.
p1342
aVI agree. I have the Juul and the Suorin Air and that's what did it for me. They both use nic salts which much more resemble the hit off a cigarette and allow higher nic without being too harsh.\u000a\u000aStill use my regular mod but any time I get a BAD craving, I take a few rips off my juul or air and I'm good to go.

aVImaging integrating a Juul type of setup into a cell phone.

aVI've found they don't really care if you have a Juul style, but I wouldn't really even think about pulling out an actual mod at the bar. No matter what the vape smells like, people tend to not like a cloud of anything in their face unless they're the one producing it.
p1345
aVNeed to quit juul.
p1346
aVI mean as an athlete i haven't noticed a difference in my performance i have been smoking my juul for about a month
p1347
aV2 pods a day is pretty intense, thats a LOT of nicotine. It takes me about 2-3 days to get through 1 pod as a recent convert from smoking. Its soooo strong with the high nic i cf t take more than 1-3 puffs at a time.  \u000a\u000aId try to start a lower nic juice. I think one of the juul lookalike devices has 5 and 2.5% juice catridges. Maybe that would be an option. 
p1348
aVMight try out the 2.5, do you recall the name? I rip the juul all day and only get a real head buzz on the first drag when I wake up.
p1349
aVThe mi one or mi pod is a good option if you want something small. Even the limitless pulse is similar to the Juul but the pods are refillable up to 8-10 times. 
p1350
aVSorry i dont recall. Saw it on YouTube tho. \u000a\u000aA start might also be to just try and limit yourself to one cartridge a day.  Im personally switching to a refillable mod soon so i can buy low nic juice. I feel the addiction sinking jn with the juul and i use it a little more every day.  I feel lime to me its even more addictive than smoking was if thats possible. 
p1351
aVi +1 this\u000a\u000asuorin air is the only thing that i was able to stop juuling with

aVThe 30mg juices use nic salts and are made for pod systems like the Juul or MyJet, not for sub-ohm tanks. U don't wanna vape that stuff in a regular tank, it's meant for MTL really

aVClosed system means you have to buy cartridges/pods pre-filled and can't refill them yourself.\u000a\u000aAnything designed to have the end user put juice into is an open system vape. \u000a\u000aMost things sold at vape shops will be open system except Juul, Njoy, and similar.\u000a\u000aAsk "Show me how to refill it" and if they show you pre-filled cartridgs/pods, that's a closed system.
p1368
aVJust picked one up today. I\u2019ve been using the Juul on and off for almost a year now because of the convenience and it has by far my favorite nicotine level out of any vape I\u2019ve tried. It\u2019s super weird that I can\u2019t find anything about the Ciro online though, the package really has minimal info about the product. How do you check how charged it is while using it? Does anyone know what the actual nicotine amount is? I\u2019ve only tried the nectar flavor so far, the cartridge seems to be going fairly fast but I definitely enjoy how much flavor you get from it along with how smooth it hits. 
p1369
aVthey aren\u2019t lying. i watch them do it. i go in with my best friend to buy 50mg nic salt juice with him. i know for a fact that they chain vape 45-50 all day for a month or two and they can quit anytime they want because i\u2019ve seen friends of mine quit. they use juuls, juno\u2019s, suorin airs and aspire breezes if you\u2019d like to look up the device they use. 
p1370
aVThe Juul uses nicotine salts. It's going to be high in mg because the voltage is miniscule.
p1371
aVYou're right about not getting addicted, but in those low wattage devices nic salts with high nic levels are pretty common. It's the same kind of juice in the juul. 
p1372
aVJuul defective or just lousy product?
p1373
aVi just got mine last month :( im disappointed , my juul lasted longer :/ 
p1374
aVWhen I was quitting cigs (unbelievable I succeeded), a cig a like helped greatly in addition to vaping. I\u2019d use the JUUL with the tobacco flavor (recommended) and/or the mint (former menthol smoker) after meals, when drinking/partying, drinking coffee, etc. All \u201ccigarette triggers\u201d called for my juul while I was getting used to vaping. I attribute my success in quitting to cig a likes and vaping combined, one alone was not sufficient. Has she tried a cig a like? Such as a juul or a logic/blu? The juul tobacco flavor is spot on for Marlboro reds.

aVThinking About Trying Juul
p1376
aVJuuls I take a couple hits on and I\u2019m fine for a while, mods are more fun and need a bunch of hits for me to feel anything but I have both. Juuls are amazing for concealment
p1377
aVJuuls have virtually eliminated any desire for an analog, with a real nice form factor. But god damn that nic level is something else.
p1378
aVJuuls really knock you on your ass, and personally I don't really feel the need to vape unless it's somewhere I can use my box mod (e.g. parties, dorm, friend's places).\u000a\u000aI think the nic is great but I'll say the flavor really isn't that great.\u000a
p1379
aVI love all the new pod system, however the Juul is not as good as the PHIX by MLV. I think until today with all these pod system products on the market, the PHIX is still the best. 
p1380
aVKeep in mind Juuling is a lot more expensive than vaping if you want to chain-vape. I go through about a pod a day which adds up to roughly 35 dollars a week.
p1381
aVAlright here we go! Need recommendations for my first mod and tank. (Coming from a Juul)
p1382
aVDoes it produce more vapor and have more flavor than a Juul?
p1383
aVIDK i´ve never tried a Juul, but you can check [THIS](https://youtu.be/-YtUnCjecqE?t=14m26s) to get a sense.
p1384
aVThey taste better than "normal" e liquid imo. You get the full flavour without the taste of the unflavoured VG/Pg and nicotine. They just give a monumental throat hit and nic rush!\u000a\u000aIf you were interested, have a look at the Juul. Uses 45mg (or 50mg? Not sure as I'm in the EU and they're banned over here) but in a tiny portable stick. Lots of people love them!
p1385
aVThe nicotine itself is more expensive. The juul is salts as well as most other pods. The device doesn't necessarily have to be a pod system, you can run salts in a nautilus mini no problem. 
p1386
aVyes juul's are nic salt, suorin air is a very simple system as well you just turn it on and take a pull to hit the vape.
p1387
aVI feel you. I currently use 6mg too, and for the \u201cfix\u201d I also have a juul to quickly help myself when I feel sleepy at work or when I feel like my body need some nic to function right. Before the juul, I would chain vape a lot with 6mg juice (I also use 2 different setup at a time to switch in case one get hot due to too much vaping) and I also on/off with actually smoke 1 or 2 cig a day when I need a big pump of nic, also any regular juice with higher nic than 6mg make me sick. With the juul, now I\u2019m cig free for 2 months already. Recently with the \u201cice\u201d edition of juice coming out which have added menthol to the flavor, I could start vaping on 0mg juice just fine and not feel like craving nic like with non-menthol 0mg juice (of course I had to puff on the juul once in a while but when I\u2019m at home and can chain vape, I can easily vape 0mg and feel fine). \u000aSo in the end, I found out I\u2019m craving the menthol element more than the nic itself. If I\u2019m stressed out, I still need nic nonetheless, but in general, I can go on with 0mg. \u000aIf you can, I\u2019d say try some juices that have menthol/fruit in their mix with menthol as the main flavor and see if it helps in the long run.

aVWhatever you do, don't get him something pen-styled that will break like a pencil in his pocket. I do my fair share of rough housing in the garage and bending down or kneeling has broken more pen vapes than I'd care to admit. To be honest, your dad might be a great fit for a Juul, which is about the size of a 5pack of wrigley's gum, and costs about 50 bucks. You can get them at most convenience stores and gas stations too, and refills arent hard to find. There are no buttons on it to fool with either.\u000a\u000a\u000aIs it an option to get him on concentrates? There is -some- overlap on parts with concentrate atomizers. Luckily, most of the best atomizers for vaping concentrates happen to be the cheapest crappiest ones that we vaped nicotine with back in the day and they happen to be in surplus and cheap, usually.\u000a\u000a\u000aAs for flower herb, I really can't say it enough. Find a PAX by Plume. They really wrote the book on rock solid vapes that last forever. The new ones dont even have to be plugged in to charge, they just sit on a dock. You can find them used for less than 100 bucks, or sometimes you can get them new for about double that.\u000a\u000a\u000aThere is a very big difference though. You can guarantee that if it is cheap, it's not going to vaporize the herb, it's just going to combust it, and that's such an unpleasant experience, I just wouldn't recommend it. There are so many parts that could melt with that type of heat in there, it'd be like smoking a bowl out of plastic and metal.

aVVaping is personal, so it all still depends on the user. I started with the Kangertech Topbox Mini Kit (Kangertech KBox Mini + Toptank), moved to the Vaporesso Revenger with NRG Tank, then got a Uwell Crown 3, bought a Smok ProColor Kit (with Smok TFV8 Big Baby Beast Tank), and now I've bought myself a Mad Hatter RDTA, Kylin RTA, and Ammit RTA. \u000a\u000aMy SO on the other hand started with the Smok V8 Stick with TFV8 Big Baby Beast Tank then moved on to get a Smok T-Priv. I gave him my matte black Uwell Crown 3 Tank as I got myself a blue one. This is his current setup. He got himself the TFV8 RCA deck. He has a Kylin RTA and Ammit RTA on the way, plus the glass extension for his Big Baby Beast for use with the RCA.\u000a\u000aWe both default to sub ohm vaping because we like the flavour explosion in our mouth plus the sensation of inhaling vapour. What was difficult for my SO with quitting wasn't the fact that he craved the nicotine rush (though he does this from time to time especially when vaping my 0 mg nicotine juices), but the sensorimotor sensation of inhaling and exhaling smoke.\u000a\u000aI am thinking of getting him a MTL set up with high nicotine however for the rare times he's seeking that nicotine rush. Perhaps I'll look into the Juul. He won't be using it everyday. Probably just once a month.\u000a\u000aAgain, it's all personal preference. What works for you works for you. No perception on what's "mainstream" should ever dictate to you how you should vape. If you ever feel differently because makes you feel inferior for loving MTL, then just give them the middle finger and vape on.
p1390
aVWhat juice do you use in it?\u000a\u000aI ordered some 40 and 45mg salt e juice and I am worried that it might be too strong because I hear the Sauron air hits harder than the phix or juul.
p1391
aVI use 30 in my suorin. I use this when I\u2019m out and not hitting it nearly as much. 30 is my sweet spot. I tried a friends 50 and damn that shit hit way harder than a juul. So def under 45 for myself 
p1392
aV45 is fine in it if it's salts. I use it and find it smoother than the juul, if the throat hit is a concern. 
p1393
aVNyc exclusive Juul pods are here!!!!!!!
p1394
aVjuul. Really strong and produces a similar amount of smoke to a cigarrete. Uses nicotine salts in their cartridges.
p1395
aVI haven't really explored much with nic salts but whenever I do mention starter kits and nic salts, people always mention the Juul to me. Maybe look it up and see if that will suit her? 
p1396
aVNah I ended up selling it it was just too much maintenance for me you know? I prefer just a simple juul or suorin where you don't have to replace coils, prime it etc.
p1397
aVIt has to do with the large amount of vape you get at once. You can Vape a juul with 50mg juice and a small amount of cloud and get a satisfying hit or you can vape a sub tank with 6mg and get a big cloud and still get a satisfying hit. I remember when 12 mg was 'low' as well but we were also getting weak ego twist hits 
p1398
aVI\u2019ve been using a Juul for 13 days. So idk. 
p1399
aVI\u2019ve been using a Juul for 14 days. Haven\u2019t had a cig in 9. It\u2019s still not as good as a cigarette:( I was doing really well but yesterday I felt like shit. Maybe the withdrawals are coming in waves? I\u2019m also very bloated and my back hurts. Just a little in the morning 
p1400
aVIdk what I want anymore hahahaha I think I want a CIGARETTE that is maybe why I\u2019m feeling so weird. I\u2019ve been using a Juul for 14 days. Haven\u2019t had a cig in 9. It\u2019s still not as good as a cigarette:( I was doing really well but yesterday I felt like shit. Maybe the withdrawals are coming in waves? I\u2019m also very bloated and my back hurts.

p1402
aVEver since I quit and started vaping my back hurts in the morning. I\u2019m bloated af. Less relaxed, aches and pains, anxiety. The fuk you call that? Maybe it is mental but that\u2019s just the way it is. Maybe the Juul ain\u2019t cutting it. My addiction was strong. I\u2019m also an ex drug addicted. I am an addictive personality. The hell you want from me lol you giving me tough love?
p1403
aVI feel like an RDA isn\u2019t reasonable when you\u2019re busy or out and about. I feel like if I went that route I\u2019d be annoyed and just go back to cigs. BUT. I feel like an RDA is a good at home device. If high nic loses its flavor, a Juul has a lot of nic and I am fine with the flavor. I feel like anything else would taste amazing to me lol 
p1404
aVAn RDA isn't a total pain in the ass when out and about, IMO. Luckily though squonking is a thing, and a damn good one at that. Throw a single coil RDA on top, and one 18650 and the juice in the mod lasts me a full work day. I'd actually like to try a JUUL/nicotine salts, I hear good things about the rate/method of nicotine absorption with salts.
p1405
aVJuul isn't the best out there, even for stealthy MTL. Japanese Tobacco International also has a minority stake in the business. I don't know if that's relevant or not, but I don't feel comfortable supporting tobacco companies. \u000a\u000aIf you're looking for something satisfying but not a subtank try to Saurin Air. You get a bit more vapor and better flavors.
p1406
aVYeah I know what you mean.\u000a\u000aHonestly I'd say your best bet is to stay with the juul or get a phix or something else with salt nic because it is the closest to a cigarette that your gonna get.
p1407
aVNice! 17 year smoker here. Haven\u2019t had a cig in 9 days. Been using a Juul. 
p1408
aV100 percent get a juul or a phix for Ur mum.\u000a\u000aThey use salt nicotine which absorbs faster and has better throat hit like a cigarette and it uses pods so it's extremely simple to use and there won't be any problems usually.
p1409
aVTrying to get off the old cigs and finally took the plunge. My local vape shop came highly recommended and I ended up leaving with this (VooPoo Newbie 80W + Tobeco Mini Super Tank).\u000a\u000aI told myself I just wanted to quit smoking -- that I wouldn't "get into" vaping, but man, the bug has bitten me hard. I guess I should've seen it coming given that I'm already into diy/electronics and used to work as a low voltage tech. Already have plans for my first RDA and a new mod so I can give the girlfriend this one (she liked mine so much she said she'd give quitting a try). I just can't put this thing down.\u000a\u000aI haven't quit yet completely, but in two weeks I'm already down to ~5 analogs a day (from 2 packs a day). Plan on picking up a juul to help for those few hard cravings I keep getting (w/coffee in the morning, right after work, and right after meals are tough for me). Thanks for all the inspiration y'all.
p1410
aVjust got a juul, need some help
p1411
aVYou hit the mod for 5 months without experiencing this? Then you stopped hitting the mod for a month? During that month did you hit the Juul?
p1412
aVJUUL usage day 9-12: It has been 9 days since I\u2019ve had a cigarette. 9, frickin\u2019, days.
p1413
aVAfter breaking 4 Juuls, I switched to the Phix, which I actually liked better, until it broke. Now I'm vaping on an Aspire Plato. The juice in a Juul/Phix is definitely more satisfying when trying to get off tobacco, I personally would say wait until after the cravings end before you try and switch to something that is going to give you a straight to lung hit because it doesn't resemble a cig as much as the mouth the lung high nic hits do 
p1414
aVI have personally never liked a tank/mod mouth to lung setup nearly as much as the Phix or Juul and there is only like one company that sells juice remotely close to the juice you are currently vaping in the pods. Just letting you know before you try to upgrade or whatever and can't get nearly as good of a hit

aVSo I\u2019m fucked is what you\u2019re saying. Because the Juul isn\u2019t cutting it right now. 
p1417
aVThanks! If it's the mi one though, no worries? Because the battery is in the unit, if not I have my juul.
p1418
aVcheck the Juul, Eleaf icare mini or Aspire Breeze and see some reviews about them.
p1419
aVJuul is probably the best way to go to quit smoking. 
p1420
aVOthers will probably suggest the Juul, and they're not wrong. However I'll go against the norm and suggest either a SMOK Stick v8 or Kangertech Subvod. Both very nice pen style vapes that will produce a much better vapor and will probably last longer too.
p1421
aVIf you smoke lites or anything less than a pack a day, do not go with the juul. You will find it very harsh and way too strong. Go with the icare mini and just buy your juice with your preferred nic concentration. Go with any refillable ultra portable device, really. That way you can tailor the experience to your own personal preference. 
p1422
aVCan you refill the pods yourself? The insane pod prices always were a big deal breaker for me. I just recently realized it's possible with a Juul which spiked my interest in those tiny setups again. Haven't pulled the trigger yet but I'd really like something very portable and lowkey for when I'm out and about.
p1423
aVIt can mess up your juul though
p1424
aVThat's a pity, I think the Juul is meant to be similar
p1425
aVGet a juul. More on the pricey side but IMO it\u2019s the best MTL device out there. 
p1426
aVDay 7/8 using JUUL: I have been going through a pod every 1 1/2 days - which is pretty good. So I actually must be getting less nicotine than I did with cigarettes-also good.
p1427
aVThe vapour probably shot to your lungs because the tank and coil was for Direct to Lung hits with sub ohm vaping. Your Juul is MTL and offers, as close as possible, the experience of smoking a cigarette. \u000a\u000aYou just experienced the difference between a MTL set up and a DTL.
p1428
aVJuul pod contains "50" mg of nicotine in each pod per milligram of juice. I am not sure if they are using Nic salt, but I own a couple of Phix by MLV and I am hooked on the nic salt liquids. I recently just purchased the Eleaf iCare 2 which you can fill your own nic salt juices and the store by my house carries many freat flavors from popular brands that I can trust. So far I am loving it. I also have a few friends who uses Juuls on their daily basic but converted to the Eleaf iCare 2 because it's so much cheaper and last way long. The iCare last almost 2 days per charge and a 30ml bottle of Nic salt liquid is about $25 - $30. A bottle of 30 ml can lasts me up to 3 weeks. So I think you're looking to get a MTL device, the iCare is a device I recommend. It'a just about twice the size of a Juul but same length.
p1429
aVjust get a juul. noob.

aVDay 6 using Juul: Yesterday was my first day in 17 years without a cigarette.
p1431
aVAwesome, a lot of people are saying it works, I'm waiting for my starter kit to come in the mail, hopeful but unsure if will really be able to quit smoking. 19 year habit up to 2 packs a day sometimes. Tried vaping a little before but never got into it just heard of the juul the other day and tried a few hits from a co-worker.
p1432
aVchill man, Im realizing now you kids are blowing fat clouds, the juul just doesnt do that
p1433
aV&gt;you kids are blowing fat clouds, the juul just doesnt do that\u000a\u000aCigs don't blow fat clouds either, but it's still obnoxious to do around other people in public areas, let alone in a restaurant.\u000a\u000aAnd I'm definitely not a kid, yet you're the one acting like one.  Like I said before just use some common sense... not everyone is familiar with what vaping is, and the way to educate them is NOT doing it in a fucking restaurant full of people and acting confused as to why you're getting dirty looks.
p1434
aVGet them a Juul.

p1442
aVI have been dipping for 5 years and smoking on and off, picking up a Juul after work today
p1443
aVCan confirm. At my college unless it's a JUUL then vaping is looked at as tacky 
p1444
aVSo from my understanding, your looking to get back into vaping, but don't know where to begin. Thats completely understandable because getting into these kinds of things can be tricky at first. Let me start by explaining about vaping, that might be easier to understand. So you obviously know that vaping is an alternative to the sticks, to help you quit. To understand Wattage, and resistance. These are some basic electricity principles that we should look at. Wattage how fast electricity can be pushed through a wire or circuit, resistance is the wires ability to resist the flow of electricity, and voltage is the amount of electricity flowing through the wire. Typically for vaping, we look at wattage and resistance (resistance measured in ohms) to determine what we run our mods at. There are formulas that help you identify what wattage you should be running at when it comes to vaping, but for the most part, a pre-built coil will allow typically tell you what to run you wattage at for mods. So for example, i have my mod with a uwell crown three tank. The pre-built coils i use are labeled on the side with the resistance of the coil, and the range for wattage i should run at. So lets say i have a .2 ohm coil, i can typically run at 70-90 watts without burning the coil out. Now to address what you stated earlier about you coil for your alien, yes, your coil is bad and needs replacing, they sell coils online and in local shops, when you go in, just ask the local shop "hey i need new coils for my X tank" (X being whatever tank your using) From my understanding, you have a kit for your alien, so you probably have a tfv8 baby beast, or big baby beast.\u000a\u000aNow that you understand better, let me make a recommendation for you to try that will help you quit the sticks all together. The device i'm linking is called a juul E-cig. The way these little guys work is you just puff on it like a normal cigarette, and after a certain amount of time, you replace the pods which contain the ejuice. This is a neat little device thats portable, easy to use, and user friendly.\u000a\u000aLink: https://www.juulvapor.com/shop-juul\u000a\u000aIf you have any other questions please ask
p1445
aVHeavy smoker here and on day 5 of using the Juul and it does work. \U0001f44d
p1446
aVWhen I graduate from the Juul this device from eLeaf looks like a keeper. (iStick Trim)
p1447
aVhonestly; if youre coming off the juul, id reccomend a Mi-One. theyre about half the size of this, and the tank is internal. its made for high mg juices. for example, i have 45mg nicotine salts in mine. 
p1448
aVDay 4 Juul usage: Smoked my one cigarette today and I felt absolutely terrible. That\u2019s a good sign.
p1449
aVSo basically ur juno is a goner. Their support is fucked and you will not be able to get a replacement. Better off getting a juul
p1450
aVDAY 3 Juul usage: At work, feel weird. Want a cigarette - haven\u2019t had one.
p1451
aVIt\u2019s a Juul so the pods are like 5% which comes out to something crAzy like 50mg or something. Someone can confirm this. 
p1452
aVThe juul is a pod system with nic salt juice, I believe each pod has around 45-55mg of nic. It got my dad off cigs after 40+ years of smoking.
p1453
aVThe tingling might be the pods maybe use another pod? And ive been using the Aspire Breeze with CRFT Nicotine salt. Works pretty well together. I used to use the Juul but ive been exploring a lot more devices and this was the best by far although it is a lot bigger than the juul. 
p1454
aVDay 2 using a Juul: Yesterday I had one cigarette. Today I am having just one.
p1455
aVI have a Juul as well as a regular box mod. I don't quite get a taste from the Juul since I'm using the mint pods. I feel as if they don't deliver flavor, but I definitely taste the flavors from my box mod. \u000a\u000aWhat flavor pods are you using? 
p1456
aVthe cough will go away as your throat gets used to it. more good news, if you keep using your Juul or any other e-cig for that matter, you will eventually not want even the one cigarette.  As mentioned by another commentor, pod systems won't give you a whole tonne of flavour, so if you're wanting more of that you may want to look at a mod/sub-tank system.
p1457
aVYeah that's true, I suppose with the 45 or 50mg nic salts in the Juul over-nic can definitely be a legit concern. I started with 12mg in a vape pen, and after my first session thought I had made a giant mistake because my head was *spinning*. After that I got used to it though, and soon wanted more vapor. Within a few weeks I was already down to a 3mg juice in an RDA. I don't think that's necessarily the typical progression (or at least in that timeframe), but I know for me it's become a hobby, and almost an obsession. \u000a\u000aAlso don't beat yourself up too bad if you slip up now and then, but seriously, if you don't buy them it's nearly impossible to smoke them!
p1458
aVWell I'd it makes you feel any better, most of those feelings that you got from a cig but aren't getting froma Juul are not from nicotine itself. It's from the additional chemicals that are truly the most harmful for you, but that the big tobacco companies spent decades developing for one, singular purpose: to increase the level and speed of nicotine absorption. So maybe you can get some euphoria from the fact that you're not inhaling arsenic and cyanide and such? 
p1459
aVI am going to make an assumption, I'm not a doctor, I assume a low wattage device with high nic juice would proven better than a cloud chasing type setup. Maybe try a Juul
p1460
aVDay 1 using a Juul instead of smoking cigarettes: Am I supposed to still want a cigarette? (Because I do.)
p1461
aVAre you coughing while you are vaping or are you just coughing more now? If you're coughing while vaping, could be because the amount of nicotine in the Juul is pretty high and gives a strong throat hit. If you're just coughing more, it could be because when you quit smoking, you start working a lot of crap out of your lungs. 
p1462
aVI both vaped and smoked for around a year.  It's been almost 5 years now since then and I still have to occasional cigarette (5 beers is apparently the breaking point for me but I only drink a few times a year).  \u000a\u000aIt took me getting on to something a little stronger than the Blue cigarette/evod type battery ecigs before they delivered enough nicotine for me so you may need something a bit stronger than a Juul. \u000a\u000aYou are coughing because your lungs are intaking a foreign substance, the same as when you smoked.  As they get used to it you'll cough less.

aVPeople will tell you Juul, but that's a $40 device and each pod runs you $5... You will run through two of those a day as you transition. You can refill their pods with your own juice, but the Juul battery does not last long.\u000a\u000aI recommend the Boulder Rock over the Juul. Exponentially cheaper, function over form, better battery life, no bullshit proprietary charger, but performs similarly.\u000a\u000aThe device, along with a 30ml of juice (about 30 refills worth...) is $20 from Bombies. Get 40mg nic salt to start and a few extra pods. \u000a\u000ahttp://www.bombies.com/starterkit-ns-bombies\u000a\u000aGood luck!

p1473
aVNobody knows.i was a  Pack a day smoker too, but stopped with vaping and then switched to JUUL because I liked it better. I've been using the JUUL for a year with no side effects other than continuing the addiction. It's potent, so keep that in mind if you want to quit.
p1474
aVThe nic salts are actually found in tobacco, that\u2019s why it\u2019s so potent when you vape. It will definitely cover the nic addiction when you are quitting. Don\u2019t know about the acid. Just be wary about the juul, it can end up being as expensive as smoking. I was using one juul pod daily which is the price of a pack a day. Switched to a device similar but wasn\u2019t a pod system. Now it\u2019s cheap as hell. I can link you but the juul is def your best bet for starting off.

aVI'm gonna tell you now man, the majority of vapes aren't a manual cig with a button. But if you want to get into vaping real quick and real easy, get a juul. They use disposable pods, and are probably one of the easiest to use vapes out there.
p1480
aVI personally don't own the pulse but I have used it a good amount. I like pulse more than any other pod system (myjet, juul, phix, etc.) But I personally prefer the mi-one just because I rather fill with my own juice. I don't have any cons other than because of its size the coil is easy to flood. If you do like pod systems however, mi-one has developed their own pods so I recommend you check those out!
p1481

aVIf you want something with a tighter draw like a cigarette there are plenty of ultra portable kits out there like the Juul. All of my friends got Juuls but they're replacement pods are in high demand where I live so we moved over to the Suorin Air and I've been loving it! Easy to fill with just and extremely small

aVwhat's the best small vape that can still take high vg and produce big clouds? Juul and i care are cool but i'm not into vaping for the nic, i just enjoy those thick clouds you can make
p1490
aVI like it so far. Very minimum spit back although it does happen occasionally, normally right after refill but it stops if you let it sit for a few minutes. I use 45mg juice right now because I'm coming down off of the juul. 
p1491
aVI've tried both Mr Salte in 45mg and the Saltnic 25mg and and get a near identical throat hit to the juul with Saltnic brand. I was using one Juul Pod per day and got too expensive.
p1492
aVAll these devices have some sort of issue. With the Suorin I felt that it was the most consistent device next to the Juul. I've been vaping subohm tanks and mods for close to 4 years now and lately I've been leaving my Mod at home when I go out. I'm confident that a full charge and a full tank in the suorin will last me the evening when going out.

aVGet a phix or a juul for those cravings.\u000a\u000aIt uses 50mg nicotine salts so it feels exactly like a cigarette I haven't even used my mod in a few days
p1494
aVAhhhh spirit blacks. That's what I smoked. Would roll my own. Fucking awful for me but tasty. \u000a\u000a\u000aI'd recommend picking up something like a Juul or picking up an Aspire Breeze and running some 24 nic juice. \u000a\u000aWith a vape there are two styles of inhaling MTL and DTL. MTL or mouth to lung refers to using it similarity to a cigarette, and you will want at least 24mg if you are using it that way, especially if you were smoking spirit blacks. DTL refers to a smoking it like a bong, and in that case I'd get 6-9mg if I were you. 
p1495
aVBuy a juul starter pack.
p1496
aVBest vape with similar form to JUUL but an open system.
p1497
aVIt is not shaped like a cig but I have really been liking the eleaf icare.  Has adjustable airflow and can do a  really restricted mouth to lung or a direct to lung hit. Put nicotine salt based high nic tobacco flavored liquid in it and it really helps to get me over the craving then I go back to my tank.  There are a lot out there like it I have heard really good things about the juul.\u000a\u000aBasically look up pod based systems.  They will usually run higher ohm coils and have really small air ways.\u000a\u000aAnother option is mtl tanks as others have said.  There are a few new ones on the market that look good but I cannot comment on any of them.

aVugh i have the phix, its way worse than the juul, but my juul got stolen XD\u000a
p1503
aVHonestly if you're looking for a stealth vape and still want the nicotine I would go for a juul. I love my juul, gives a great buzz and lasts for a while, little vapor production too great for stealth. The only downside is constantly buying pods for the juul \u000a
p1504
aVI second the juul. You can refill the pods with whatever juice you want. I sometimes use mr salt e 45 nic and it works perfectly.
p1505
aVComplete noob here, know nothing about mods, so my local shop recommended this (Nano micro kit by Apollo) since I needed something small, and a juul has too much nicotine for me. \u000a\u000a\u000aAny tips and things I should know? When I say I'm a noob, I mean I don't even know how often I should change the coils and wicks. Can I carry it in my pocket normally? 
p1506
aVYeah. I have a couple friends who can help, I just didn't want to get hooked on juul like everyone I know, it's way too costly. 
p1507
aVIf you are indeed being serious, I suggest getting rid of all of your vape gear and sticking with a Juul or disposable e-cig

aVJuul

aVAvoid Smok. \u000a\u000aSmoat makes solid mods. The istick Pico is a good mod. \u000a\u000aWhat're you looking for? An experience like a cigarette or more vapor?\u000a\u000aSolid single battery mod is the Pico. Pico + Nautilus 2 is great for cigarette similarity, Pico + Super Tank Mini is great for more vapor. \u000a\u000aDual battery the Battlestar or Charon are solid choices. VooPoo Drag also. Then a Clieto Exo, Crown 3, or Super Tank Mini. \u000a\u000aOr if you want something that an AIO (all in one) device, I'd recommend the Ego AIO or Aspire Breeze. \u000a\u000aIf you want something that'll get you a strong nicotine fix and be discrete, the Juul is a great choice. 
p1511
aVRegardless of your needs, I still highly recommended that pulse stick. It's like a juul but refillable and heck, don't we all need a stealthy stick for those ninja vape occasions? Plus, 25 bucks doesn't sound bad at all. Good luck on convincing your wife mate.

aVNic salts is different than nic in diy juice and everyday premium vape juice, it absorbs quicker and is intended for MTL vapers, not your normal DL sub-ohm tanks. It gives the small amount of vapor a more equal nicotine hit comparable to a cigarette. It is not intended for chain vaping, unless you are a chain smoker to begin with. Many people, like myself, aren't necessarily trying to quit the "act of smoking". I just wanted to save money and get rid of the stink. I use the Suorin Air and Icare mini with Mr. Salt-E 45mg nic salt. These are low wattage devices similar to the JUUL. They are Mouth to lung devices that only produce the amount of vapor a cigarette would, roughly. I use these primarily for work where I can't chain vape my everyday mod. They are great for that 5 min cig break during the day because they give me the nicotine effects of a cig, and I can wait an hour or two till the next break. At home, I use a mod with a restricted lung hit or MTL RTA burning around 25watts and I use the everyday nicotine that you all use, but that juice is only 12mg. That nicotine doesn't absorb as well as the nic salts and is very harsh at higher wattages, which is one reason DL vapers who use tanks like the tfv12 or Crown III only use 3mg nic, these people get their nic hit in the giant amount of clouds they suck in. If I tried using Mr Salt-E in a tfv12 and took that much cloud in, I'd probably pass out and get nic poisoning. It is your responsibility as a vape store associate to educate your customers. These devices are ment for MTL vaping for those who don't want to give up the "act of smoking", yet want to quit the stink. They are for people who have smoked 44 years at 2 to 3 packs a day and may want to ween them selves off nicotine but starting with a JUUL or Suorin for better success, keeping the "habit" as normal as possible. I've been cig free for 4 months after 44 years of stinkies. I love the act, I hate the stink. My 45mg nic gives me the same satisfaction as a cig did with the same amount of vapor as a cig. When I want more clouds, I reduce the nic. What I do see and don't like is high school kids buying JUUL to get that 5 min head rush from the high nic content. This will lead to the 44 year habit I've had. There are better things to get high on but obviously you can't tell them that.  So find out what your customers are trying to achieve. A long time smoker trying to quit will have better luck with higher nic content. If they want the cig experience then suggest a mtl tank with regular juice and 12mg nic. If they want to quit and also want DL type clouds, recommend 3 to 6mg nic. If they need the occasional cig break satisfaction then the Suorin Air, Icare / icare Mini or Vaporesso Aurora are great with nic salts.
p1514
aVI've seen kids (my neighbors) as young as in 8th grade using and hitting a juul. Do you find that surprising?\u000a\u000aBecause of this I'm actually interested in it but I feel that I can use it for a while then stop. \u000a\u000aThoughts?
p1515
aVYou said it "What I do see and don't like is HS kids buying JUUL to get that 5 min head rush from the high nic content. "\u000aI'm seventeen  years old and want to try the juul because of the buzz feeling that I constantly hear about this light headness.   And I'm interested in it because it's seems much easier then buying cigarettes or buying we*d in that case. \u000aThoughts \u000a
p1516
aVI hope no vape shop sell you or postman delivers you a JUUL cause you aren't old enough. Second, don't start smoking. I'm 23 and I got addicted in college and I wish I didn't. I know it's easier said than done...but if you must try it, borrow a friend. The moment you invest in one, you will feel like you need to use it constantly. \u000a\u000aStay away from smoking. Nicotine is addictive.

p1524
aVI was just gifted a juul from a fellow reddit vaper and gotta wait til next month to get some nic salts....any suggestions on decent and affordable brands or diy sellers?
p1525
aVI would buy a few juul pod packs first. I like the mint and mango flavors the best! Then pick up some Mr salt e liquid or level up and refill your old pods with the flavors you bought! 
p1526
aVLiterally had to be 0 nic, 100 mL in a day is nicotine poisoning levels. 100 ml of 3 nic=10ml of 30 nic=6ml of 50 nic which is the same nic as juul pods(53 nic technically but bear with me) and juul pods are .7 ml and equal to the amount of nicotine in a pack of cigarettes, now 6ml/.7ml per pod = 8.5 pods, which is equal to 8 and a half packs of cigarettes in one day which would surely land you in the hospital, and remember that is with the LOWEST POSSIBLE RETAIL NICOTINE LEVEL in vape juice.

p1534
aVI'd *HIGHLY* recommend a phix or a juul for your father and maybe a vaporesso revenger for yourself.
p1535
aVYe I'm talking about the juul and the phix specifically.\u000a\u000aThey are really similar to a cigarette and they both use 52mg with nicotine salts which means it's slot more like a cigarette throat hit/buzz and also they look really nice and are compact
p1536
aVNic salt is made for those little aio pod type vape. I'm using 45mg Mr. Salt-E Strawberry Funnel cake in an ICare mini and a Suorin Air. It absorbs more/faster than regular nic so you only want 5 to 10 hits to get the equivalent nic of a cig, leaving you more satisfied and not meant for chain vaping. I use it for work where I can't chain vape, I take it outside for about 5 mins every hour and I'm good to go till the next hour or so. I use MTL tanks on my adv but only use 12 mg nic and need to constantly vape that with little break I between. Nic salt is no where near as harsh as say an 18 or 24mg of regular nic which to me is like swallowing razor blades, hence the 12mg regular nic.  NS gives a nice throat hit with little cig-like puffs and is why the JUUL is so popular.
p1537
aVamerica, texas specifically. idk if it's just my town but in the bathroom at school today i saw 2 juuls, 3 suorin airs and about 5 or 6 junos. 
p1538
aVthey're pretty much a cheaper juul. the pods are like 45mg nic so you can get buzzed off them in about 4 or so hits and they're small so they don't put out a lot of vapor. so basically what that means is just about everyone in my grade has one. 
p1539
aVJuul wont let me buy pods SOS?
p1540
aVMaybe a Juul?

aVI like the juul but u have to use their pods u can't use ur own juice

aVThe MyJet is great and you can fill up the pods with your own juice. The juul is fantastic, but the pods are too expensive. I buy the salt based nic juice from level up vapor and it works very well. Hope this helps.
p1543

p1550
aVUse a Juul! 
p1551
aVI would be going with a juul or something like that and some nic salts juice. 
p1552
aVI typically vape 12mg nic with 70/30 VG/PG or 65/35 depending on manufacturer. I also use MTL style vape. If you use a DL type tank like the babybeast so many people start with, the nic level is kept lower (typically 3mg) because of the amount of vapor you intake compared to MTL style.  If you want to reduce the number of hits per day, the better option might be to use nic salts like the juice found in the JUUL. That has a mg level of 45mg but tastes differently and absorbs differently than freebase nic in the typical juice. Four to 6 hits gives you enough nicotine to satisfy for a much longer period and is not recommended for DL devices at higher wattages. Nic salts are meant for JUUL like devices such as the ICare (and Icare mini), My Jet, Von Erl, and other AIO devices with low wattages and MTL or restricted direct lung draws.
p1553
aVis there anything on the market currently that is similar in size to a juul but doesn't require pods (i.e. refillable?
p1554
aVI don't have one so I can't say for certain, but I believe you can refill juul pods
p1555
aVIcare mini is what I got to replace my juul, I use 12mg lava flow with it and it's nice 
p1556
aVDo you think 12mg would be too much with the icare mini. I'm used to the 50mg nicotine salts the juul offers 
p1557
aVNice!!! If you're coming from smoking cigarettes I really recommend using a Juno or Juul they are cheap and reusable and have very high nicotine levels 
p1558
aVI say use whatever keeps them from picking up the pack again. I'm not a fan of the capsule system of the juul personally but to each their own on the path
p1559
aVApparently you can refill juul pods fairly easily.
p1560
aVFrom my understanding the Juul uses nic salts, rather than the usual nic extract in usual juices. I believe you'll want to use ~25mg juice rather than 45mg, something to do with the way it's absorbed...
p1561
aVAgree with u/didumstrax, JUUL uses nic salts, it's not as harsh as the freebase nic in everyday juices and absorbs differently. Check out Bombies juices Afterdark line of juices, they use nic salts up to 30mg and from the descriptions of their flavors, seem amazing. Also check out Mr Salty juices. I have the iCare mini and it's pretty loose for a good MTL hit so I use it for restricted direct lung hits when I don't want to lug my main vape. If you go to regular everyday type juices and want good MTL hits, look at the Aspire Zelos with the Nautilus 2 tank. The Nautilus line of tanks give the best MTL hits imho, but stock up on coils and only use 12 to 18mg nic.
p1562
aVThat's for all the input. The icare seems most like a juul but there are probably better options, like the zelos. The juul is pretty MTL imo. I have an istick pico rn but I don't like it as much as my minikin v2
p1563
aVOooh! Check out the Vaporesso Aurora, looks like a Zippo and it does give a great MTL hit, has pass thru charging and coils last a good while. Great stealth vape. I prefer the MTL hit of that over the mini, but if the JUUL is similar to the icare's then go for it, they just came out with a slightly larger V2 of the iCare too.
p1564
aVTell umoms to start increasing your allowance so you can afford Juul.
p1565
aVJuul or vape mod?
p1566
aVJuul is more for smokers coming off cigs, so yes the hits are stronger, they use nic salt based eliquids in their pods which are usually around 50 mg or. something as apposed to a mod which you can Taylor to your own liking  
p1567
aVAlso juul won't put out extremely big clouds.
p1568
aVThat\u2019s all I wanted to know really, if I\u2019m 18 how am I able to buy juul? 
p1569
aVWell a juul is a vape. It's mouth to lung like a cigarette, whereas a lot of people on this sub move to sub ohming which typically requires direct to lung hits and more power.
p1570
aVAppreciate the response, Im guessing people In this group most likely prefer vaping to juuling. Is that because you can get more vapor equaling a stronger head rush?
p1571
aVAppreciate the response, Im guessing people In this group most likely prefer vaping to juuling. Is that because you can get more vapor equaling a stronger head rush?
p1572
aV"Juuling" IS vaping. I'm sure a ton of people here have a juul also jus to use while driving and stuff. \u000a\u000aYou're more likely to get more a headrush vaping a juul bc it contains more nicotine. But please don't tell me you're one of those kids that picked up a juul jus to get "high" off of the nicotine rush. 
p1573
aVAs someone who started (and quit cigs) with a juul and moved on to sub-ohm vaping, there is definitely a difference. While the Juul hits harder with a nicotine buzz than any other I've tried, sub-ohm vaping definitely becomes cheaper in the long run and has such a huge variety of flavors it's unbelievable. Since I've switched, I don't think I've bought pods in at least 3 months
p1574
aVJuul is what you're looking for, high nic and almost no vapor if you hold it in. That being said, you can't shoplift it, as they're really only found online\u000a
p1575
aVThanks!\u000aIt was actually my friend that posted this lol but I've passed it on. Although his Bo seems to have a mind of its own right now, could be resorting to Juul.
p1576
aVthe very popular pod system seems like it would fit you, maybe a bo or juul
p1577
aVYeah I have a juul i use for stealth vaping but it just isn't the same as a good vape hit.
p1578
aVA lower power MTL atty might work for you. If you play with your nic level, you can get a satisfying hit at like 20w that won't fog out the room, even with 70/30 juice. I like the Digiflavor Siren 22; it can go from a medium/loose MTL to a restricted DTL so it has a lot more flexibility than the Juul. 
p1579

aVBáton vs JUUL
p1581
aVIf you want some serious motivation, think of what happened to your dad thankfully he survived cancer, I'm not sure if he smoked or not but if you don't kick the habit cancer is possibly down the road.  What I would highly recommend is a juul.  It's a mouth to lung device about the size of a USB sick with a strong throat hit and a massive buzz.  I would start by purchasing that, that will easily kill your nicotine cravings and you will probably never touch a cig again, they have 5 flavors: creme burlee, fruit, mint, mango and tobacco.  My person favorite is mango. If you buy the starter pack it comes with 1 of every pod except mango.  You can by more pods in packs of 4 on the juul website for $15, you can also get pods in gas stations for $20-$28.
p1582
aVI know it's hard man, but trust me I really think the juul will work for you, good luck!
p1583
aVHey man it's almost been a week, did you pick up a juul?  If so how's everything working out for you?

aVHe's making a joke that 15 year olds all have Juuls now. It's actually become a huge problem at my old high school with kids constantly vaping in the bathrooms

aVIt's only because juuls have become insanely popular among 15 yr olds, but you're still right lol

aVI just bought the aspire breeze. It's an all in one juul style mod that also has a button, if you prefer button fire over draw fire. \u000a\u000a\u000aI have enjoyed this thing so much. And I've used exclusively mechs for the last 10 months. 
p1589
aVHow do they do on the power and juice consumption? \u000a\u000aI'm actually thinking of going with an even smaller setup (like an icare or a breeze) and even higher nic strength. \u000a\u000aI enjoy vaping but I'm addicted to nicotine... I see most people going down in nicotine but I seem to be going up. I hear the juul is nice but really expensive. \u000a\u000aIt's really strange, smoking cigs for 20+ years I would stick to pretty much one brand. With vaping I feel like I want to try everything. 
p1590
aVMione or limitless pulse. Or even a juul if you dont mind buying their prefilled pods.
p1591
aVWhen you can't find your Juul....
p1592
aVif ur looking for something else compact and not too expensive i'd recommend a juul
p1593
aVIf you like the juul get it. There's so much choice and people here will tell you different things and some of that advice will be really good and some advice will be so fucking bullshit it might even harm you. My advice is go with something you've already tried and you know you  like. 
p1594
aVFor what it's worth I'll recommend a few cheap and good alternatives to the juul. If you want to vape like you're smoking a cigarette check out the Innokin Endura T kit range. They've worked for a lot of people I know. If you want to get into sub-ohm cloud chasing I'd recommend a Innokin Coolfire IV kit or the Eleaf istick Power 80watt kit. These kits are relatively cheap, have good reviews and come with built in batteries so you don't have to mess around with external chargers or the expense of buying extra 18650s, which is a big plus in my view for someone just getting into vaping. 
p1595
aVNo buzz off a juul
p1596
aVJuul help!
p1597
aVI have had issues with my juul doing this. Try a new cartridge to see if it is just a defective cartridge. I had a defective cartridge one time.
p1598
aVi just realized i said ileaf not icare, but yea i run an al85 and i cant really be blowing clouds in the factory but i might just do it its so cheap. I have a juul but those pods are so expensive i just cant do it. about how long do you get out of a coil on that thing?
p1599
aVAh makes sense. I actually went with the 25mg. 45 scares the crap outta me just thinking about it. I understand it for something like the juul. But for anything but the juul it would be too much.
p1600
aVIf you would like to have similar pull as a cigarette and a lot of nicotine I would recommend the [juul](https://www.juulvapor.com). It's a small stick that uses nic salts in pods to give you 50mg of nicotine. It hits very smooth with a throat hit and has very get downsides. It's a nice small kit that I believe would help you a lot.
p1601
aVI tried the juul. I hated it. It felt like nothing it was like sucking on a straw. I need something with a stronger hit. 
p1602
aVLook into nicotine salts ejuice, I've seen 48mg nicotine content and it's the type of juice in products like Vuse and JUUL. Not sure if you can find unflavored nicotine salt however.
p1603
aVLook into maybe a closed loop system such as the juul or the limitless pulse. They use the nicotine salts that were talked about by someone else in this threat. The nicotine salts are a more highly concentrated structure of nicotine. Not just the mg/ml. It is absorbed into the bloodstream much faster and you actually get the same head rush that you do from a cigarette. It's a much smoother throat hit than a 50mg freebase version. You can order unflavored from nude nicotine if they ship to Australia. But definitely something to look into.
p1604
aVI'd get the Ego AIO, Smok Stick V8, or a Juul. First two will hit with a bigger cloud and the Juul will hit like a cigarette. All solid beginner choices
p1605
aVJuul was a huge let down
p1606
aVprobably defective. contact juul and they'll send u a new one. they're the shit. you'll love it when it works properly.

aVGet her a Juul or similar pod system device. Closest thing to hitting a real cig as you'll get I think
p1609
aVThe Innokin Endura T18 or T20 I think would be a good choice, as would any mod that does at least 20W with a Nautilus mini. I got my friend, a smoker of 25 years to quit with the Nautilus mini. The Juul might be another one to check out, as would the Mi-one which Grimm Green swears is the best MTL vape he's ever had and I trust his judgement

p1612
aVJuul.  I quit smoking instantly with the juul and I was a pack and a half - 2 pack a day smoker for 15yrs.
p1613
aVSeconding this. Cigalikes are what initially got me off smokes. There's no beating the ease of use and psychological benefits (digital/oral fixation, etc). Most important thing is to make sure there's always a charged battery (meaning get two or more if needed), and pods on-hand or at least locally available.\u000a\u000aFWIW, here in NYC, there's definitely more Blu and Logic e-cig carts available in nearly every store (in fact it's surprising to find a drug store or decent bodega without them), but Juul pods are in every good smoke shop and of course any vape shop. So pod availability in your area should probably be one of your main concerns. Juul does provide an auto-ship option though.
p1614
aVHaven't tried logic, but I know Blu are harsh as hell, and you always have to have a bottle of water with you or something to drink.  I never had that problem with Juul.  Juul just felt so much more natural.

aVsmallest they come is cartridge based devices like the JUUL and the Phix by MLV.\u000a\u000athat being said, there are plenty of small all-in-one vapes that are great for concealment.\u000a\u000athe Eleaf Icare, Smok Vape pen 22, wismec MY JET\u000a\u000athis totally depends on preference.\u000a\u000aJUUL and PHIX both use high concentrations of Nicotine Salts, which have twice as much of a nicotine hit, just alot smoother than free base.\u000a\u000aDo a little research and find which one is best for you.

I have the Icare go. No where near enough throat hit for me.  And inconsistent build quality.  The juul gets raves but it's very expensive for what you get.  
p1617
aVWhat about the juul? 
p1618
aVI've tried to like the juul. Honestly. But it really hurts my lungs. I like a nice throat hit but it hits way down in my chest and I cough hard. After a day of vaping the Juul my lungs ache for days. Plus the only flavor I like is their tobacco. I still have one and use it as an emergency backup at work but I pay for it for a few days after. That and it's a bit pricey. 
p1619
aVBack in May I got an iStick QC200W and it came with a baby beast that I couldn't get into because Direct Lung is not smoking. I found the Aspire Nautilus atomizer and it's helped me quit a 3 pack a day, 40+ year habit, the first time I've been without a cigarette for more then a day. It has a great cig like draw and coils are available just about everywhere around me, but @ $3 a piece most places, I was going through them pretty fast with all the sweet coil killing juices. I decided to search for good MTL attys and discovered a few but I wasn't willing to pay $150 for an atomizer so I found clones for $25. The first one was a Digiflavor Siren 25 RTA, this one isn't a clone but was still cheap and I could make my own coils and wick them. It's been great but the MTL draw just isn't there like the Nautilus but this is when I discovered I do like restricted DL hits. Then I found the Kayfun 5 clone and it too, isn't quite right for MTL hits out of the box but I can buy restrictive orifices if I want. It's pretty close but it's mainly restrictive DL. I have the Coppervape Skyline coming in the mail any day now and it comes with a couple orifices to help adjust for draw and I can buy a pack of 8 different ones to help dial it in better. I'm considering the Squape RTA but again it will be a clone because authentic is about $160 and made in Germany.\u000a\u000aI just started experimenting with Temp control using titanium and SS wire to make coils and while it's not a perfected technology, it's been interesting and saves the wicks and prevents dry hits if you get it right, so they say. I have noticed my wick is lasting about a day longer than wattage mode. Making coils is cheap cheap after the initial investment that a little over the cost of 3 packs of replacement coils. These MTL attys can work with some tinkering, which helps me keep busy too. \u000a\u000a\u000aAs for nic content, I've noticed that some vendors don't even carry 12mg, which is what I burn but I've heard you can find vendors online that sell something called Nicotine Salts e-juice that have very high nic content. The JUUL cigalike pods come with this it and people seem to say the JUUL is great for getting people off the cigs.
p1620
aVIf you want to really kick cigs, I would recommend the juul 110% it's 50mg nic but they use nicotine salts so it's not as harsh, it's a pod system mouth to lung vape with a nice throat hit.
p1621
aVWant to bring my juul killer on fam trip, flying but only with a backpack, how can i get it through without everyone finding out
p1622
aVSame buzz as a juul from a vape?
p1623
aVWell, the guy was an idiot. 3mg is the lowest you can go really. Try 9 or 6. That being said, the Juul hits like a train due to nicotine salts. 
p1624
aV3mg is not high at all. Its a pretty normal standard. \u000a\u000aThe difference in the Juul is that it is 50mg of nic, but its a tighter hit. If you were to put 50mg in a Stick V8 you'd probably pass out, barf, get really high, or a mix of it all.\u000a\u000aYou can go to 6mg or higher, but you will get a harsher throat hit, and lose some of the flavor.\u000a\u000aIf you've never smoked cigs I'd advised against using Nic at all. If you want a buzz do something different.
p1625
aVI use the juul sometimes when I go places and I don't want to take my big mod, some of their juices are legit worse than the throat hit off a 50nic juul it's insane
p1626
aVIs a juul a good starter vape?
p1627
aVJuuls are very trendy among teenagers at the moment. I'm 19 and a bunch of my friends use juuls just for the head-high, and I have tried them many times. I have a vape and there is a huge difference between the two. Juuls are very harsh hitting, batteries don't last long, and the carts are expensive. Better off just spending an extra 20 bucks and getting a cheap starter mod like an eleaf pico.
p1628
aVYeah ive used both and i know what a juul feels like, im close to getting either a juul or a smok nano one mod but idk its kind of better for the juul since its so descreet
p1629
aVI suggest looking on YouTube and search for review shootouts. Search \u000aJUUL, my von erl, phix, Bo, cig-a-likes, Penguin, Aurora, iCare, Breeze. Others will also pop up as you watch. Personally, refillable ones I feel are the more economical option.
p1630
aVYeah im probably just gonna get a juul
p1631
aVWell it depends what you are aiming at. Considering that you want to keep it simple, nice and cheap then I would say to go for some AIO's. That way there is no hassle with batteries and such (wicking, wrapping and other stuff). You can also look into getting some easy devices like the juul. I've never used it, but read a lot threads here with positive respones.\u000a\u000aOtherwise you can just get a starter kit with a small mod. the AL85 for example. You can get some MTL tanks and pre-made coils. You'll probably get more flavour and more cloud production.
p1632
aVJuul orange light blinking [HELP] OFFERING REWARD
p1633
aVwow, I just looked that up because I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the Juul that was refillable. Dang the icare is affordable! Do you like it?
p1634
aVYeah this is the first mod i've ever built in. and i bought the S/O the best starter kit my local store recommended. I previously used Pod systems such as the Juul and the Sourin Air but im having alot of fun with low-nic and good flavour juices in this first mod. \u000a\u000aSmall question, in the Serpent SMM are the included coils supposed to be such low ohms like .14?\u000a\u000aand Cheers. 
p1635
aVNicotine most definitely suppresses hunger, but you shouldn't rely on it to lose weight. I got to into the habit with juuling too much and actually ended up losing some weight, mind you I didn't need to as I was already pretty thin. If you want to stop the snacking habit then I would say do 0 mg or 3 mg if you want a little bit of nicotine, but vaping shouldn't be used to stop eating.
p1636
aVThanks for the heads up. I was planning on ditching it anyways and getting a juul or Phix instead. 
p1637
aVStart with 6. If it seems too harsh or too much, go down to 3. If using a small device (1 ohm +, like the Icare, juul etc) then you will need like a 12mg or more juice.
p1638
aVIt's gonna be kind of hard to say no starter kits since it's an all in one device.\u000a\u000a[The Smok Vape Pen 22](http://www.smoktech.com/kit/vape-pen-22) has a similar design, but a produces slightly more Vapor.\u000a\u000aIf you wanted to go even stealthier than that, I would recommend using nicotine salts in a [eleaf icare](http://www.eleafworld.com/icare/) or pod based devices like the [JUUL](https://www.juulvapor.com) and [Phix](http://www.majorleaguevapers.com/phix-starter-kit/).\u000a\u000aLet me know which one you like and I'll tell you about each and every one of them\u000a\u000a
p1639
aVIt's a juul, mouth to lung pod system with a custom wrap.
p1640
aVIf you think about it, people who vape 3nic but go through say 3 tfv12 tanks a day are actually taking in more nicotine than using the juul, the pods are only 0.7ml so you only take in about 40mg of nicotine over 3-5 days.  But people go through 45mg of nicotine a day with something like a tfv12, even at 3 nic.
p1641
aVWhere do you get wraps for Juuls? I can't find any and I don't want to be scratching up the battery. 
p1642
aVIt really does add up. You're more than fine I think. Honestly there probably is no such thing as too much juuling. It's probably all just my personal concern with how much I'm using and how much it's costing me. Trust me, it could be way worse and you are probably at a good place right now. Cutting back wont hurt but staying where you are at is fine too. Enjoy the juul man and remember everything is good in moderation. 
p1643
aVMini mods have been making a huge impact on the market lately. Some of the hottest ones we know are Juul, Phix, and suorin air! What are some other mini mods that we need to look out for !? \U0001f32c

aVThc infused juul/phix pods

aVhandcheck. any love for the juul?
p1646
aVJuul cancellation?
p1647
aVIt's shit I know. The cravings come at weird points. I'd be lying if I told you I don't have cravings on a daily basis. I do. But the vaping helps kerb them and keep them Down too. \u000a\u000aI'd give it a go. And if you just want to try it I'd look at a pod based system first. Something like the JUUL or BO Pod system. 
p1648
aVyou could start with a JUUL device, pretty straight forward and very similar to cigarettes, then work your way up to a box mod. 
p1649
aVI've heard about JUUL that's the flash drive sizes pen correct ?\u000a
p1650
aVMine was the 8th as well! Happy birthday buds. Also look into the Juul device OP if you like the Icare. Both are top notch ecigs. 
p1651
aVI have both, my local shop started selling nicotine salt juices so you can get juul stength juice for the iCare, saves a ton of money on Juul pods
p1652
aVGet a phix or a juul. I've been using my phix for quite some time now and see no reason to smoke anymore. It uses 50nic (5%). Can't say the pods are the cheapest things in the world though.  
p1653
aVThe juul and the bo are some good choices if you want to replicate the draw and hit of a cigarette.
p1654
aVHits way harder than the Juul feels better in hand and these "jelly" pods are the best salt flavor I have ever had. Pods are twice the size of juul pods as well.(I am comparing to the Juul because it is the only other salt nicotine pod system I have owned)
p1655
aVIt's working pretty well for me and I had a pack a day habit, I still smoke a few cigs a day but this is helping. It feels way better in hand than the I are or Juul too and is way cheaper and more available than Juul. These jelly pods are fucking awesome too just as good as a premium eliquid that isn't salt based(obviously the flavor isn't as good as the flavor out of a nice tank or RDA.) Keep in mind that Juul pods are 5 % nic and these are 3.5, 3.5 is still equivelant to I believe 18 mg standard juice. I think it's just low enough that you get way better flavor than the jewel and high enough to keep cravings at Bay though.
p1656
aVYeah it's a nice little system. The fact that people still pay extra to buy Juul cartridges when there are cheaper better alternatives out there is crazy(I am into sneakers though so I understand hype.
p1657
aVyeah when people first started getting them in the states the nic salt pods weren't out here yet either so it got some mediocre reviews saying it wasn't as satisfying as the juul I think the standard non salt nic ones were kind of bad juice too, but now that were getting the salt ones they're starting to sell like crazy, I just ordered some mango ones hopefully Canada gets them soon at least you guys aren't run by a dangerously narcissistic madman though.
p1658
aVWord, juuls are only us as well right? Juuls are pretty nice I think they're overrated though and part of the reason the pods are always sold out is because it's the cool vape to have for teenagers and vape stores really don't card often(around me at least)
p1659
aVYeah no juul pods over here so no one really uses them, the Bo is nice but the pods have really horrible QC. i usually get 1 perfect one out of a pack of 4l3 the others either get cracked mouthpieces or have tight fits which screw with the airflow, but there isn't really anything in this price range that delivers the same thing.
p1660
aVWe do have the pods in Canada now at VAPEVINE.  You can either call the store 519-915-VAPE or they will all be posted online @ vapevine.ca soon!   We are based in Windsor, Ontario but we ship across Canada every day.  We are impressed with this unit.  It has a little more airflow and flavour than the Limitless Pulse and the Juul....and the charging box system is just genius. 
p1661
aVI prefer the Juul. You should try it
p1662
aVYou should try the JUUL or the Joyetech Penguin, they're more satisfying and u can add ur own juice to the Penguin. One of the main reasons being that Big Tobacco is trying to destroy vaping and you're supporting Big Tobacco by using a Vuse, Blu, Mark Ten or Logic because they are all made by Big Tobacco companies.
p1663
aVGet your mom to buy you a setup like Juul. VonEarl or something for out and about imo. I'll get downvoted. But you're 17. Not 12
p1664
aVI've taken a hit of a JUUL device. It's something like 42mg nic and I was fine. I can barely hit 12mg nic without coughing up a storm. So while I'm not sure if the guy at the shops ratio is accurate, it makes sense.
p1665
aVYeah that's pretty accurate. The way I see it is this. If you're using a 6mg juice and vaping 2 tanks a day while the tanks are 4mls then that means you're using 48mg of nicotine per day which is equal to about 2 packs of cigarettes. If you're using 30mg juice in something like a Nautilus mini or another MTL tank or pod system like the Breeze or Juul that uses 1-2ohm+ coils then ur only gonna go thru about 1-2mls a day cuz MTL tanks use much much less juice. So that means you're gonna get about 30-60mg of nicotine. I would recommend using 24mg juice in the Breeze cuz I think that would be closer to the 6mg DTL in terms of nicotine consumption. 
p1666
aVSo maybe a juul or Bo would be good for you? Since you cheek it and then inhale
p1667
aVHello, welcome to /r/vaping. I have a couple questions for you and I'll also address what you've already written.\u000a\u000aDo you already smoke or use nicotine products?\u000a\u000aWhat is your motivation to start vaping?\u000a\u000a&gt;I want one that looks like a standard vape kinda like this http://imgur.com/mKWFXrD or this http://imgur.com/uR3okrm i definitely prefer the first style tho.\u000a\u000aThe first style of vape is called a cigalike. They are a very old style of vape from when the industry first started, it's definitely not what we would call standard. You'll be spending just as much on those as you would the JUUL.\u000a\u000aThe second style of mod you posted is called Ego. They usually have a cartomizer in which the resistance does not go below 1 ohm. Depending where you live, your coils may be hard to find and you'll be ordering them online. This style is newer than the cigalike, but still old tech and definitely not the standard.\u000a\u000a&gt;i definitely dont want the vapes that are box shaped with the mouth piece bc theyre expensive and not my style. appreciate the help! \u000a\u000aWhile the shape of the vape is subjective to taste, the part about cost is just not true. You can get a more modern vape for the same price as some of the older models and you'll have an easier time finding coils.\u000a\u000a\u000a&gt;(this isnt as important, but it looks fun to blow huge clouds so bonus points  for that\u000a\u000aThis is completely contradictory to what the mods in your pictures could do. If you want to blow clouds you need a sub ohm tank. Not all sub ohm mods/tanks look like boxes. Here is somewhat of a compromise to what you're looking for aesthetically, price wise, and cloud wise.\u000a\u000a[Smok Stick](https://www.elementvape.com/smok-stick-v8-kit-pen-style-cloud-beast)\u000a\u000a[Eleaf I Just S](http://www.eleafworld.com/ijust-s/)\u000a\u000aIf blowing fat clouds still isn't really important, but still being able to get a decent cloud, you could try the [ICare mini](https://www.vapordna.com/Eleaf-iCare-Mini-PCC-Kit-All-In-One-System-p/icarem.htm) \u000a\u000aIf you have any other questions, let me know.\u000a\u000a\u000a
p1668
aVYeah thanks, all my friends use the juul and i know u can't control the nicotine on that
p1669
aVIf you're doing this to bond with friends you probably don't want to get the Smok stick, it's huge compared the the JUUL. If go for the ICare mini. It fits in the palm of your hand and you control what juice you vape.
p1670
aVAh i was actually gonna say maybe the Juul! its an okay device, not available here in the uk unfortunately and i hear the pods are very expensive, iof you want a vape like that i'd highly recommend the Eleaf ICare (:
p1671
aVThe juul is freakin amazing bruh
p1672
aVWould airport security question my juul in the carry on x-ray?
p1673
aVJuul through airport security?
p1674
aVAlright thanks. If you know what a Juno or juul is it's very similar to that. 
p1675
aVI don't have a phix but I do have a juul. What I did to fix it was clean it with a q tips and isopropyl alcohol. With the pin issue I'd probably try and press the pin down slightly and see if it moves. If it can try to move it until it is level with the other pin.
p1676
aVYes that's what I did. Still stopped working. This is the worst pod mod system I've used. Get a juul and save yourself time and money 
p1677
aVSave you money and get a juul there about 50$ it'll deffineitley satisfy your cravings
p1678
aVGet something like the Juul.
p1679
aVEnvii fit is really nice and is much cheaper than the juul, and in my opinion 10 times better
p1680
aVJUUL is the best answer here, it hits so close to a cig, it feels like smoking a cig but without the nastiness of a cig.  The second I picked up a Juul is the second I quit smoking almost 2packs a day for 15+ years, haven't had one since.
p1681
aVAlso the cloud on the juul is comparable to that of a cigarette as well so its definitely not as hard on the lungs.
p1682
aVDepending on what you like, Juul, Joyetech Penguin or Vaporesso Tarot Nank kit to get started. The most expensive of those is around $60
p1683
aVGod, please ignore the people recommending fancy mods and sub ohm tanks. If he's quitting smoking and has for a long time you want a device that mimics a cigarette. Look up the Juul- it delivers nicotine extremely similar to a cig and is a great device. 
p1684

aVNo more JUUL! AL85 camo handcheck!

aVNo more Juul back go vaping! AL85 Camo handcheck!
p1687
aVWere you looking for a device that has everything all together, or one that's more modular? The Juul is a great device, buying the pods for it can add up a bit but it's not that expensive. There's some other AIO (all in one) set ups that are good too. \u000a\u000aAs far as more heavy duty set up: Pico, Nautilus 2, and a Battery should put you under $75 if you want a full set up that'll last a long time. \u000a\u000aI'm assuming that it's a MTL (mouth to lung) device he wants, right? One that you hit like a cigarette?\u000a\u000a

aVeFusion Duo - but looking for a smaller mod.\u000a\u000aKayfun Mini V3 clone.  Can't remember off the top of my head the build I'm using at the moment but 26-28g kanthal around 2.0-2.5mm for 1.0-1.2ohms, 17W.  Any build in that range in the KFM seem to be pretty similar.\u000a\u000aThe KFM isn't my ideal atty though.  I'd really like to see a nice compact MTL RTA.  Something Serpent Mini sized, 22mm and only 30-40mm tall.  There are a few out there (Pico, Doggy Style etc) but they all seem to have plastic tanks - as my favourite MTL juice has banana those aren't really suitable.  If anyone has seen anything please let me know.\u000a\u000aDIY juice, usually a Nanner Bear clone, 12mg, 50/50.  I've started trying nic salts, (NudeNicotine's Signature) at 20mg.  I don't know if there's much advantage over freebase on my first mix with it - with regular MtL RTAs a least - maybe the Juul/iCare type devices are different.  Personally, I'm getting a little more throat/upper-lung hit, about the same nicotine 'buzz', but it's giving me some light acid reflux (normal for me if I've had too much nic).  Flavour does seem to 'pop' a little more with the salts over freebase though.
p1690
aVI just got a juul and it is very good at soothing those cravings.

aVJuul is awesome, but kind of pricey. Elevator I care also great but very easy to break if dropped the right way. 
p1695
aVJuul by pax. The pods can get pricey, but sounds like just what you need. 
p1696
aVI did at first. \u000a\u000aThe JUUL is great in those situations. It really squashes even the drunk craving. 
p1697
aVJuul?
p1698
aVAgreed! Juul kicked all cig urges instantly for me.  From the second I first took it off the charger in January 2016 I've been completely cig free!
p1699
aVOP doesn't know what you mean. He hasn't activated it yet. You have to keep ripping it hard, eventually the light will turn black as night and it'll be imbued with the power to Rip Fuggin Tits, the buzz will be so deep it'll let you see through time, and you'll be spewing massive clouds that don't dissipate. Ever. \u000a\u000aAlso ask /r/juul.
p1700
aVIt's not the mod, Tanks are sub ohm. If you're interested in an above ohm tank, take a look at the Nautilus or Nautilus 2. Maybe an Eleaf iCare device or Vaporshark Minnow. Possibly something like a Juul, Von Erl, MyJet.
p1701
aVI carved a nicotine molecule on my juul bcuz I'm mole-cool
p1702
aVthat's pretty cool\u000a\u000aalso, it seems crazy to me how old the juul is and nothing has come along that really compares to it. pods have grown more popular but there's nothing as compact or as fresh and innovative as the juul.
p1703
aVI don't think these are shitty at all. I've tried plenty of devices and still have some but this is the way I vape. I love the flavor of these, the nicotine satisfaction, and the simplicity. I quit smoking with no problem using blus and never really needed much more. That's just me though, it's what I enjoy. I don't see how this is any different from the highly popular juul that's been trending for over a year now. The juul has good flavors and it satisfies with 50mg of nicotine. The beauty of this industry is that it gives you the choice to vape absolutely any fuckin way you want. I've had provaris, high wattage devices, genesis atomizers, sub ohm tanks, drippers, you name it, it's all good stuff and it's still fun to try different things but I just don't require a whole lot to stay off cigarettes 
p1704
aVGood stuff man, go with what works for you. I'm picking up a Juul for work simply so I can get my fix without refilling in the morning, making sure I have a separate stash of 12mg+ juice, etc. :)

aVI'm very suprised nobody has mentioned an Icare. Any of them. They are inexpensive to buy and upkeep. The only downside is the battery but if she only uses it as a cig replacement she should be fine. Personally I use the solo for when I'm at work. The clouds are small enough to where people don't really notice or care. I would use a 6 or 9 MG. Depending on how many she smokes a day. 3 just doesn't give much or any nic for me. Gives better flavor than the juul and has more flavor options because it uses standard juice. 
p1706
aVI'm not familiar with the Juno (or JUUL?) so I can't compare. The MTL hit is pretty loose out of the box because the intake isn't adjustable. I've hacked it by placing a piece of tape over the intake and poking a small hole to get that MTL restriction I'm use to from Stinkies. The unit itself is very sold, the body is aluminum and the tank is a tough plastic and the tanks are cheap, less than $3 each so I bought 3 extra tanks, each with 8.8ml of juice.
p1707
aVHere's a good starter for you. http://www.vaporbeast.com/joyetech-atopack-penguin.html\u000a\u000aCheck out rip trippers on youtube. He's does a good job reviewing new devices.\u000a\u000aAnother good starter vape that's hits more like a cig is the juul. It's a pod system there are several others out like it now. \u000a\u000aIf you find something you like don't be afraid to ask. I'll help the best I can.
p1708
aVMe and my wife got off smoking with cigalikes. We went with Greensmoke, but they have gone downhill since 2013. (Over charging for cartridges, and poor quality control with battery's) Juul seems to be the most recommended now, and they offer stronger nicotine compared to others. 
p1709
aVYou looking to vape to kick cigs or do you want to get involved in the vape community ?\u000aBecause if you want to quit then juul will be good for you as it uses pods. If not use the smok V8 stick it comes with a big baby beast which puts out big clouds and you can upgrade when needed. 
p1710
aVI would suggest getting a quick cigalike (juul, phix, cync, myjet, icare) with 25-50mg salt NIC juices.\u000a\u000aHits the cravings dead on when your really wanting to pick up a cancer stick
p1711
aVTry the juul with the pods they are meant to be good for quitting then make your way up to more advanced set ups as you feel more comfortable and confident. Good luck, remember not to kick your self when you have a cig as as long as you're making progress it's working.
p1712
aVIf you smoke get the Juul. If not then dont use nicotine imo, its pretty stupid and the buzz sucks ass. If you do use nicotine and dont smoke get 4-2mg. For a vape if you want to be conservative and get good flavour get the Spirals tank with a single 18650 battery mod, or just get the G80 kit as it comes with both. If you want clouds or dont care about efficency then get something like the Alien or Predator kits, i.e a dual or more battery mod with a high wattage tank.   Over a short time a tolerance to the amount of nic you use will develope and you will need more and more to get that buzz, or you will just get very neaseous trying to go that far. Nicotine in the freebase form like vaping is mainly believed to be as addictive as caffeine but the act of vaping and juices, ect. will really cause an addiction. I wouldnt do it if you never smoked period and at the least without nicotine if you do.
p1713
aVIf you're looking to quit smoking, I highly recommend the Juul. It's a small  device that uses disposable pods. Really low maintenance and costs around $50 for a starter kit
p1714
aVIf you want something small, convenient, doesn't weigh much, and a "pack" of cigarettes last you a day, the Juul.\u000a\u000aIf you want to seriously commit and make a large move, you can pick up actual mod kits that are nice to move on from smoking. I had the Juul and didn't like it personally. I had to buy the Alien starter kit to really get on with my life... 6 months off though. \u000a\u000aIt's worth stopping by getting a bigger one... Or even a Vaporesso Target Mini would be good for you. Small, convenient, and easy to work with. Good learners device too.
p1715
aVLooks pretty similar to the Juul which I have, have you heard of it?
p1716
aVyou should look up Mr Salt E to refill your pods it will save you tons and has a similar affect of a juul pod
p1717
aVI got fruit+menthol and want to try a new flavor, do you also not get as much of a buzz from mr sale e juice then you do with regular juul pods?
p1718
aVCheck out the juul by pax. If you don't want that much nicotine, you can also check out the myjet. 
p1719
aVAnything that works to help you not smoke is the right setup.\u000aDoesnt matter if its a juul a 900 dollar stab wood mtl or a rx300 with a tfv12. 
p1720
aVvape only malle, my von erl, juul, eleaf icare, Smoking vapor mi-one, all simple easy to sue stuff to get off smoking
p1721
aVI would recommend a kangertech TOGO kit honestly. They are very easy to maintain and allow MTL hits with the higher ohm coils. \u000aA lot of people suggest the JUUL as well. It isn't a bad place to start but I would say skip straight to the TOGO. \u000a\u000aAs for juice you may need a higher amount of nicotine depending on how much they smoke daily and which coil for the TOGO you would use. 
p1722
aVRDTAs can always leak. RDAs will leak if you overdrip and tilt. \u000a\u000aHonestly what I do, is when I take my "home" mod out of the house (instead of using my TOGO Mini or Juul), I bring a prebuilt tank. \u000a\u000aThe ones I use are Uwell D1 w/ 0.8 coils for crazy good flavor with subdued clouds, or the Melo 300 for big clouds (though the flavor does keep up really damn well). I also have a Crown III but not sure where it fits in here - thoroughly enjoying it though.\u000a\u000aIf you are looking for a tank that is really leak-proof, check out the Uwell D1. One of my all time favorites. It simply will not leak on you, and the 0.8 coils make everything delicious. :)
p1723
aVTry looking into a JUUL by PAX. A lot of people use that to transition from smoking to vaping for a number of reasons. 1. It's very simple. You put the pod in, and you draw. That's it. When the pod is empty, you pull it out, and put a new one in. 2. It uses nicotine salts, opposed to freebase nicotine, which simulates a cigarette a lot better than most vapes. It also absorbs better, which will help kill those quick cravings. 3. It's relatively inexpensive. Hope this helps, and I wish the best of luck. 
p1724
aVSo cigarettes have a bunch of added chemicals in them to increase absorption of nicotine. That's a big part of what makes them so bad for you. If you want something that's like a cigarette maybe try the juul, they added some sort of acid to the eliquid they use to make it more like a cigarette.
p1725
aVThey sort of use nicotine salts but they add in benzoic acid to facilitate the conversion of nic salts to freebase because FREEBASE BREAKS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER FASTER. I am so sick of people propogating the myth that nic salts hit harder than freebase. It is scientifically proven to be false. The reason the juul hits hard is that it's FIFTY NINE milligram and they add benzoic acid to ensure uptake. I have nic salts and nic freebase that I use in diy and the freebase at 6 mg hits waaaay harder than the salts. The only benefit to salts is that they are smoother on throat hit. Sorry for the rant but I'm so tired of fighting misinformation on this matter. People hear the myth that "salts hit like a truck" and just swallow it whole without looking at all the SCIENTIFIC STUDIES that PROVE freebase is absorbed more readily than salts. That's why crack cocaine hits harder than cocaine hcl, and why it is so much more addictive.
p1726
aVThis is the internet mate I have no other outlets and I will lecture when I want to. I wasn't so much directing it at you as I was trying to avoid the op reading your comment and thinking that nic salts are the reason that the juul hits like a cigarette. Cause they're not.
p1727
aVGo to YouTube and do searches on the following aio units and see if one of these will satisfy your needs; Penguin AIO, Icare, Icare Mini, Juul, My Von Erl, Vertx Plus. These are all small units typically under $35, some are only $25. They're all rechargeable and most refillable. I've ordered the Icare Mini for my in the car use or temping out for a few hours. It comes with a charger and it's a small enough charger that I can put that in my pocket and use the charger as a spare battery as well if the main unit dies. It was only $25 with the charger. There is also a slightly larger Icare but it doesn't have the charger, just a USB cable so that may be good enough since it's a bigger battery than the mini. Good luck.
p1728
aVWhy would you recommend a mech?\u000a\u000a\u000aHe's probably looking for a simpe regulated set up, maybe a juul, or smok stick, or joyetech ego AIO. or maybe something like a mi-one?
p1729
aVJuul or Phix?
p1730
aVI didn't like any of the Phix flavors. While I do like three of the JUUL flavors.
p1731
aVjuul
p1732
aVhow did you take the juno apart? im trying to get into the main battery compartment. Is it similar to the juul?
p1733
aVI am new to vaping and am not familiar with the Juul. Here is a copy/paste from another reply. Sorry for the late reply.\u000a\u000a &gt; To disassemble the Juno, you are going to need a couple of things: 1) An eyeglass (extremely small) flat head screwdriver, or a pick that comes with an electronics repair tool kit, or a small pick. 2) A willingness to face the abyss of regret and embarrassment that has become your life. 3) A soldering iron and some flux core solder. First take out your Juno pod. Next, look at the bottom of the Juno where the mini usb port is. On the both sides of the battery casing, the short sides of the rectangle case, there are two small holes. These are where the plastic of the battery clip into the metal case. Once you've found these, reminisce about that dumb fucking thing you did that one time that made you that guy to that group of people. Now grab whatever version of a small metal yet sturdy thing you have as a tool and press into the hole at an upward angle, then while applying pressure try to get the plastic to unclip from the case on that side by pushing in and away from where the pods insert. So, into the small hole, like the hole where your belief that you would fall in love used to be, with the tool, push in and then down, like you push down the anger that you were not aborted, towards the mini usb port. (After a couple of times doing this, the plastic clips have disintegrated, but being able to pull the plastic battery and circuit board out makes it easier to clean.) Do the same on the other side. After alternating sides you should be able to get the plastic clips free to pull out of the metal case.\u000aOnce you do this, you have a battery, circuit board, or whatever the green part is, and the pins. You will see that the pins are soldered to the circuit board, the circuit board and battery is glued to the plastic, and the battery is wired to the mini usb port. The plastic casing around the area of the usb port comes off.\u000aI just dropped flux core solder onto the pins because I did not have access to replacement parts if I really fucked something up, you know...like my life, and fixed the problem as it was, the battery being able to make contact with the coil to vaporize the liquid in the pod. A smarter person i.e. anybody, may be able to rig something up a different way.
p1734
aVLet my batterys die, now I'm on my juul and can only blow *sickly* cirrus clouds :(
p1735
aVJust bought first vape (juul) couple questions
p1736
aVIt's both. The Juul won't really be something you can use to get crazy clouds as it's a smaller less powerful device that uses higher nicotine strength to compensate. The reason more powerful devices use lower nicotine is because the amount of vapor that's produced is much much higher. The ejuice affects it but not as quite as much as the device itself. The Juul is a great vape but tbh if you're looking to chuck clouds it really isn't the device you want. 
p1737
aVIf you're looking for something similar but better to the Juul, check out the eleaf icare 
p1738
aVYou can bend out the prongs of the pod just a hair to get a better connection to the battery, gives a little bit better hit.  I started with the juul back in January 2016, have been cigarette free since my first hit of the juul, even though I have much more powerful devices and atomizers, the juul goes EVERYWHERE with me.  Love that little thing.
p1739
aVThis is what worked to get my wife to quite cigs.\u000aGet a juul starter kit for your nicotine cravings. This will take care of the actual physical nic cravings after 2-4 puffs. Depends on how heavy a smoker you are. If youre still craving its in your head.\u000aAlso realize, that you ARE GOING TO COUGH for around 4-6 weeks.\u000aIf you will make up your mind to get through that, then the rest is cake.\u000aYou can pick up a subohm tank with low or no nicotine to cover the hand to mouth aspect.\u000aThe juul with its high nicotine pods is really the key to it.
p1740
aVYou should look into the Juul and the Bo One. Everyone speaks very highly about the Juul, but it was impossible for me to find in Canada. I personally have a Bo One with the PCC, and can verify that it is a fantastic device. \u000a\u000awww.juulvapor.com\u000awww.bovaping.com\u000a\u000a
p1741
aVI do not like the suggestions you have gotten so far. I think the best mod to start with is an Icare solo, with Mr. Salt-eliquid at 45 mg or a juul. I would go with the Icare solo if I were you. I have several and they are quite good, as they allow for small, mouth to lung hits, but have enough airflow that you can inhale directly to lung if you choose. The juul I have never used, but you can't reduce nicotine content of juice with the juul. The Icare solo is also dirt cheap, as are coils for it. Someone else recommended the myjet. I think that is a bad option. The pods are difficult to fill and especially difficult to refill, and you can only get tiny, unsatisfying hits from it (despite the fact that it tastes amazing). Someone else recommended a Battlestar or something. Don't get that for your mother for her first vape, that's an idiotic suggestion. It has way too many features and it's too big and clunky for a beginner who just wants to stop smoking, it's definitely a hobbyist mod. \u000a\u000aPlease trust me and get the Icare solo. You won't regret it. It's like 12 dollars, and if she likes that ok then maybe think about upgrading to a more expensive settup.
p1742
aVMaybe you would enjoy a Juul or an iCare for work. They are supersmall and give a huge nicotine hit without much vapor. Very much like a cigarette.
p1743
aVThe Juul will definitely make you feel like you are smoking.\u000aThe Juul cartridges are ejuice with 50mg/ml nicotine (yes, really that much).\u000a\u000aThey work great as cigarette replacements.\u000a\u000aMaybe you can try one somewhere before buying, they are really expensive.\u000a\u000aIf you want the clouds though, I probably would use an OBS engine tank. They are totally leak proof because of the top airflow and can carry huge coils. You must buot your own coils though. 
p1744
aV[QUESTION] Is the Juul unhealthy?
p1745
aVSo just say i vape at 25 watts using 3mg nic, is this similar to vaping the Juul? I just can't see how getting a buzz from something so fast isn't unhealthy. I don't know if this is a real concern?
p1746
aVNot even close. You're using a very low-nic setup. But it's all about how much you need to be satisfied. If you have to vape that 3mg all day to be satisfied, the juul might be helpful. If you take ten puffs and are set for a bit then a couple puffs will be more than enough. \u000a\u000aYou have to realize nicotine delivery is different for every product and you can't simply look at MG level, you have to look at everything surrounding it. 
p1747
aVso what's the deal with the juul? is it worse than normal vaping?
p1748
aVso what is the difference between normal vaping and using the juul, is that high nicotine really dangerous?
p1749
aV3mg from a normal mod produces a lot of vapour which means you're\u200b inhaling more nicotine each time you take a hit.  \u000a   \u000a50mg from a juul produces a small amount of vapour, this means that the nicotine content has to be higher to reach a similar level.
p1750
aVSo if u took like a super long hit from the juul vs a super long hit from a normal vape, the juul would be more unhealthy? 
p1751
aVVuse Vibe vs Juul
p1752
aVSneaky juul photobombing. Hahaha.\u000a\u000aI assume that's an auto return switch?
p1753
aVJuul - ez pz pods
p1754
aVI would say a phix or a juul but they both take pods\u000aTry the emili vape kit it is what I started with it works great there is an option to choose a button or non button 
p1755
aVWho told you it has any relation whatsoever to the Juul?
p1756
aVHere's what I did in the first 2 weeks I started:\u000aI used to smoke 2 packs of Marlboro lights a day so when I started vaping I was smoking at the same time, BUT, what I was doing is this. I used to light to the cigarette, take a drag, but I wouldn't inhale the smoke. That left a very bad taste in my mouth and with every cigarette I lighted and didn't inhale, I thought twice about the next one when I wanted it because the taste was disgusting. Out of 1 cigarette, I used to inhale maybe 1 or 2 puffs, BUT I would inhale it in the middle of the cigarette so when I get to the end I still have that nasty taste... You'd be surprised out disgusting the taste of cigarettes is when you don't inhale it. That's how I was able to transition into vaping.\u000a\u000aNow, if you have high nicotine cravings, id recommend starting with the Juul only for on reason. That little thing has 50% nicotine in 1 pod (to whoever wants to challenge me on this, FACT CHECK ME). If the Juul is not an option to you, id recommend starting with 18mg nicotine e-juices and slowly lower the dosage.\u000a\u000aHope it helps and if you have any questions feel free to msg me or reply here.
p1757
aVNo. Not really. I kept one mod and two tanks. But since I started using the Juul, I feel like I do not need anything else. I refill my pods, throw it in the pocket and am good for the day. I don't have to worry about leaking. Or producing huge clouds that might piss someone off. I love this damn thing so much I own three. 
p1758
aVThe juul is fantastic on a rainy day! Any of you guys have the juul?
p1759
aVIn my opinion the juul is for teenagers.
p1760
aVJuul or My Von Erl?
p1761
aVHaha. Seriously though. I wanted a Juul but as I'm in Europe there was no point in forcing the issue. So I got myself a 'Bo' one and I'm happy with it. Some have said that it's the closest contender to the Juul. The nic percentage in no way near that of what you are used to with that device, however. But I'm a bit of a chain smoker so 16mg is plenty for me. Plus, refilling pods is pretty simple. As for menthol flavored e-juices, I don't like them so I can't comment on that. 
p1762
aVYeah man the Juul is a solid device. Probably just going to stick with it.
p1763
aVWhy not the MyJet? I like it much better than the Juul and the Von Erl. It's almost identical to the Von Erl in performance but the Von Erl has a slight delay when inhaling to activate which is annoying (to me). The negative to the MyJet is the proprietary charger, but you're used to that with the Juul. 
p1764
aVMost powerful (watts) cig-a-like vape pod style?? JUUL, My Von Erl, Myjet, etc...
p1765
aVUnfortunately too big, needs to be similar style to the ones listed above like the JUUL. I understand that none of them will have a lot of power by I'm still just trying to find the most "powerful" of them 
p1766
aVJuul affecting my athleticism
p1767
aVJUUL... simply the best little vape out there, instant nic satisfaction, stealth vapeable almost anywhere
p1768
aVYou want a stealth mod or a regular mod? I also like my al85 with serpent mini RTA, but that's not a tenth as stealthy as one of my Icare solos. Throw some 50 mg juice in and you've  got stealth and nic hit. I also didn't say that the solo was the best, I just like mine. I like it waaaaay more than my myjet, despite the fact that the myjet has way better flavor. I also like it way more than my og icare, which had terrible spitback issues. I haven't tried the juul, but it is far more expensive and isn't made to take aftermarket juice, and I found the pod style of the myjet to be a pain in my ass, so I wouldn't drop double the money on the juul. The solo cost me literally 12 dollars too, so it's a damn bargain. Plus coils are like 3$ and some change for a 5 pack on fasttech. Don't be so quick to dismiss the solo, it just depends on if you want a stealth mod or a slightly more pocket friendly mod than the 2-4 battery mods with smok tanks that everybody seems to be into these days. 
p1769
aVThe wismec my jet is discreet like the Juul but designed to be refillable (not just hackable). 
p1770
aVCan always go with a pod system like limitless pulse, juul or von erl. Or something like the mi-one.
p1771
aVIs the juul any good?
p1772
aVWhy would the Juul be worse for you? Surely you only vape until your nic level is satisfied. \u000a\u000aIf anything, the other option would be worse because you have to use more juice to get the same nicotine. 
p1773
aVFor someone looking to simply quit smoking, I would suggest devices like the Juul, Limitless Pulse, or even the iCare system or something along those lines. They're primarily draw activated, no buttons to push no adjustments to be made, just stick it on a charger, when it's done stick a flavor pod in or your preferred juice and just enjoy as needed. Plus they're a more wallet friendly alternative to picking up a couple cigarette packs on the regular. One mistake I've noticed a lot of local shops do is suggest a box mod and a crazy tank full of buttons and lights to people who come in for a simple alternative to cigarettes, it can be very intimidating and turn most people off of the entire idea. Sure it's become a hobby for some like myself but others just want to quit smoking for good. \u000a\u000aDefinitely consider looking online for affordable devices though, I'd suggest Element Vape as a starter if you're considering looking at the products I mentioned. I also wish you luck in quitting the cigarettes! You got this! 
p1774
aVWell the fetish thing is weird bro, but what helped me was the JUUL because it felt like smoking a cigarette.  Haven't had a cigarette since Jan 2016, since the first time I took the JUUL off the charger.  I have all kinds of vape gear now, but I really thank that little bitty vape for me actually quitting smoking and staying quit.
p1775
aVHow's the bo? I've been wanting a little mouth to lung and can't decide. I've been leaning towards the Juul. 
p1776
aVCan't really say anything about the Juul as I've never tried it, but the bo is brilliant to grab for when you're out and about or just want something that isn't all clouds and direct lung! \u000a\u000aFlavours available are great and it charges in no time. 
p1777
aVOTHERWISE GET THE JUUL THE LIQUA ONE IS TRASH
p1778
aVWHY ARE YOU SCREAMING? AND WHY THE LIQUA ONE IS TRASH? I CANT BUY JUUL IN MY COUNTRY.
p1779
aVHey now, Juul was the only thing that got me to quit smoking instantly... still carry it with me everywhere, along side my mod.  One juul pod lasts me like a week now though because I only use it for super discrete vaping
p1780
aVJesus christ!\u000a\u000aJust buy a Juul and be done with it 
p1781
aVI like that they're marketed as refillable and are not just hacked to be refilled luke the Juul and shit. 
p1782
aVI got one as soon as I could. Love the futuristic/sci-fi looks and couldn't wait for the release date. When I finally got it I was pretty disappointed. I think part of my problem was my juice, as well as wanting it to equal the Juul with mint pods. After fiddling with the pods, rebuilding,  rewicking, etc. I ordered some more pods and other flavors of salt juices. I've been using it solely for the past couple days though, while waiting for the new pods, and have been enjoying it.
p1783
aVAnyone know the wattage of a juul?
p1784
aVThe pods more or less expensive than juul?
p1785
aVJuul competitors?
p1786
aVThe Bo One is really good and almost exactly like a Juul. The draw is very tight on it, much like a cigarette. It also has an optional 1500 may PCC that is really nice and will charge your ecig for up to 5 days. \u000a\u000abovaping.com\u000a\u000ahttps://youtu.be/Tir7ZhG8FSM

aVBlu is terrible, as are most all gas station cig-a-likes... EXCEPT for the JUUL... it's freaking amazing!!!!
p1789
aVJuul is made by Pax, the herbal vaporizer people.  Try it, you will love it... so discrete, so fulfilling.
p1790
aVJuul? Never used it but people seem to love it. Only downside people always mention is the expensive refills.\u000a\u000aThe Vaporshark Minnow also looks good and would probably be a bit cheaper in the long run by replacing coils and refilling it with a good juice (nic salts are popular in these things - dr salt e)
p1791
aVJuul, perfect for a smoker trying to quit.  Has the same draw as a cigarette, no steep learning curve, feels like smoking a cigarette.  I was a pack and a half a day smoker for over 15yrs, and I quit instantly with the Juul in January 2016.  Haven't had a cigarette since.  I have much expanded my vape collection since, but the Juul is definitely one of the best ways to start.
p1792
aVJuice similar to that of a juul but for a box?
p1793
aVYou'd probably have better success with a pod system like the juul, but that tank is a pretty good one to start with. Look into the aspire nautilus as well.
p1794
aVIt's not nearly as bad for your lungs as smoking. I haven't noticed any negative effects, and I also don't get colds or bronchitis all the time like I did when I smoked a pack a day. If you do want to try vaping, I'd recommend something like the Juul. The higher nic is good for satisfying cravings, plus they're small and easy to use.
p1795
aVEleafs are popular here on reddit but I have no personal experience with them. I have had a Juul, which is similar, in my opinion would works great. It's limited on their cartridges for flavors, but I think it would be good for you, being you'd not need it that often. \u000aMe personally now, I still use it to get my nicotine fix, however I have several mods and tanks and such because now it's sort of like a hobby for me. I've been getting into building coils, which is my favorite pass time when I don't play my Xbox. It might become something you might try, and might get good enough to start selling your own on reddit, like I hope I will be able to. (:

aVJuul. They can be expensive if you vape constantly, but they're a little bigger than a thumb drive, they produce little vapor, and hey contain lots of nicotine that works very fast, because they use nicotine salts rather than freebase nicotine.

aVJuuls are pretty expensive. If i were to use a cheap vape it'd be an icare. Juuls are like an upwards to 50 bucks with cartridges, thats only 10 bucks away from a new rx200, and even after that a cleto is like 20 bucks
p1805
aVIt's a juul
p1806
aVThat's the only real problem with them, IMO.  I have my nice full setup at home and even DIY my own juice which is cheap AF... but I love the portability and ease of use of the Juul.  (and the fact that it's actually an enjoyable experience to use).... so I 'm wasting money buying pods when I really don't need to.\u000a\u000aWhatever though...as long as I'm not smoking.

aVRanges $16-24 per pack of four pods depending on the area. Not hating on juuls but if you want something similar buy an iCare and purchase some mr salts e juice. It's the same formula of nicotine juul uses to achieve the very fast hard hitting buzz. Much cheaper in the long run...

p1823
aVWrote a long comment, hope that at least one person reads it.\u000a\u000a&gt;First of all, vape devices use the same 18650 battery cell as laptops. Are you afraid of your precious MacBook exploding? Most of the incidents that you cherry-picked in this video happened mostly because of poor battery safety - shorting them by just throwing them in your pockets with keys and other conductive stuff, or using an unregulated device without any knowledge. If you use a good Samsung or LG cell, in a regulated (95% of the market) device and keep your spare batteries in a plastic case, you are safe. \u000a\u000a2) using Juul as the benchmark to all vapes is like using Renault Clio as a benchmark to all cars. \u000a\u000a3) FDA is a corrupt institution with a heavy lobby from both pharma and tobacco businesses to keep their very, very threatening competition, vaping, less relevant or even banned. I have much more trust in British government and NHS than I do in FDA.\u000a\u000a 4) "Cigarettes are a really low bar for 'healthy'". Anything that gets people off cigarettes is much better than smoking, and e-cigarettes are tools for quitting first.\u000a\u000a 5) Cool or not cool, that should not be a factor for an adult - leave caring what other people think of you in high school. Each smoker that doesn't switch to vaping because of this stigma is a person who has died of a preventable disease just because publications like you told him that it's 'uncool'. Overall, you didn't even present a single good point with reputable evidence on why vaping is dangerous or harmful, and I hope that nobody takes this video seriously.\ufeff
p1824
aVThis. The juul is an excellent product for beginners, cheap, and seriously curbs cigarette cravings.
p1825
aVOn the flip side JUUL got me quit for good after several mods eventually failed. Still hang on to my box mod for when I feel like vaping my face off because the JUUL is too harsh for that type of use. 
p1826
aVHi OP...  I was a smoker for almost 31-years and totally quit tobacco 2-years ago via vaping.  When I was contemplating  making the switch, I was in exactly the same place you are.  \u000a\u000aFor what it's worth... after reading your post, here is what I would recommend:  \u000a\u000a*  Read.  Do some Google searches and read what you can about vaping to get your base of knowledge increased.  (I thought vaping was a "thing" for kids before I started!)  \u000a*  Research the following devices:  Juul, iCare, and myJet.  All three are small, relatively inexpensive, self-contained devices that will let you experience vaping with little fuss and minimal investment.  \u000a*  Once you decide on which device, order several different flavors of e-juice so you can experiment on which you like best.  Don't shy away from menthol or mint in the beginning.  All our palates are different, and you may find the "ticket" to keep you off cigarettes with a flavor you least expect to like.  \u000a\u000aThere can be a huge learning curve with the vast array of vaping devices on the market.  Don't let it overwhelm you in the beginning.  Just get a simple, easy to use device like the ones listed above and give it a try to see if you like it.  If you do like it, newer and better devices will follow.  \u000a\u000aFor what it's worth, I was hugely skeptical before I made the switch.  Like you, I had tried everything... and I mean everything to quit smoking.  But once I took my first vape hit from the beginner device I purchased 2-years ago... BAM...  I knew I could quit smoking via this technology.  \u000a\u000aI've since upgraded my devices 3-4 times, but the sensation remains... DAMN, this is SO much better than smoking!    \u000a\u000aGOOD LUCK!!!  
p1827
aVJUUL users. It's such a small amount of vapor that the 50ml doesn't burn your throart. It's supposed to mimic a cigarette. It's also not meant for chain vaping.
p1828
aVI'm a lurker former smoker. The Juul did it for me and I passed it along to a friend who also quit because of it. I have since gotten into the icare line and I love it. Wish you the best. It's an amazing feeling not having your hands smell like cigarettes and feel like your stuck. You will feel the difference in as little as a week vaping. 
p1829
aVIt's 50mg, but it's made using a "nicotine salt", which is different from the free-base nicotine contained in most e-liquids.  It's meant for lower-powered MTL devices like the Juul or the iCare, and yes, the concentration is higher as well.\u000a\u000aIt allows for much better flavor without the harshness you usually get from higher nic juices.\u000a\u000aBut comparing the mg or % of nicotine in nic salt e-liquid to traditional e-liquid is a bit like comparing apples and oranges, it isn't a linear match.
p1830
aVAnother vote here for the Juul, excellent place to start.\u000a\u000aMeets your needs as described above, and compared to most smaller "ciga-like" devices it's actually enjoyable to use and comparable to the "real thing".\u000a\u000aIt's a bit on the pricey side as far as Vape stuff goes, but it's still cheaper than real cigs, and once you've used the Juul for a while and comfortable with vaping (and NOT smoking), it will be much easier for you to branch out to other types of e-cigs that are cheaper to maintain on a daily basis.
p1831
aVWas just about to comment on this. I owned a juul myself and I think you will be very happy with how easy it is to use.
p1832
aVPretty much anything I have to say on the subject of where you should start has been said in the 40 other comments on here, but I just want to add another vote to the Juul/MyJet pool. I favor the MyJet personally because you can fill the pods with whatever juice you want (whereas the Juul is pre-filled) but since you said you'd be looking for something pre-filled, the Juul might be a better way for you to go. They're both pretty similar in other regards, very compact, tight draw, and juices like Fill My Pod (which are made for devices like the MyJet) carry a high enough nicotine content that it's still tremendously satisfying.\u000a\u000aOn the subject of quitting: there are a lot of people who were able to make the switch from cigarettes to vaping pretty much immediately. I wasn't one of those people, and most of my friends weren't either (with the exception of myself and one of my friends, everyone eventually quit smoking using the MyJet, so take that as another vote of confidence). In my personal opinion, part of the reason why vaping has been so effective in smoking cessation is because it handles more than just the physical addiction to nicotine: it also helps us overcome the mental addiction too. It takes care of the oral fixation and it's very enjoyable (as long as you're using a setup that satisfies your needs, whatever they may be). Other smoking cessation products on the market, like the patch or Chantix, can't do what vaping does. So that's a big plus.\u000a\u000aBut it's not a cigarette--you don't pull your pack out of your pocket and pull the cigarette out, hold it in your mouth and light it with your trusty Bic, it doesn't have the same smell or the same taste. Everyone is different when they quit smoking, but for me, these are STILL the things I miss the most about cigarettes and I STILL have the urge to smoke sometimes when I'm around it, and I've gone over a year without them. So if you're like me, you might have to find other ways aside from vaping to help you quit smoking. Cardio has actually helped me a lot, because it forces me to notice the fact that I don't have as much trouble breathing as I used to. So just keep that in mind. Be gentle with yourself, but firm. Keep track of the days you've gone without a cigarette, and be proud of it. Only smokers know how hard quitting smoking really is, and from one (ex) smoker to another (hopefully soon to be ex) smoker, best of luck!

aVPhix by Mlv is closed loop system similar to juul but i heard really good things about it so i decided to test it out let me know if any of you guys are familiar with this device if so let me know what you think of it !
p1839
aVThere's going to be a ton of devices that will be releasing soon so you shouldn't worry about it.  What's current on the market are:\u000aJuul\u000aMyjet\u000aVon Erl\u000aPhix\u000aBo\u000aFITT\u000aThese are your options, my preference would be Juul, Myjets &amp; Von Erl.  I find these pretty easy to use, and delivery for all is great!  Von Erl &amp; Myjet is cost friendly so you don't have to spend much.  More money you save on a device so you can spend it on the liquid!  Research them to see which would best fit you. Spend sometime researching on liquid tho, I would definitely look into something with Nicotine Salt because it goes best with these devices.
p1840
aVI personally use the Juul and Myjet.\u000aThe Juul is small, convenient, and their nicotine delivery/satisfaction is great. I like the MyJet because the pods are readily available and I find them easy to fill with my favorite nic salt liquid.\u000aBut I have tried a lot of different devices.\u000aI had an icare but wasn't a huge fan because of spit back. \u000aThe Bo is a nice device but pods are hard to come by.\u000aVon Erl pods are a pain to rebuild and their standard flavors a not good in my opinion.\u000aThe Fitt by Envii is pretty solid. I think it holds the most liquid per pod and the pods were easy to refill, I haven't tried rebuilding one yet though.\u000aGood luck on your search  \u000a \u000a\u000a

aVI've used an iPV3 and a juul, and I gotta say...
p1851
aVI love the juul, it's what I quit smoking with.  I literally never touched another cig after the first hit off of my juul, and I was a pack and a half a day smoker.
p1852
aVThere are also tiny devices such as the Juul and MyJet which you can't beat if you want a cigarette-like experience. So have a look at those as well.
p1853
aVDoes that feel pretty similar to a juul?
p1854
aVMy roommate has a Juul. The airflow is not as tight as the Juul's (haven't messed with my devices air flow control, its always been with all air flow holes open). I tried it before getting the iCare. I like the iCare's versatility. However, the Juul has a better throat hit due to the tighter draw. I haven't tried an awful lot of juices on my iCare, but the Juul's Creme Brulee is just awesome!
p1855
aVJuul!
p1856
aVHey! \u000a\u000aI use the juul myself. I love it because the throat hit it give you feels just like a real cigarette and it does not produce too much vapor. \u000a\u000aUnfortunately 5% is the highest level for Juul.  5% nicotine breaks down to 50mg per fluid ounce. Juul actually has the strongest nicotine level in the market right now unless you feel like mixing your own juul pods(its hard, i tried..lol).  Also most ejuice lines that are sold in bottles cap off at 12mg(1.2%) or 18mg(1.8%) now.
p1857
aVYeah when I first got my Juul, i was running through atleast one pod a day. Not many people tell you this when they sell it to you but 5 drags off of a juul is the nicotine equivalent to one cigarette. If you keep that in mind, that may help you taper down. It helped me. Cause most of the time I just hit the juul for the act of smoking

aVJust wanted to report back for anyone who finds this in the future.\u000a\u000aI bought a JUUL and it's great.  Does exactly what I asked for in the original post.\u000a\u000aI want to be open minded to new flavors,  and while I've gone as far as disassembling and rebuilding coils in a ProTank 3 (most people would call this too much of a PITA to justify), I'm not going to try and recoil a JUUL cart, and it's impossible to buy new ones, so\u000a\u000aI've purchased an eLeaf iCare and 2 bottles of 45mg Mr. Salt-e\u000a\u000aCustomer service for Mr. Salt-E was good, but the price is pretty steep.  (likely because it's one of the only nic salt products on the market)\u000a\u000aI will report back on how the iCare goes!
p1871
aVI mean, there are a few all in one devices that are virtually leak proof. Everything you need comes in the box, but you still need to buy liquid. The ego AiO box comes to mind, it literally could not be easier to use and is actually fairly easy on the juice so you don't refill often.\u000a\u000aOther than that I've seen some devices that come with flavor pods you just put in but they are mostly shit and seem over priced. \u000a\u000aActually there is the juul, I think it uses pods of some kind? I'm not sure on that one. It's also an AIO style device and quite small and easy to use. 
p1872
aVIt'll be more expensive in the long run (cost of replacement pods vs refilling) but you can't get much more "no-nonsense, it just works" than a Juul by Pax.

aVI didn't get my parents to quit smoking but I originally got my girlfriend to quit smoking and start vaping by buying her a juul and now she has a limitless mech mod. She liked the "act" I guess of smoking a cigarette and the juul is the closet thing to an actual cigarette a vape can offer from what I know(don't take my word for that) but you should look it up and decided if it might help your parents. And goodluck to ya mate. 
p1879
aVI have one word my friend. JUUL, it's the best ecig you can buy to quit cigs.
p1880
aVIt's good! It is super tiny, so it's easy to stick in a pocket, and easy to hide in your hand if you're wanting to sneak a puff on campus/in class.  It is kinda noisy though, so that makes it a bit less stealthy.  Vapor production is good (but I'm not a cloud chaser, and only have a couple other mods to compare it to).\u000a\u000aI haven't used it exclusively yet, I have it as a different flavor along side my other mod...so I can't speak to how long the battery life is nor how long a juice fill will last.\u000a\u000aIt's incredibly easy to use, just draw and it vapes.  No buttons to push.  Without going to the Juul or a pen-style to get the cig shape, it is much closer to the experience of smoking a cig.  No buttons, just put it to your lips and draw, small and light, vapor production about the same as a cig.  It has a more restrictive air flow, so the draw is harder than say, my other mods, but is similar to pulling on a cig.
p1881
aVLook up the "juul"\u000a\u000aThe guy in this video is pretty annoying, but he explains everything pretty well:\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NyXFxV6514
p1882
aVThere's more too big clouds than being a fucking vape bro. We can help you get started here but you might want to work on your mindset a bit. I started with a setup similar to what I think you're looking for. I quickly found out that it wasn't enough of a throat hit to keep me off cigs. So I had to upgrade. That means bigger clouds. I'm really careful about where I vape in public for the same reasons you seem to be afraid of but at the end of the day I just laugh at anyone that gives me a hard time. Like sorry I found a healthier way to get my nicotine, would you rather me light up a tar stick? \u000a\u000aThat being said grab a couple juuls or an istick pico kit. Pm me if you have any questions. 
p1883
aVThe iCare is kind of a cool device, but somewhat defeats the purpose of recreational vaping in my eyes. The iCare and several others (Juul, VonErl, etc.) were developed to deliver a highly concentrated nicotine salt solution to vapers who wanted to get a good hit without making big clouds (think movie theater or at work). The flavor won't be as good as other devices.\u000a\u000aI think that you would get more enjoyment out of something like a Kanger Subvod C or Aspire Pockex which will give better flavor and a bigger cloud, but not to the point of being obnoxious. These devices are meant for new vapers and fairly safe unless you do something really retarded with it. They will also provide a better battery life in my experience. 
p1884
aVAny new juul flavors?
p1885
aVI usually wake up in the night to take a leak, and I'll hit my juul a couple times before going back to sleep. When I wake for work at 4:30, I'll go downstairs and drink my tea, vape, check my news and social media, voop.
p1886
aVI started with the Juul, the juul pods give a restrictive hit like a cigarette, and the nic content is through the roof such that a Juul pod = a pack of cigs and lasted about the same amount of time for me, about one a day maybe one and a half a day.  I then got a very basic mod and started at 18mg nic and worked my way down to 3mg over the course of a year.  But I will say this, I stopped smoking instantly with that Juul, from the moment I took it off the charger.  Good luck my friend.
p1887
aVI wish the vape shop owners were a little more business savvy.  If customers like us see absurd markups, we walk out immediately with a bad taste in our mouth.  I doubt you expect to see your vape shop selling Naked for $15 to compete with online, but somewhere between $18 to $24 would be a lot more acceptable.\u000a\u000aI don't even go to local shops because I'm prejudiced their prices are going to be uncompetitive.  I bought some Juul pods at a vape shop without first asking the price. Turns out they were $19.99 per pack plus tax.  At a nearby gas station, I bought the same pods for less than $16, tax included.
p1888
aVTo clarify, this type of juice was created for devices like the iCare, MyJet. Juul, etc where they use coils above 1 ohm. In those devices, the nic content has to much higher in order to have any real effect.

aVWhen I started vaping it took me another year or so to quit cigarettes, and it kind of started by accident (I had a bad cold and was too sick to buy another pack, so by the time I felt better I decided to just keep it rolling). Some people can quit cold turkey as soon as they pick up vaping, but for me and for a lot of people I know it takes a lot of effort.\u000a\u000aIn my experience, when I quit, there's no wiggle room. It's an addiction and I have to treat it as such. I've never been a social smoker, and a backup pack of cigarettes would be gone in less than a day, then I'd be going out to get another...you get the point. I can't let myself have one every now and then. It's like flipping a switch in my head, as soon as I have one, I'm right back in the thick of it. It might be the same for you--when you feel that weakness coming on, you can't gave. Rely more on your vape, but also, pick up other things to keep yourself busy. The first time I quit was years ago and I did it without vaping so I'd just chew a ton of gum because I'd never want to smoke a cigarette if my mouth felt minty fresh. Things like that, you know?\u000a\u000aYour setup is important too. I've heard really good things about the Juul (took a couple pulls off a friend's and I was surprised at how much like a real cigarette it felt, but it's been close to a year since I've had the real deal). I'm also a big fan of the iCare. Both of these things have pulls more similar to a cigarette and can deliver more nicotine if needed. Plus they're small and very easy to transport. I'm not saying you HAVE to get a new setup, it's just something to consider.\u000a\u000aAs for dental health, it's hard to say. I'm sure it's probably not as bad as cigarettes, but that doesn't mean it's harmless. There are a decent amount of sweeteners in some e-juices that I'm sure aren't good for your teeth overall. You can try to offset it by making sure you're flossing regularly and brushing your teeth at least twice a day. But also, keep in mind that you don't have to vape forever either. You can use it to quit smoking and then work on quitting vaping. There are no longterm studies that I'm aware of. Vaping is still a very new industry that's only gained momentum in the last few years, so it's going to be a while before anything like that comes out.

aVJuul
p1894
aVI canceled a big order for my Juul...and I received it anyways.
p1895
aVI started vaping with a sub-ohm setup and quit smoking by way of using juice at 3mg nic. A few months ago I got a Juul and honestly barely touch my sub-ohm these days. Juul for life
p1896
aVHow is the Juul? My friend wants to get one to quit cigs but apparently they only have super strong (15) nic 
p1897
aVOh no, so I've been vaping for a couple years now. Got a few regulated mods and drippers and RTAs. Honestly, I like the discreet factor of the Juul. It truly is "stealth vaping."\u000a\u000aI'd rather not be blowing clouds when I'm out, you know? 
p1898
aVI've been vaping since the summer of 2015 and have a few box mods, drippers, RTAs, all that. I even DIY my own juice.\u000a\u000aHowever, I don't want to be blowing clouds everywhere when I'm out. The Juul is absolutely amazing IMO because I can truly "stealth vape!"\u000a\u000aThe nicotine strength is actually 5%, so that comes out to about 59 mg/mL, not 15 mg/mL. Yes, it sounds absurdly high, and the first few hits off this thing will feel like you just sprinted a 5K. However, you get used to the hit and it feels absolutely satisfying.\u000a\u000aThe nicotine buzz is very pleasant, and a few bros from my fraternity that smoke claim this is the only alternative vape that would satisfy them enough to quit smoking. A handful of us vape at our house, so they've tried all the sub-ohm setups and all that!\u000a\u000aI have to give this my highest recommendation! I mean, I rebuild and even DIY juice to cut costs, yet I still buy these pods!
p1899
aVWhat's your setup? I have other setups besides the Juul hahah!
p1900
aVYes, and there's an even bigger difference between a $50 and $75 one.\u000a\u000aIf you're doing this, commit to it. You spend ~\u20ac100 in two months on cigarettes, that's now your budget. You can keep smoking and spend it in two months, or you can start vaping and spend it all upfront. With the possible benefit that you can lay it all down in two months (or less) and have that \u20ac30-50 all to yourself again. Or keep vaping and just buying Juice, which *should* be less (don't know anything about EU regulations, sorry). Or fail and pick up smoking again, of course, but if you spend money and are serious that's *much* less likely. \u000a\u000aThis will be hard and take work on your part but it's doable. I quit on a shitty cigalike (cigarette style vaporizer, do not recommend) after 23 years of smoking and it's been ~2.5 years off now. You can do it, with will and determination and the right gear.\u000a\u000aOn to that - I don't have many specific recommendations, but I do suggest (if you're looking to *quit*, and not just get into a separate, very enjoyable, hobby) that you look into "MTL" setups, and higher nicotine. Do they have the Juul where you live? Do you know anyone that has one? I wish that that had been around when I quit, consistent high nicotine (salt, vs. the standard solution most B&amp;Ms offer), pocketable, etc. If not, take a look at the Von Erl offerings, or maybe an iCare with high nicotine solution. Those should all be affordable options, if you shop around.
p1901
aVGet the Juul, my friend. See you in a couple of days when you're smoke free.
p1902
aVAlternative is the Eleaf icare, got one as my in-car/out and about. Pretty much like the juul but takes any eliquid instead of cartridges 
p1903
aVGrab a juul for these exact occasions - that way you have a backup thats quite different, and as close to a cigarette as you can get. Basically, more gear is another line of defense. Cant get no satisfaction [from your mod while drinking]? Maybe this will leave you satisfied, its worth a try before another cigarette
p1904
aVThis is not bad at all. Juuls are much higher Nic and "act" more like a smoke. 
p1905
aVIm a newbie and have only tried ones like juul, sourin drop and vagon, and the SMOK badge. Do you use salt nics or eJuice? I\u2019ve only tried the salts, but like the variety of flavors available in eJuice. I\u2019m really trying to quit smoking cigs and have read people saying that the box mods are the best way to do that. I am leary of the complexity of coils and cotton and the lingo left me confused. I have been doing research and this sub reddit on vaping had been helping me!! I\u2019m actually becoming addicted to this page! Thanks 
p1906
aVJuul Pods and bad business practices
p1907
aVIt's happening because Juul stopped selling all flavored pods to distribution companies and retail stores, they'll only sell them cool mint, menthol, and tobacco flavors.  When Juul announced this the distribution companies skyrocketed their flavored pod prices within about an hour or two.  These shops that were paying somewhere around $10 wholesale for a pack of pods are now paying around $30 wholesale with Mango being the most expensive.  Unfortunately this is probably only the beginning of the price increases, I'm sure they'll keep going up as distribution companies run out as well.  With that being said you can still go to Juul's website and order whatever pods you want straight to your door for the normal price, it's just going to be harder to find them in brick and mortar stores as time goes on.
p1908
aVI guess I read your post too quickly earlier before I commented.  If your company is charging these other stores the regular old prices and didn't upcharge them after Juul sent their last shipment then yeah I'd say they're using shitty practices jacking the price up in the store.  Where I'm at all the bigger or semi-local distros jacked their prices up so we pulled them off our shelves and replaced them while other local stores think they'll still sell at $35-$40 a pack

aVUsing Vape Juice to refill a Juul pod
p1911
aVI went from 45mg (refilling a Juul) to 6mg sub-ohm and didn\u2019t really notice a difference 
p1912
aVbuy her a juul. easiest and closest to cigs
p1913
aVJuuls actually already at 59mg/ml, so it definatly higher than a 50mg limit
p1914
aVJuul Compatible, refillable, more durable than Juul pods! I'm using bubblegum :D
p1915
aVQuestion about the novo. I\u2019m looking for a Juul replacement but want a pod system that clouds the same as the Juul. In other words doesn\u2019t produce clouds like a full mod does. Does the novo compare?? 
p1916
aVI just got the novo to get off the juul. I was using the juul for around 2 years and the novo has been a very good replacement. Only use my juul when I go out drinking now and the novo daily
p1917
aVI was a juul pod and a half a day guy. Novo pods last me 3 days with 3-4 refills
p1918
aVJuul can give you a pretty good nicotine high,regular juice in a mod is pretty subtle if your not waay up there in nic.imo
p1919
aVMouth to lung, like a cig or juul. DL means direct lung, like an RDA.
p1920
aVI was vaping a juul pod in a day and that's supposed to be a full pack worth of nic. Half a cigarette knocks me on my ass.
p1921
aVI never smoked but I picked up vaping because the idea of inhaling vapor that tastes like candy really intrigued me lmao. I started with no nicotine but after doing hours of research and thinking I decided to buy a bottle of 3mg nicotine juice to try it out and it gave me a really nice headbuzz that I really enjoyed. Eventually your tolerance goes up, so the only way around that is to buy higher nicotine level juices. I would not say I was addicted to the nicotine, I just enjoyed getting a headbuzz first thing in the morning. I tried every level of nicotine until I decided to buy a juul. The nicotine levels in a juul are around 50mg and before that I was on 24 mg and the headbuzz it gave me was way more intense. Eventually my tolerance rose to where 50mg did nothing for me and I decided to quit using high nicotine juice and exclusively vape 0-3mg nicotine juices. Personally I did not find it difficult whatsoever to quit vaping nicotine, it\u2019s been about a year and I\u2019ve only vaped high nicotine levels occasionally with some friends. I vape for the flavors of the juice and the satisfaction of blowing huge clouds, not for the nicotine. I haven\u2019t experienced any form of addiction after using it for a year and no negative side effects as well but vaping nicotine is relatively new so no one really knows the ultimate long term effects. 
p1922
aVSmoked cigs for 7years and i switched to juuls about 3years later i lost a job and could not afford pods anymore so i went back to cigs for a month(till i found another job then switched to a mod)anyways when i went back to cigs i did notice a drop in pleasure.that doesn't mean it more addicting its subjective if one finds more pleasure in vaping than it will release more dopamine and you would be more "addicted" to vaping,but if one finds cigs more pleasurable then the cigs would be more addictive.its SUBJECTIVE so you would say i am more addicted to vaping,not vaping is more addictive,very lazzy post.
p1923
aVI do! I basically haven't touched any of my other vapes since getting the Alto. It has the smoothest, quietest, and most satisfying out of all the pod systems I've tried (Juul, Phix, Myle, plus various refillables). I use the mixed fruit pods which aren't the greatest tasting (Phix blue raspberry gets that accolade), but it's a fair trade off. Love my Alto. 
p1924
aVThis is so close to being a Juul killer for me.  Its better in every way except for the taste.  If they could improve the flavors, it would be the best gas station vape hands down.   
p1925
aV(Update) Juul Engraving Website Launched
p1926
aV10mg for nic salt is really low. Juul pods have 50mg pretty sure you're good 
p1927
aVIf you go online and look up information on nicotine, you'll see that it takes quite a lot to be toxic.  Juul's are 50 mG though they probably aren't used for direct-lung.  While you are looking into how nicotine affects the body, you'll see the problem will arise more from complications with existing conditions (like high blood pressure) over actual toxicity.  You have the ability to become well informed via the Internet.  :)\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aP.S.  Go by Wikipedia more than WebMD.  The latter is biased towards "preserving" your health.  Same thing as if you were looking into caffeine.
p1928
aVok, i also feel like it\u2019s the best option for me because my juul has been hitting thin and spitting and i just want a reliable vape. i\u2019m looking for more milky clouds 
p1929
aVIs there other juice that has the same nic feeling that strong nic salts do? I was using a mod a 3mg for a while then I tried a juul and realized it's all I needed. Small, compact, 2 hits (mtl) and I'm really feeling the buzz just like a cig. I get the numbers though..
p1930
aVNo. Nic salts are different than regular nicotine juice. However, you can dilute nic salt juices to put in a regular tank/atty, or you can get a pod system that allows you to refill the pod, unlike the Juul.\u000a\u000aMy Smok Rolo Badge for example fits at least twice the amount of juice than a Juul does, and I can keep refilling it until it starts to go bad in about 2-2.5 weeks. Nic salt juice goes a long way too.

aV[HELP] Replacement for throat hit of Smok Fit &amp; Juul?
p1932
aVI picked up a novo recently. I was a steady juul guy and I bought other pod devices in the past (breeze 2, phix) which I hated. The novo has been very solid in my replacement for the juul since it\u2019s so similar. I\u2019d recommend

aVI switched from the Juul to the Boulder Rock. It is a cheap refillable pod system. Only on day two, but pretty satisfied with it.
p1935
aVJuul Nicotine Content Claims Don't Add Up
p1936
aVI've tried posting this to the /r/Juul sub, but it has not showed up yet. Not sure if they need to manually approve it, or if it is being removed by the mods.
p1937
aVI\u2019m gonna save you a lot of trouble and tell you to stay away from smok. \u000a\u000aAs far as temp control goes. You won\u2019t really use that feature much if at all with tanks. It\u2019s primarily for people that build coils in an rda/rta/rdta. And even then a lot of people just stick with wattage mode. Almost all mods now have TC but you don\u2019t need to worry about that feature. \u000a\u000aI totally understand the juul thing and why you wanna switch to something else. But if you don\u2019t mind me asking is there a reason you\u2019re looking at box mods?  A pod system with some high nic salt juice might suit what you are looking for a little better. 
p1938
aVIt\u2019s just something I\u2019ve always been interested in. I\u2019m still going to use my juul and am just hoping that with a big ole nice cloud blower that I\u2019d tend to save a little more money and smoke that. I\u2019ve always liked smoking and I\u2019ve always wanted a mod type vape before. You\u2019re probably right though about staying with a pod type system, but it\u2019s something I wanna try. I\u2019m really hoping it will be enough for me, I\u2019d rather not waste my money but at the same time it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been interested in for awhile. It feels like a hard decision because I\u2019m a very indecisive person but that\u2019s a whole different topic lol\u000a\u000aI\u2019m not doubting what you said about smok at all, I was just told by someone and read things online saying they were great. May I ask what the trouble is with them and could you maybe point me in a different direction? Like I said before this is all new to me and I really appreciate your feedback to enlighten me. \u000a\u000aThank you. 
p1939
aVSmok....  oh boy where to start. I\u2019ll start with the light and go to the hard. \u000a\u000aTanks leak like a sieve, coils are trash and 1/4 in a pack at least will be a dud and the others won\u2019t last more than a week because smok doesn\u2019t believe in quality control. The chips and internals in them are subpar. They are overpriced as all hell. \u000a\u000aNow the serious side of things. They are notorious for having meltdowns. Not all of them do but I\u2019ll tell you almost all the meltdowns I have seen are smok. And the part that makes me hate them the most is that unlike other companies that do something about it smok just says \u201csorry I almost burned down your house here\u2019s a 50% off coupon for another\u201d. They are an irresponsible company.  They release a new product every 2 weeks to the point that they can\u2019t keep up with themselves and their quality control severely suffers. To a dangerous degree.\u000a\u000aNow if you wanna go the box mod route do know that the nicotine levels you\u2019re gonna get are gonna pale in comparison to the juul. You can\u2019t use salt nic in them and it\u2019s gonna be a different kind of vape. There\u2019s nothing negative about that just something to note so you know what to expect. \u000a\u000aI recommend either an Aegis Legend or Nova (both by Geekvape) and a Freemax Mesh pro tank. \u000a\u000aAlso the VooPoo drag 2 and mini are excellent options. Both come as a kit and have pretty decent tanks with them. \u000a\u000aIf you like the flashier bigger screens Vaporesso (have had bad luck personally with them but they are well loved in the industry) has the luxe and polar kits that will be decent and closer to the style of the species. \u000a\u000aAdditionally you\u2019re gonna want to ask yourself if you want internal or external batteries. The pros of external are that you can carry spares (in a case for safety of course) and once the battery diminishes in capacity over time you don\u2019t have to replace the batteries. The pros of internal are that it\u2019s simply less things to worry about. You might need to charge it more throughout the day but you can do so through the mod so it\u2019s easier and cheaper than an external charger.\u000a\u000aIf you want to go the internal battery route I\u2019d get a Voopoo Drag Mini. The kit tank is, like I said, pretty great for a kit tank. And the battery life on it is impressive. It\u2019s the only internal mod I have in my regular rotation.\u000a\u000aFor external I would personally go with an Aegis Legend and Freemax Mesh pro. The legend is drop, dust and waterproof and it isn\u2019t a gimmick. I have two of them and the 100w half size version and they are damn near bulletproof.\u000a\u000aThat being said any of the above mentioned mods will be good bets for you if that isn\u2019t your style. \u000a\u000aBut as attractive as some of the mods may be please stay away from smok. It\u2019s gonna give you a lot more of a headache than you want. \u000a\u000aGood luck and congrats on quitting btw!!!  Feel free to post on here or pm me if you have any other questions!!!  \U0001f44d\U0001f44d
p1940
aVHaha I have my juul with another damn pod that\u2019s started leaking as soon as I popped it in. \U0001f644 I was aware of the whole nic salt difference and I\u2019m just hoping that regular juice will help me lower my nicotine cravings slightly because I\u2019m just such a stress/bordom smoker and don\u2019t really have the money to go through these things as much as I do. I\u2019m looking at the vaporesso luxe right now and must say I realllly like it. It\u2019s a shame the iris design is sold out. 
p1941
aVHold on I\u2019m gonna pm you. I don\u2019t want everyone going all up in arms about what I have to say about juul. \U0001f923
p1942
aVDo the pods last a decent amount of time? I use the Juul and replace the pod every 4 days about and I\u2019d like to switch to a budget friendly refillable pod system for juice variety n to save a little on pods 
p1943
aVAll of these will last longer than a juul, and end up being cheaper. The Mi-Pod probably has the longest lasting coils out of anything here. 
p1944
aVI switched from Juul to Sourin Air and I've been saving a ton. Being able to pick your own juice and nic strength is great and the pods last about 2-4 refills for me and I can usually get just over a week of life on them.
p1945
aVThank u so much! I have a smok prince but I recently switched to juul...switching to juno tho this weekend but they arent refillable. \u000a\u000aI may switch back to my smok if I can get cbd juice. Koi is a good brand? Good quality cbd? Ive had some cbd before that didnt even give me any effects but ive also had really good cbd candy too.
p1946
aVNo problem! I get that! Never personally used a juul cause I\u2019ve been told the spitback on those is crazy bad! Koi is a really good brand for CBD in my opinion! I haven\u2019t tried their actual vape juices but I know their cbd worked really well for me! Plus some brands you may have to go higher on the MG to get the full effect! I usually get vape tongue super easily but never did with the cbd! They released this new flavoring for it called strawberry blast or something like that and it\u2019s like crack! (Or at least what I imagine crack would be like lmao). It\u2019s all just dependent on personal preferences and your own immunities/how often you use stuff like that. Same thing with nicotine levels in vaping; each person is different. I used 12MG in vaping for a bit and then I went down to 6 but if my boyfriend hits a 6 he dies lol
p1947
aVDo you know how many 14 and younger kids have Juuls? At least he\u2019s not smoking cigs like most of my friends did at that age. Hell if vapes were around when I was that age I\u2019d have been doing that and maybe would have been less stressed in school. 
p1948
aVThe Juul Is Dead To Me.
p1949
aVHey bud. Try the Kilo 1K POF system. I have the JUUL and this device and the KILO is hands down better. There is not an issue with having to reseat the pod, like in the JUUL, to get a good drag. The battery life literally lasts me all day. Sometimes more than a day. Check it out on YouTube. \u000a\u000aHope this helps. 
p1950
aVI have a lost vape Orion on order, but didn't want to battle the Juul pods any longer so I stopped into a shop in the bigger town while taking my daughter in for an orthodontist appt.\u000a\u000aI picked up the boulder rock and a pack of pods. Pretty impressed with it for the price.
p1951
aVJUUL OR DIE!!! xD xD xD\u000a\u000a[https://youtu.be/yTj9TY\u005c_DRCg?t=343](https://youtu.be/yTj9TY_DRCg?t=343)
p1952
aVThe i couldn't wait for my Orion to arrive so got something to get me by because i am sick of Juuls.
p1953
aVThis isn't a bad little device, better than the Juul. The pods hold a good amount of liquid and decent flavor.
p1954
aVBoulder Rock http://www.bouldercigs.com/index.php/Ecigs/rock\u000a\u000aI stopped in the vape shop and told them I am sick of using Juuls and had a Lost Vape Orion on the way but wanted something to get me through the week, and to have as a backup. They recommend this. I think it is actually cheaper than a Juul, but so much more satisfying hits.
p1955
aVCan i fill my Juul?
p1956
aVIf you did little juul fairies would come and muck you up 
p1957
aVJuul does not make pods without nicotine, but there are other pod systems made to be refilled. If you want to refill the pods you currently have, there may still be videos on YouTube that can instruct you on how to do it.
p1958
aV\U0001f602\U0001f602 I bet nobody would buy a juul again
p1959
aVJuul
p1960
aVThis is the type of shit that makes lawmakers want to ban vapes, people who treat nicotine like its crack and keep fucking with higher and higher nicotine to get a \u201chead rush\u201d like some 16 year old Juul challenge kid 
p1961
aVI still use the juul with the pods refilled with the same blue lemonade as the sub ohm tank when I\u2019m out and about or at work.  I only use the mod at home or while driving really.  I\u2019m scared to drop it :0. \u000a\u000aI like it so much:)
p1962
aVIdk: I just quit smoking cigs less then a month ago and I already bought the juul and the vaporesso revenger plus thatextra tank.   So I\u2019ve already spent a lot of money.    And while the juul isn\u2019t the greatest, I can buy pods anywhere and refill them up to five times each, which makes it pretty cheap.  And I can get pods online for even cheaper.  So overall I\u2019m pretty happy with the juul.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m open to suggestions though: what do you recommend?  I\u2019d want something with more vapor production that can use salts but that\u2019s similar in size.
p1963
aVCan attest to the lost vape orion, had the smok fit and wife had the juul, we both switched to the orion its light years ahead of other pods
p1964
aVPick up a Novo this morning instead of juul pods, very happy I did
p1965
aVJuul Alternative
p1966
aVKwit Stick is my favorite and I have tried many. Fair warning, the tobacco flavor is trash and always prime the pod after refill, if you don't then it burns the wick and ruins the pod, I'm currently getting 6+ refills per pod. Other than that the hits are strong and consistent, no leaks, FAST charging and its cheap to use. They give you 10% off your first order and frequently send you emails for 10% coupon codes if you buy from their site rather than a wholesaler. They screwed up my order once but sent the missing item same day with no questions asked. Highly recommended over Juul, Ziip, Phix, Fit, Inifinix, Drop, and myBlu.
p1967
aVGot it today ! Yay !\u000aSo, a little backstory. I\u2019m sick with the cold, flu, or sinusitis, or something of the sort and it\u2019s been kicking my butt this past week, specifically this past weekend. Spent the weekend being semi productive on Saturday which led to my downfall Sunday and resulted in me being a blanket burrito all of Sunday. Every time I touched the Juul would result in me coughing until my lungs hurt. \u000aWoke up today and felt great. Inhaled the Juul and coughed like crazy. \u000aGot the kilo 1-k, charged it (love they is micro usb) and stuck a pod in there (they looked huge compared to Juul Pods). I got the lemon berry ice and decided to go for it. Taste was light and sweet. Didn\u2019t hack up half my lung! \u000a\u000aI\u2019ll write a better comparative once my lungs function normally again. \U0001f601

aVAny small vapes similar in size to a Juul?
p1969
aVNot a whole lot of vapes that small. Like at all. A refillable pod system might be your best bet the renova zero is a super highly regarded pod system that would be close to a juul like vape and size.
p1970
aVOh ywah sorry! I mean a refillable tank not a pod system if that helps! Doesn't have to be as small as a Juul but something smaller than the normal bulky system 
p1971
aVThat\u2019s not a bad grab at all given the JUUL is around the same price , and I\u2019m sure this blows a JUUL outta the water.\u000a\u000aI haven\u2019t found a local shop where I\u2019m at that carries them tho
p1972
aVWhere I\u2019m located the juul is significantly cheaper than this, but regardless the Orion is indeed a superior device, I have one, juul is too limiting with flavors and nic strength
p1973
aVOh man the Juuls by me sell for around $50 or so but any advice on juice flavors or nix strength for the Orion? I currently vape one hit wonders juices with 3 or 6 nic in box mod. For my Juul I just buy those expensive ass pods
p1974
aVJesus! my gas station sells Juuls for 12.99
p1975
aVDamn, nice grab. I was gonna buy myself a mod too during Black Friday but my go to store I went to wasn\u2019t having any sale so I\u2019m just stuck with my friends JUUL that I borrowed lol
p1976
aVI'm in Canada and vape B+Ms are popping up everywhere, they're booming. 64.99 is what JUUL charges on their website too btw. Only way to get it cheaper is to order from China.
p1977
aVBut thats the things i think when they say "ecig" i think tuere referring to vuse,juul,and blu.
p1978
aVI've been saying this since forever and nobody believes Me.\u000a\u000aThis is the most underrated device ever and cheap as balls.\u000a\u000aPeople are drooling over orions, juuls suorin and other crap while this cheap pod just keeps chugging and it's cheap too.
p1979
aVWhy are there toilets in the Juul room?
p1980
aVLoving it. I was vaping on a Juul before this so this is one hell of an upgrade 
p1981
aVI just ordered one last night. Will have to try that juice.\u000a\u000aI was using a Smok alien 220 for a long time got sick if it and switched to using juul. The pods were getting to be expensive but I like the simplicity.\u000a\u000aDecided on the Orion because of the looks and reviews here.
