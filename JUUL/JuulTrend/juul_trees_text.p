VI go home on weekends from college so i use those days as a t break, honestly the addiction us MUCH less than nicotibe. I dont smoke anymore but i use a juul, and the withdrawls are so much more
p1
aVis that for a juul?
p2
aVOnes a pax era, ones a juul.
p3
aVlol I had to do this with my juul for like 2 weeks while waiting for a new charger to come in
p4
aVlol i use a juul so that helps but i don't like the idea of getting hooked on another substance so i don't use it too much
p5
aVYeah it's a pax era and you can only vape the pre-made cartridges. It's the same thing as the Juul except you get the cool features like Bluetooth connection to your phone and change colors :) In Colorado the pods are made by The Lab and there are 5 available strain specific live resin pods (I tried all of them and the flavor you get from the live resin is amazing). 
p6
aVI always juul while smoking, but then again I always juul.
p7
aVYeah my town has a parents against underage drinking thing so idk why they're going after weed but they sent a thing in the mail that warned parents about electronic cigarettes and vapes and how kids put wax in it and the THC is high and can cause permanent brain damage like it's true and all but worry about other shit like kids being addicted to JUUL and thinking it's fine cause it's vape and not smoke. Like it's a pack a pod and they're worried about weed. Maybe parents against underage drinking should worry about drinking and not weed. I'm ranting sorry
p8
aVPax 3. Pax Era. The links they shared. Juul or iCare mini for nicotine. 
p9
aVbro there's this nicotine vape called a juul and it's the best god damn vape ever. hits like a cig, super light and discrete, and comes with little pods with 50mg nic! honestly made me never want to smoke cigs again 
p10
aVHAHAHAHA man juuls pods are practically currency at my school
p11
aVAyy nothing better than the juul while high 
p12
aVJust got caught by parEnts(drgtest)Little do they know that them stopping my weed habit will only "force" me to become dependent on nicotine (spending 80 dollars on a juul tomorrow, which is like a vape with an extremely high level of nicotine) to fill the craving of something to take the edge off.
p13
aVJuul is only 39.99... \u000athat's in store 
p14
aVJuuls go hard, but you're gonna pay way too much money and then transition over to cigarettes for a quicker, cheaper buzz. Stay away from the Juul, no matter how hard that shit rips ;)
p15
aVGet a Juul!!!!!
p16
aVJUUL vale pod?
p17
aVBeing a Juul user and seeing the mistakes PAX has made lately consumer side has discouraged me from wanting to support them at the moment... BUT the PAX Era is something I'm going to be keeping an eye on.\u000a\u000aNonetheless enjoy your new toy!! Congrats! Not meaning to be a naysayer haha, just my experience :)
p18
aVI have no affiliation with them, so I'm not trying to advertise (rule 9 lol), but I've heard good things about the Juul vaporizer for beginners looking to switch to vaping from tobacco.\u000a\u000aGood luck man!
p19
aVI trust my local brick and Mortor because they sell all pax products, including replacement parts,etc. I also use a juul and have had nothing but positive experiences  with the pax team. I'm leaning towards the 3. HAve you tried anything else?
p20
aVYeah its annoying i bought a juul recently they hit hard and never leak but the pods are expensive.
p21
aVYou can smoke weed with a juul?? Howwwww???
p22
aVThc pods in the works give it a few years though. Once weed becomes legal im sure they will be out there for now i have a guy who can refill old juul pods with wax and that kinda works alright.
p23
aVThis picture has me nervous that cat is going to just swat your bud all over the place LOL. Is that a normal juul or is it modified for wax etc?\u000a
p24
aVI spotted the juul and instantly got moist 
p25
aVWhat\u2019s a juul?
p26
aVOh ok I\u2019ve never seen those but I got a stiiizy vape it looks like a juul and really hits
p27
aVJuul Wax Cartridges
p28
aVI've tried, only thing at holiday is juul pods 
p29
aVSounds like you're best taking a look at nic salts. I know a lot of heavy smokers who are happy with the buzz and throat hit of 59mg, which is what you're gonna find in most pod systems like Juul 
p30
aVMy 14yo started using a Juul, and once her pod hookup got busted, she switched to cigarettes. I really don\u2019t want to give Ploom any money on principle. But I have a Pax 3 and buy Era Pods so I suppose I\u2019m already feeding the same beast...\u000a\u000aI\u2019m not really looking to up my own dose much, if at all. Like I said I\u2019m down to about 2 cigs a day(unless things get really stressful.) But I would like to up it enough to kick the 2 cigs. I feel like I\u2019m almost there.
p31
aVUpvoted because I used a juul because I have to stay clean for a drug test:/
p32
aVDepends on how you pull on the vapes, the potency, and how many pulls you do. I have THC juice in my juul and 3\u005c-4 pulls on that gets me at a solid \u005c[8\u005c]. \u000a\u000aIf you only do small bowls and one\u005c-hitters, 1 good pull on a vape will get you up.
p33
aVI took dab pens and dabs with me for spring break to Arizona. Checked bag in plastic bag with toothbrush and other juul vape shit 
p34
aVThis is how I hit my juul super hard haha
p35
aVI love nicotine sober or high. I\u2019ve kicked cigarettes with the help of my juul, but I still smoke socially and yeah the little rush is great. Sometimes when my friend and I are running low on weed we throw a little bit of rolling tobacco in our bowls to stretch them out
p36
aVI MADE A JUUL!!!
p37
aVI couldn't post this in r/juul or r/drugs but I figured some of you might appreciate this. 
p38
aVThat\u2019s a juul pod boss
p39
aVOil juul?
p40
aVI\u2019d say lungs wise honestly doesn\u2019t feel much different but the high is way cleaner personally, none of the real groggy/lazy feelings even when it\u2019s a heavy indica, you just have a clear head but still high as tits if that makes sense\u000aBut no vaping of any form isn\u2019t a safe alternative to smoking. Some studies have shown that it\u2019s actually worse (but the types of capes are unclear, I\u2019m assuming it refers to standard vapes not carts or things like the juul)
p41
aVCan I pour dab juice into a juul?
p42
aVIf it leaks ur juul is fucked, and they are prone to leaking
p43
aVThe problem is that it will be more susceptible to leaking because u opened up the pod . And also the oil will be impossible to get out of the juul
p44
aVI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good plan, even if you can fill it without the oil leaking. If a cop finds your carts they will not just take your word for it that they\u2019re nicotine because you say \u201cno but look it\u2019s a juul\u201d as evidence that it\u2019s not THC. They\u2019ll confiscate and test it. The police actually have to verify that drugs are drugs, you can\u2019t be charged based on assumptions. That being said, using a juul won\u2019t make it less suspicious in the eyes of a law enforcement officer who is already at the point of searching you. 
p45
aVIs that a juul? A vape 
p46
aVme but smoking a juul lmao 
p47
aVThe Juul pods are kind of made to burn out so that people have to shell out $20 for 4 more instead of refilling them with Mr.Salt-e. Those coils build up carbon quickly and it seeps back into whatever juice you refilled with.\u000a\u000aThe reason you don't feel anything is because the Juul pods are designed to do smaller hits of high nicotine juice.  My guess is that your juice isn't strong enough for it, but there could be a lot of reasons. The Pax Era is better for vaping THC juice.\u000a\u000aHaving said all that, I recently found out that Pax is backed by big tobacco. The Juul pods are really high in nicotine so people get hooked. 
p48
aVFrom my experience, You can refill a juul pod 2-3 times after it becomes shitty *and* dangerous: ive broken 2 juuls because refilled x4-x5 pods leaked in the matter of minutes.\u000aBut the dab juice-oil does look very gooey, like glue.\u000aSo I dont know if that could affect it but it probably does.
p49
aVI have vaped flavorless e-juice with no nicotine in a juul. Btw it is horrible. The taste is complete unflavored puke in a juul and it feels like its more of water vapor. You can blow big clouds tho its unpleasent.\u000aBut in a Baby Beast Tank (sub-ohm atomizer) its completely fine.\u000a\u000aThis oil doesnt taste like that.
p50
aVTry a juul
p51
aVQuit a pack and a half a day habit but now i just vape like 120ml of 3mg every 2 weeks i havent tried the new stuff like a juul but my box and clieto 120 keep me off cigs, though i dont know if its any better for me lol
p52
aVGet a juul 
p53
aVDefinitely not about the movement. At all. But get a mini vape pen like a juul and just chief that when you get the devils lettuce urge 
p54
aVHad a dream some dude robbed me at knife in the middle of a party for my juul, then i got laid
p55
aVblue dream, then we all took a walk in the woods and juuled lol
p56
aVTook the wax out of the dab pen and put it in a Juul pod.
p57
aVI did this and it worked well for a while, but then it started leaking... it was not a fun experience. Just make sure that you don't put the pod under too much stress or you will end up with a very sticky juul! Not fun.
p58
aVhow u do dis I really wanna try it! I heard about a company making aftermarket juul pods with thc in them in medical states!
p59
aVStiiizy &gt; juul 
p60
aVBoulder &gt; Juul &gt; Phix &gt; Stiiizy
p61
aVIn my experience what works really well in juul pods is the distillate mixed with some propolene glycol and flavoring. If you got this from a cartridge that's likely what it is already minus the flavor
p62
aVIn New York the problem seems to be more empty juul pods rather than vape carts. But there\u2019s definitely a huge problem with cigarillo wrappers EVERYWHERE
p63
aVI live in Milwaukee and my local head shop has a deal if you bring in empty juul pods they will give you a discount on your next juul purchase. 
p64
aVIs there an incentive from pax/juul to claim back used pods from shops? Or is it just a really cool shop, taking a small loss for less litter
p65
aVPax owns juul, as well as the Pax Era, a pod based oil device
p66
aVI work at a local bar and it pains me so much cleaning up the numerous straws, cups and juul pods off the ground throughout the night. 
p67
aVNo way I didn't even know they owned juul.
p68
aVPax created/used to own juul\u000a\u000aJuul split off sometime in 2017
p69
aVI haven't tried the Pax yet, I'm a hardcore Juul user though. I personally can't even step outside of my house without it. If you do get a chance to try to Pax, let me know. 
p70
aV93% THC Distillate Juul Pods (\U0001f300~\U0001f300)
p71
aVA juul still has to vaporize it's nicotine juice shit bro. I'm sure this works no problem. 
p72
aVOn a serious note can anyone ship me and op some juul Pods. My moms credit card keeps getting declined.
p73
aVI used to, but I stopped recently and now have a Juul that i use every day. I rarely smoke anything other than blunts rolled in tobacco leaf wraps anyways so i doubt it was tobacco related. 
p74
aV\u201cwe don\u2019t even smoke\u201d, and when we wanna get together and smoke we say, \u201cYou guys wanna hit the JUUL?\u201d
p75
aVYou should look into getting a Juul vape. For the most part you're addicted to nicotine, not cigarettes, but cigarettes are what will kill you, not nicotine. Juul's are better than most vapes because they are designed for cigarette smokers. 
p76
aVYou\u2019ll be fine man. Got a 2 day suspension from school for getting caught with my juul like a dumb dumb (18, wasn\u2019t using it, someone snitched) and it felt like the worst thing in the world when it happened, but I\u2019m slowly coming to terms. \u000a\u000aKeep your head up mang 
p77
aVI agree completely. That nicotine buzz with the high is just... well... it's just fucking tits. I got a Juul and it's doing a good job replacing the cigarettes. 
p78
aVE-Mole lifestyle. Bust a fat dab then hit the juul and you'll be melting into the flood
p79
aVPut a Juul instead 
p80
aVWent from cigs and blunts to a juul and a dab pen. Healthier on the lungs and who needs to get out of bed to smoke?
p81
aVHaha I\u2019m at a [8.69) rn off the digital except just a juul instead and I\u2019m loving it listening to some Travis Scott, pure bliss
p82
aVYou should be able to put cannabis oil in there as I have seen people do it with Juul pods, not sure if distillate would be too thick or not tho.
p83
aVHmmmm, cigarettes are legal. Juuls are becoming popular with youth now. And they make nicotine vapes. Yes, for sure, nicotine is definitely being outlawed and treated the same.....
p84
aVI feel like I've read juuls pop up several times the past few days. Is it a vape or something?
p85
aVJuuls are like a super concentrated vape. Small, and high doses of nicotine. At least that's the way I understand it
p86
aVHate to burst your bubble but this is much more for people going and juuling/vaping in bathrooms during break period 
p87
aVNic buzz and weed go together well \u000aEdit - by this I mean I hit juuls or nic vapes pretty often when high. Never smoked a spliff or straight tobacco before
p88
aVMaybe consider a Juul?  Maybe you could mix nicotine and THC oil cartridges to get the same effect without the negative consequences of smoking. My buddy smoked a pack a day until he bought a Juul a month ago.  He\u2019s had like two cigarettes since and said they weren\u2019t enjoyable. 
p89
aVMy good friend got a juul. It helps with the craving to smoke and you can get pods without nicotine
p90
aVStiiizy or Pax Era fit in Juul??
p91
aVDab pods for Juul's (illegal state)
p92
aVSounds like he is talking out of his ass. No such thing as 99% pods/carts. And what is it diluted with? Sounds sketchy. Legit juul pods from a dispensary are good. 
p93
aVJuul \u000a
p94
aVPax + some juul rips are amazing if you're a nic fiend.
p95
aVIts made by the juul dudes so it\u2019s basically a juul for THC. Rips. 
p96
aVOh man there's things are real... looks like a juul for concentrates 
p97
aVPax labs developed the juul but Juul has since becomes a separate company (I think) so they are related for sure.
p98
aVYeah that\u2019s the best part about it. Whenever anyone asks about it I\ufe0f just tell them it\u2019s a Juul.
p99
aVYou're missing a juul 
p100
aVA juul is now a unit of measurement.
p101
aVIf you've got 40nic in that juul and hit em both it should be fun
p102
aVIf you aren't using your juul to kick the stoges then you are in fact super gay
p103
aVThere have been these \u201cCBD juul pods\u201d going around at my school that are filled to the brim with synthetic marijuana. First seizure happened today, but it\u2019s fine because at least they weren\u2019t smoking the devils lettuce \U0001f602\U0001f602\U0001f602\U0001f602\U0001f602\U0001f602\U0001f44c\U0001f44c\U0001f44c\U0001f44c\U0001f44c\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBut seriously fuck you Jeff Sessions. Your policies are killing people.  
p104
aVI've hit wax filled juul pods but seriously dont fuck with the synthetic shit.. When I got caught up for weed a few years back when I was in high school I had to do drug classes for 6 months with drug tests every other week so I bought this spice e-liquid that I would drip on my mod. It got me high as giraffe tiddies but I shit you not I would be damn near hallucinating off the stuff, best to stay away from any form of fake weed and stick with the good shit we all know and love
p105
aVLooks like a JUUL what is that exactly 
p106
aVIt\u2019s basically a juul, like the replaceable pods and everything except it\u2019s not e juice it\u2019s wax
p107
aVIt\u2019s basically a thc juul
p108
aVThought you guys would like the new skin I got for my Juul
p109
aVWhat is with all the sudden influx of Juul posts? Can you even vape weed out of them? Damn teenagers.
p110
aVI have an ecig, usually use 3 nicotine. My friend has a Juul and I tried it the other day and almost threw up they hit so strongly! Lots more nicotine than I\u2019m used to!
p111
aVHave this exact skin and made dab juul pods a couple weeks ago. 11/10 would recommend 
p112
aVword i love juul 
p113
aVHow? I hate juuls but they look sick.
p114
aVI made thc e-juice using shatter and wax liquidizer. Then after filtering through a syringe filter, I simply put the juice into my friend\u2019s empty juul pods
p115
aVHe posted his juul skin with pineapples on it. How did he break any rules?
p116
aVThat\u2019s what it feels like rn. I took one hit to test a juul pod I filled and I still feel off like 6 hours later.
p117
aVAre juuls safe?
p118
aVHow is that weird it's nicotine same substance as cigs. Don't go near it because at the end of the day it's definitely not a good thing to be doing health wise and it's really addictive. Trust me I use a Juul now after having dipped for a couple years and it's damn near impossible to stop I get irritable and headaches. Seriously just don't do it.
p119
aVWhy the Juul is an ecig ask are/electronic_cigarette
p120
aVI guess I'm just confused why the Juul is mentioned on trees or vaporents as it has aboslutely nothing to do with weed
p121
aVJuul 
p122
aVOne bong hit for one juul hit...
p123
aVBe careful man. Just read how juuls may increase the risk of cancer. But I guess the bud cancels that out lol
p124
aVah, i know i've heard mixed things. apparently juuls don't have the cancer causing chemical in it? according to the juul subreddit, (I know, reliable source) juuls have not at all been proved to give you cancer and if you tried to tell them otherwise you'd probably get banned lol. I need to take my juuling down a notch though because I definetly am feeling it in my lungs, that's why i'm so willing to give it up to other people now 
p125
aVMy school has that issue, kids in my school have almost fought me in the bathroom cuz they thought I was hitting a juul in my stall. Kinda sad to see high schoolers that don\u2019t realize they\u2019re hurting themselves with this shit. 
p126
aVPeople are always like juuls are fuckin gay only butt chompers smoke juuls but I found one on the ground the other day and bought thing of cartridges and I haven't felt the need to suck down a stoge since 
p127
aVWhat is Juuling? The Most Discreet Vape Pens in the World
p128
aVThc juuls?
p129
aVIt is the Pax Era, a concentrate vaporizer. Basically a juul but for THC. 
p130
aVDid you know that the Juul and this, the Era, are both made by Pax?
p131
aVSame logic would apply to the Juul but that thing took off like a rocket.
p132
aVI did a keif bowl and had a fuck ton of juul hits...[10+(
p133
aVSmoking may irritate your throat, if a juul is a vape (i honestly have no clue what a juul is.  I dab everyday and thought I knew what was what....haha) then you can vape away with no worries.  Smoking with a bong will likely irritate your throat tho
p134
aVThat\u2019s one of the sweetest juul wraps I\u2019ve ever seen, where\u2019d you cop?
p135
aVThe small rectangular thing OP attached to his oil pen is a Juul, essentially an e cig
p136
aVJuul lyfe all day 
p137
aVI have a feeling that due to the slower draw rate of the capsule compared to the Juul this might not work as well as expected but still pretty cool 
p138
aVWhats with these Juul things?\u000a\u000aIt seems like every kid under 18 has one now? Why not just buy a real mod?
p139
aVMan, a couple buddy's and I made a 3 Juul 2 dab pen spliff over the break, called it the Gatling Gun. It's a pretty intense 1-3 minutes after a decent hit.
p140
aVNice skin on juul 
p141
aVJuuls, along with Phix's, Juno's all hit much differently than a traditional vape. A lot of people dont like the way a vape hits. But Juuls specifically hit a lot like a cigarrette. Juno's hit like  something between a vape and a cig. But these devices all have a MUCH higher nicotine content. Theyre great for people trying to quit smoking.
p142
aVYou can fill the juul pod with thc oil?? I'm not sure if that would work very well
p143
aVit's a juul
p144
aVAnd the juul has more nicotine than your regular e cig, and provides a nice buzz
p145
aVHow is the juul? i have been debating getting one to stop cigarettes but dont know anyone who has tried it.
p146
aVI love juuls
p147
aVGet it. Its the best I usually take moles (tobacco and weed in a bong) and never crave it because of the Juul. My cousin is a heavy cigarette smoker and showed her the juul. Now her and all her friends have a juul. Personally I use a sourin drop because juul pods are expensive. I know a lot about e-cigs so dm me if you have in questions.
p148
aVHey man, by chance do you know of any coupon codes for the juul website? 
p149
aVJuul is great for stopping smoking. That said, 1 pod is roughly equivalent to a pack of cigs so be careful not to up your nic intake. 
p150
aVi just got the juul today, im diggin it. last question, can i switch pods back and forth or do i need to finish one at a time? i want to try all the flavors
p151
aVJuul\u2019s are annoying
p152
aVJUUL Pod
p153
aVOne of my friends made a story on Instagram that said "yo pass that juul" or something like that, and I had my juul in my hand. For about 5 minutes I had my hand reached out, and kept telling "him" it was a mango pod.
p154
aVThat juul skin tho 
p155
aVHas he ever thought of vaping? Vaping would be a big help for him to get off the cigs(cancer sticks), look into the JUUL. \u000a\u000ahttps://www.juulvapor.com
p156
aVI would personally recommend you to get him to try it, he could possibly try it and enjoy it. Not to mention in the long run it could possibly save him from getting cancers/diseases from the cancer sticks.\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s some more information on the JUUL if you need more assistance on convincing him:\u000a\u000a\u000aWhat they are made of and how they work:\u000a\u000ahttps://support.juulvapor.com/home/learn/faqs/manufacturing-quality#materials\u000a\u000aHow the juice is heated, actual listed ingredients of what\u2019s within the pods. Unlike cigarettes you actually know what you are inhaling:\u000a\u000ahttps://support.juulvapor.com/home/learn/faqs/juulpods-juice#heating\u000a\u000aIf you can\u2019t help him to make the switch sadly as another redditor said, you can lead a horse to water, but you can\u2019t make them drink.\u000a\u000aGood luck, and please report back if you can.
p157
aVProbably rips a juul 
p158
aVr/juul
p159
aVpax, maybe? although with the juul they are making crazy money off naive high schoolers 
p160
aVTry hemp wraps? It's like a blunt but hemp leaves instead of tobacco ? Blunt wraps could be hard to drop because the tobacco get a juul maybe ? 
p161
aVHow much would you pay for JUUL pods filled with oil?
p162
aVPax, the company that makes the juul, came out with the Pax Era which looks and functions exactly like a juul but with oil. I read somewhere that the battery is ~$60 while the pods are ~$40, but I\u2019m not positive so don\u2019t quote me on that.  Here\u2019s the link if you wanna poke around some more:\u000a\u000ahttps://www.paxvapor.com/era
p163
aVIn my area, we have a couple of guys that sell pods like that. $20 for a Juul one and $30 for a phix since it holds more.
p164
aVIf ur in a legal state get a pax era it's made by same people who make juuls and it is basically a juul with weed pods 
p165
aVJuuling while high is so ethereal
p166
aVThe fuck is Juuling?
p167
aVluv me sum juul
p168
aVHow I find my juul
p169
aVI like to rip my juul a lot when I\u2019m high and the other day I was at about a [7] and lost it, I was looking all over the room and in my pockets before I realized I was holding it between my fingers, then j just started dying of laughter. Good times. 
p170
aVMy man, good luck on quitting cigs!\U0001f4af get a Juul, they\u2019re ecig pens and they\u2019re good at getting you a buzz similar to cigs while taking you away from them. I\u2019ve seen 3 good friends fully quit nicotine overall cause of a Juul.\u000a\u000aBtw this Breakthrough album is pretty great
p171
aVI got a Baton and so far it has been real nice. I didn't want a big mod in my pocket especially in summer and this is perfect. real similar to the juul with a slightly larger battery and different pod design.\u000a\u000aGLK is one of my favorites in the experimental side of trip hop along with Prefuse73 and Flying Lotus. Prefuse keeps it pretty straight but FlyLo can really get out there sometimes as can GLK.
p172
aVBro I was at a 10 when I saw it and all I can remember was being super scared from the hippo and laughing my ass off when the rock said \u201cpass me the juul\u201d

aVThis girl at my school sucked dick for a juul
p174
aVit's a [juul](https://www.juulvapor.com/) - nicotine, not thc, although it's made by the same company that makes the pax 
p175
aVAwesome. Yeah i have a juul as well so this happens to be very convenient. Thank you!!
p176
aVThat shit looks dank, let me know how it works in the juul
p177
aVNo he's correct. Juul don't use normal vape juice it's a nicotine salt that is less thick 
p178
aVUnless you break the lid, no it won\u2019t leak. Treat it like any other juul pod. .75g wax, 1ml vg is what I used
p179
aVHow many pods did that make? a juul pod is only .7 mL
p180
aVThe juul is super easy to refill, and there are videos online, the only problem is I notice (for me at least) that the pod leaks afterwards when you hit it. I got a suorin drop and it refills much better, but I'm not sure if you can put thc juice in it if that's what you're looking for.
p181
aVNice weed juul
p182
aVThe company that produces the Juul also produces Pax Era Vapes that work fantastic in my experience (have had one for the past 11 months without fail)
p183
aVA juul pod is actually 0.7ml. I was able to make 2-3 pods
p184
aVNo i mean more viscous, juuls juice viscosity is similar to your standard vape juice though its a lot less thick due to it having little amounts of vg. When you add dabs to the mix; whether its shatter, butter or what have you, it will dramatically effect the viscosity of vg turning it into a thick molasses like liquid. 
p185
aVThe only thing I dont like is how much it spits juice. Needs some type of filter in the pod like a juul.
p186
aVThat\u2019s not true. You just haven\u2019t tried with one in your mouth enough times. \u000a\u000aMy phone recognizes me with my juul and a joint in my mouth. 
p187
aVIf I smoke and then hit the juul (I know it\u2019s cringe) that\u2019s how i feel. Maybe something with the mixing of nicotine and weed causes that
p188
aVI was mainly saying cringe about the juul cause most people who smoke juuls are very cringy (idk if this sentence even makes sense lol [7])
p189
aVNah, I get it. I'm very aware of the stereotype, I just try not to immediately apply it to people without knowing them. \u000a\u000a...But... According to Twitter, all of Juuls customers are super girly, 20-year-old college sophmores who get drunk every day and hide both habits from their parents. \u000a\u000aI'm just glad that people started making fun of them and now I can "blow clouds" in peace, lmao. 
p190
aVJuul + dank bud = heaven
p191
aVRick and morty juul + pineapple hat = ultimate clout?
p192
aVI juul too dunno if that could be a cause tho 
p193
aVI heard the coils in Juuls release harmful chemicals like arsenic. I would hope though that after a decade of vapes in the market that they have found the best option for the heating element. 
p194
aVI know that Stiizy sells syringes for their pods, so if you already have a Juul or like a pod system, you could just inject the syringe in. I would assume this would also work backwards, using the Stiizy pods with ejuice. However, I would have to caution you, marijuana wax requires less heat to dissipate, than ejuice, so be careful when you do this.\u000a\u000aA better alternative would be to get a mod that's able to take your normal cartridges and your sub tank for vaping, but that might be more costly.
p195
aVYou may just want to get a Pax Era. Or get another juul and fill your own pods. I tried sticking to one device, granted I use carts with 510 threading, and it got a little tiring having to constantly switch between nic and thc. It may be less of a hassle with pods though, especially if you only switch them a few times a day. 
p196
aVIf u do this with juul ik it\u2019s a pain in the ass leaks And fucks up ur juul 
p197
aVHempods bro. Hempods for the Juul. /u/Hempod and @Hempod on Instagram. Go to his website in the bio and purchase some empty pods and try that. This should solve the problem of wanting one device for both nicotine and THC or CBD. 
p198
aVI live in the US, but I'm still gonna answer. Back in high school (Just graduated this month!), I used to keep my pens and cartridges alongside my vape kit (nicotine) in an old PSP case. So whenever a friend would ask if they could borrow my pen, they would say, "Hey can I see your PSP?" And I'd pull it out in front of the teachers and give it to my friend.\u000a\u000aAnother code word we used was "Juul." We closed it that because of the meme where middle schoolers would Juul in their bathrooms, and one of the memes said, "Why are there toilets in the Juul Room?" And that kinda stuck. It also didn't help we also got Stiizy batteries, which we also called a Juul.
p199
aVSometimes, pssh, try every fucking freshmen in school was either hitting a juul sorin or some kind of mod like they needed the nicotine to survive at my school. You walk into a bathroom your blind from the vapor at least in class everyone was a little more discreet
p200
aVDepending where u end up if you decide to attend, it either gets way worse or way better lmao. Miami Ohio here, the place where the term juul is most searched in the whole world \U0001f602
p201
aVYeyeye, now that I think abt it it was cedar with hints of grape. And some mango cuz it was an old mango juul pod
p202
aVJuul is ejuice right? I wonder how the purity/potency compares to distillate carts; probably not very favorably.
p203
aVAccording to my dealer, the carts have better hits and flavor. Also because of the juul battery, it\u2019s not specifically for thc. I\u2019m buying thc carts next
p204
aVIts your body so i cant say for sure, but if you take small hits and maybe even juul after you should be good. Water might help too
p205
aVwait what. You can get THC juul pods? How???
p206
aVTHC Juul pod 94% THC
p207
aVWoah does this actually work on a juul 
p208
aVI was just thinking recently about how great a thc Juul pod would be 
p209
aVPax, which is owned by the same company as Juul, has the Pax Era which is very similar to the juul in size and has THC.
p210
aVI totally thought the pax Era and the Juul looked too simular to not have the same cartridge. 
p211
aVThey are very different shapes and the carts don't work together. I think the point he was trying to make was that they are made by the same company. So the Era kind of IS a thc Juul lol
p212
aVI love sitting in class charging my juul, and the homie behind me hits me with that line.
p213
aVSo to everyone asking if these are easy, I can do you one better, look up the Kandypens Rubi. It\u2019s basically a Juul but the pods are made to be refillable and the coils are strong enough you can fill it with distillate and it almost works better than a pen. My local delivery sells them with 95% pods and they\u2019re incredble, highly recommend.
p214
aVSame with juul and most miniature vape companies unfortunately :/ I definitely think Pax is the safest option, they just make their pods fucking impossible to fill 
p215
aVthe stiiizy is the best 'thc juul' out there :) 
p216
aVHey I\u2019m PMing about the guy in Vegas who does THC Juul pods?
p217
aVJuul got too expensive for me.
p218
aVglad you figured that out sooner vs later. $4.25 / pod, 0.7ml / pod. 30ml worth of juice = $180 ion Juul pods\u000a\u000aI typically get 8-12 refills per Drop pod
p219
aVI\u2019ve been spending so much on juuls I need to switch
p220
aVOoze slim pen touchless battery... All you do is suck on the cartridge like a juul lol.
p221
aVOh God yes. I have a Sourin Drop (Kind of like a Juul, in that it is small and has a high nicotine content) and when I'm high I go at it nonstop
p222
aVbro bro bro\u000ais that a juul?
p223
aVLemme hit your Juul man please man just one hit 
p224
aVYa search how to use a juul pod without a battery on YouTube. Same concept but red wire in the hole and black on the outside
p225
aVCan someone explain the hype abt the juuls to me? They\u2019re just nicotine pens?
p226
aVIf you have a juul, pour the oil into a pod and hit it like a normal juul pod. Works like a charm
p227
aVthe trick is to start hitting the dab pen before you put the juul in your mouth
p228
aVFinally got a Pax 2. Bowl of black lime reserve, also a cucumber juul pod!
p229
aVI'm an Texan also. I feel you on the nicotine I need my reds.  If you want you can refill your Juul pod.  On the side there  Small plastic clamps that hold top to the bottom together is a small screwdriver to pry the part  YouTube it
p230
aVMarket Test: Empty/Used JUUL POD\u2019s for reverse engineering
p231
aVThese pods are for the JUUL Vaporiser. The JUUL is specifically designed for tobacco use but can be modified to accept other E-Juices or oils. I think you are looking for the PAX Era. The PAX Era uses pod's like the JUUL but the pods for the Era have cannabis concentrates in them. Both the JUUL &amp; Era are owned by the same company (which also owns leafly.com) but are supposed to do two different things. 
p232
aVMy post here is for some market research to see if there is even a market for empty JUUL pods. I have 102 pods right now &amp; I can obtain more in bulk if there is a market for them &amp; the price is right. 
p233
aVI would be interested for oil. I don't do nicotine anymore but I would love to try some oil in them and see how they work. Empty pax era pods would be even better because we know they work great for oil but I would be willing to give juul pods a try. Juul was my favorite device when I Vaped. 
p234
aVThanks for insight. Going to start experimenting with a higher CBD ratio. \u000a\u000aWhere are good places to look for CBD vape oils and which type of vape I would use? This is still eh to me because I have a juul and batteries for my THC carts. \u000a\u000aI\u2019m thinking about trying the droppers to for CBD. 
p235
aVthe juul \U0001f440
p236
aVA Juul is an electric cig. It has nothing to do with this sub
p237
aVJuuls are fuckin stupid man. I vape and it's just so fucking stupid. 
p238
aVThank you so much! I\u2019m in college with roommates so it\u2019s good to hear about the less smell thing! This might be a stupid question, but is the Juul also used for vaping? It\u2019s just what I see everyone using but maybe it\u2019s just for regular nicotine smoking. 
p239
aVI have no idea what a \u201cJuul\u201d is. \u000aThat\u2019s one for the peeps over at r/vaporents  \U0001f601\u000a\u000aBut as far as the semi goes, if you wanna be 99% discreet, a good vape and having a session in the bathroom with the shower/fan going (both is a perfect combo) is a suuuuupr discreet way.  Plus getting baked and having a shower is excellent \U0001f44c
p240
aVMy friend had just picked up some shatter and a dabox. I took about 6 dabs and was rocked probably a [8]. I was going to a vape shop to get juul pods and I walked in and asked \u201cdo y\u2019all have tide pods\u201d
p241
aVBad juul!! Bad!!
p242
aVthat juul skin is sexy af 
p243
aVBut what's your favorite flavor Juul pod tho
p244
aVPut it in yo juul
p245
aVBro plz, let me hit ur juul 
p246
aVThis is actually the first time I've seen a juul in a trees post
p247
aVbought a juul for the soul purpose of having it when i smoked and let me tell you it was the best investment i\u2019ve ever made. nothing beats good weed and nicotine. 
p248
aVGet a juul
p249
aVrelax it's not cartridge it's juul vape pens.
p250
aVThat\u2019s a dope looking juul my man. 
p251
aVThat juul is dope
p252
aVThanks! I just took a random sticker I had and cut it up to fit around the juul lol
p253
aVNicotine is definitely not the only thing in cigarettes that make it addictive. Like what the first guy said, nicotine on it's own isn't really addictive unless it is used in higher quantities such as a juul. What's incredibly addictive about cigarettes are the other many chemicals companies put in. 
p254
aVJuul hits are great when your high \U0001f44c
p255
aVHitting the juul after smoking is my favorite thing to do when I smoke
p256
aVi\u2019m in texas so you can imagine why the laws are so strict.\u000a\u000aas for vaping, i went out and bought a juul a few days after i was arrested\U0001f602
p257
aVDoes Anyone Know If Oil Pods are Being Made For a Juul?
p258
aVThey make pods for a pax era I believe. Pax makes Juul.
p259
aVlol idk if it\u2019s like that everywhere but around me every gas station and convenience store has cigarillos, cones, wraps, anything u need really even juuls and pods
p260
aVHow might you make/get THC distillate in a state like Georgia (where i live) where it is illegal? I\u2019ve heard you can put the distillate in a JUUL pod and rip it like you would anything else. Don\u2019t slaughter me if i\u2019m completely wrong...
p261
aVda JUUL in da backround got some nice skin
p262
aVDude thanks! I use to hella make fun of juuls but now I\u2019m hooked 
p263
aVGet him a juul
p264
aVI think that was just a juul, he usually smokes cigs during sets but I\u2019m guessing the venue wasn\u2019t cool with that.
p265
aVI\u2019m I med patient from ca flying to Chicago next month and want to bring my stiiizy pen, looks just like a juul... you think I would be ok? How should I transport the cartridges?
p266
aVAll through high school I smoked out of bongs. Definitely my go - to. And I smoked a lot especially my first year of college. Morning - bong rip, leaving for class- rip, after class - rip, going to work - rip etc... \u000aOccasionally I would smoke a joint if that\u2019s what was a round, and rarely a blunt, because those highs were just \u201cdifferent\u201d to me. Now, I really don\u2019t smoke at all anymore - I mainly started smoking dirty bowls , so with tobacco- and after I got my JUUL I stopped wanting cigarettes and tobacco altogether so weed went with it. \u000a \u000aI still once a month will smoke with my boyfriend, but only if it\u2019s a joint!!! I refuse to hit a bong now even though that\u2019s what I swore by. \u000a\u000aI guess it\u2019s all about what you\u2019re used too \U0001f937\U0001f3fc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\U0001f937\U0001f3fc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f
p267
aVLooks like a juul
p268
aVIt is indeed a juul. Trying to quit cigs. Started chain smoking when my dad was diagnosed with a brain tumor, then cancer. It's been helping out a lot so far.
p269
aVNow that's a juul I could vape in the middle school bathroom. 
p270
aVjuuls are so bad for you, also it depends i feel dabs make me cough way more than flower
p271
aVAll about the ratios. I'm not sure with you but juuls hits way harder than a cig. But you're right. A fat mole is like a different category. You can't blackout from a juul lol
p272
aVNahhh. If anything most people end up using it more. Same logic applies to the Juul, in that because it's discreet, there's a tendency to take it out and use it more frequently. \u000a\u000aAll the drivers and most of the cooks at my side job are using both throughout their shifts, as an anecdotal example. 
p273
aVIt\u2019s a JUUL a new way of smoking nicotine 
p274
aVdamn you got some fancy gas stations in your town... JUULs aren\u2019t high-tech top-shelf vapes, but you definitely won\u2019t find them next to bics and clippers at your local 7-eleven
p275
aVI'd argue that the Juul is one of the best E-cigs on the market currently. Granted I'm not a big user of E-cigs, but they are discreet, compact, and reliable. They juice in them is stronger than most E-cigs, and many smokers have said that the Juul is one of the only E-cigs that can scratch that cigarette itch. \u000a\u000aIt's not a box mod for sure, but it's not trying to be. It's a quick, easy, and discreet way to get a nice hit of nicotine. 
p276
aVJuul buzz + high af = full body orgasm
p277
aVif u juul just put it in pods lol 
p278
aVMy jaw locks up when I smoke weed. Am I just being a hypochondriac or do I have jaw cancer.. I also smoked cigs for a few years and now just smoking a juul.
p279
aVI\u2019ve found myself hitting my juul after smoking as well. I try to shy away from it because nicotine buzzes can be acquired fairly easily where as I\u2019d rather just enjoy the high from bud alone
p280
aVJuul ent gang
p281
aVFirst of all you could get cancer tomorrow why the hell are you saying you won't get cancer if you wait 5-10 years from now ? Do you think you can only get cancer if your older then 30? Why can't you just quit cigs and only smoke weed? There should be no reason why you can't only smoke weed, cigarettes do not make weed more enjoyable. You could try switching to vaping / juuling, maybe your parents would approve of that.
p282
aVHey man your juul deserves to be pictured too! 
p283
aVMy guess is that the cops care about it about as much as they care about public drinking. \u000a\u000aGo pick up a Pax Era battery and Pod. And a couple more to mail back home. It\u2019s an excellent system, mostly only available in rec states, and from a cops POV, he can\u2019t tell the difference between an Era and a Juul(different divisions of the same company.)\u000a\u000aYou won\u2019t regret it.
p284
aVI\u2019m in the same boat- I had 1 (only one I had) almost fully grown in wisdom tooth out on Monday. It was a three minute procedure (literally. He waited two minutes after giving me novocaine and then pulled it out in under a minute) and I\u2019ve had almost no pain. My dentist told me I could hit my Juul the next day. \u000a\u000aSo I started hitting a weed vape (king pen) last night as well as the juul- I\u2019ve been not sealing my mouth around them, just inhaling and getting small direct to lung hits.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m super nervous but so far it\u2019s been ok. \u000aMy dentist said dry sockets are much more common in people whose wisdom teeth were impacted, needed surgery, or were otherwise hard to get out. He said my wound would be really small and I shouldn\u2019t stress about it- but ofc I still am! I accidentally hit a spliff my bf passed me last night and didn\u2019t feel anything weird either, but going to wait a few days before I do that again.\u000aGood luck with your nose dabs! 
p285
aVI had a super powerful gram cart on this dab pen that I took apart to work on a cart\u000aIt\u2019s all I had plus my juul for a weekend of skiing\u000aFrom getting high for eating and for fucking rapidly sliding on ice/snow it was pretty fun\u000a\u000aSadly tbh weed doesnt make skiing that much better\u000aBut it more makes (personally/me) you a pussy \u000aAs in super scared to go down steep slopes \u000aAnd I would take it way to slow accelerating for like one second and just parallel turning all the way to the other side repeat\u000a\u000aThe main reason is I got high with my buddy and could find the same intermediate trail as before and accidentally took the wrong turn\u000aIt had nothing to do with being high we just didn\u2019t remember \u000a\u000aIt was fun and no better feeling when i got down tho\u000a(Basically had to stop a couple times mid slope because my asthma was killing me and I got little panic attacks - not too bad just it scared the shit out of be to be on like a veteran slope as a person who hasn\u2019t skied in 3 years and did it for the first time TODAY) I picked skiing up quick tho\u000a
p286
aVGirlfriends son smokes weed and is completely unproductive and uncaring about anything or anyone else but himself. Got into it not long ago due to following the cue of what other kids do on social media. He has no life skills and it seems no ambition. It mostly stems from the over glorification of marijuana on social media. Im 38. When I smoked weed as a kid I also did other productive things.i did well in school. I was very active in sports. I didnt sit around smoking weed and staring at a phone and proclaim my own greatness. I hope in the next year he figures some things out because I have a three year old that wont be exposed to an ungrateful unproductive bad influence. He's out the door with zero life skills. He can sit somewhere else with his goofy and not so bright friends and smoke weed and get high off his juul all damn day somewhere else.
p287
aVCustomers photo of a 94% THC Juul pod and a quarter g 94% cartridge
p288
aVNever knee they made Juul pods thought they were Pax Era pods. DOPE!
p289
aVJuul makes vapes that use these pods
p290
aVI just tried to plug my phone charger into my JUUL [6}
p291
aVSanded my juul then added some of my favorite molecules
p292
aVUpvote for imagination but i gotcha say Juuls suck donkey dick 
p293
aVIm just saying u will like them because u can save alot of money man i threw my juul in the garbage when i got my Rolo Badge 
p294
aVJuuls literally rip ur wallet out ur pocket and i regret wasting hundreds of dollars on there shitty juice flavors 
p295
aVNice! I tried turning my juul gold once but I broke it in the process \U0001f622
p296
aVY did u post a juul on a weed subreddit
p297
aVI got a pet pig for Christmas last year, and on it\u2019s 3rd day in our house, it dragged an empty juul pod pack out from under my bed in front of my parents
p298
aVYes! It\u2019s a Juul 
p299
aVit\u2019s pretty cool i prefer the juul so far kinda taste burnt it could just be the harsh juice definitely not a bad purchase though
p300
aVJuuls suck yo u need to upgrade to Smok Rolo Badge they are better just a recommendation cuz u will save more money 
p301
aVFunny. As another comment suggested, I highly recommend you try a JUUL. I'd almost bet you that it would help you with quitting.
p302
aV1 week without a cig with my JUUL as of tomorrow. It is definitely the most comparable feeling to actually dragging on a cig in my opinion.  Blu never worked for me and I\u2019d tried several friends vapes. So far so good. 
p303
aVHonestly the only thing that kept me off of cigs was the JUUL. I didn't want to be one of those people but I am. I don't crave cigs tho!
p304
aVWhy do you need a juul
p305
aVMinus the juul
p306
aVI get both.  Juul is nice while I\u2019m working but off the clock I end up overdoing it and I just feel sick.
p307
aVlol @ juul haters
p308
aVIs it possible to unscrew a cartridge and flip the oil into a juul pod?
p309
a.
