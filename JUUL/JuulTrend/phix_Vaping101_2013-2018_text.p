VRefillable Pod Mod Recommendations\u000a\u000aI need help with some pod mod recommendations. I have a phix, juul, sourin air, drop, and i-share, aspire breeze and also the smok fit and infinix. I wanted to know if there are any pod mods that are refillable but keep that small and sleek design like the juul. I was looking at the rubi by kandypens but it's expensive and I've heard they can break easily.
