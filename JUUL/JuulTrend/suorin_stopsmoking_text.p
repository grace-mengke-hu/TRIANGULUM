VI've been smoking cigarettes for 30 years &amp; weed for 20. Now using a Suorin Air vape to quit smoking. Quit date is 2 days from now. And a Clear oil pen for weed. My dad passed away at 63 from cancer. I don't want to take that same road.

aVSweet. I just filled my sourin drop vape with the last of my 50mg juice. After this is gone I'm going cold turkey. Been using about a pod full a day for 3 months now. It got me off cigs but this shit feels way more controling. We. Can do it. 
p2
aVFor about 7 years I NEVER got past day 6-9. I\u2019m now 34 days without a single cigg, and what totally turned things around was buying a Suorin Drop. It\u2019s not the perfect solution because there is still some tobacco. But it got me through every craving. Now I\u2019m even at the point where I only use it once or twice every 3 or 4 days. I can honestly say it has made quitting 10000 times easier, I genuinely don\u2019t want a cig anymore

aVIf you know you're going to relapse, you could at least do it with a vape. Suorin, Juul, Smok Rolo all feel close to a cigarette when you use strong nicotine salts. That's what I'm doing right now. I'm considering smoking an emergency that needs to stop immediately, and I can deal with quitting the vape eventually. I just know myself and going cold turkey is a bad plan for me.

aVI hate cigarettes now, so it\u2019s great and I feel like I won\u2019t go back to anything that smells as bad as smokes now. It\u2019s a means to an end and I am determined to not go back to cigarettes.\u000a\u000aTo be honest though, it took me a while to get back to vaping because I started with this big kit 5 years ago, but it was a mid/low nicotine level (sorry, I don\u2019t remember) with no side effects. Then a couple years ago when marlboro came out with their vape pen, I tried it and it made me feel worse than cigarettes especially with cardio, so I stopped.\u000a\u000aBut I finally went to a shop, and asked all my questions there. I got this [no button pen type vape](https://www.suorinusa.com/products/suorin-vagon) w/35mg salt nicotine (which I hear is smoother, and I liked more than the other stuff) that hits pretty smooth, and while it\u2019s not the same nicotine high, it\u2019s just for those panicky I need a smoke type moments, and it\u2019s getting me through the day.\u000a\u000aI guess I\u2019ve accepted that nothing is ever going to be like a cigarette, and I\u2019m still a little hooked to the idea of smoking, but I\u2019m getting over it. Vaping is my crutch in the meantime and I\u2019m glad I found one that\u2019s helping me get there.

aVIf you're having a hard time quitting completely, there is always the option of getting an e-cig or vape. These are no doubt much healthier and the cost is definitely lower. Nicotine isn't the harmful part of ciggs, it's the chemicals. This is just an option if you're finding it impossible to quit, if you can quit completely then awesome! If not, I would recommend checking out products such as the JUUL or Suorin Air. Search "VapeGodShop" on google and you can browse what we have to offer. Use code "reddit10" at checkout for 10% off. Quit smoking, it's the best thing you can do to live longer and happier.

aVPeople can make fun all they want but the fact of the matter is that I was addicted to nicotine and chose to stop. I started with the juul in college and later got a suorin on 50mg of nic. Loved the fucking thing but it had to go
p8
aVHey! Struggling still, but haven\u2019t puffed a smoke. Hitting a suorin vape and it\u2019s helping tremendously. 
p9
aVYou might not need a whole giant rig, I've been using the suorin Air(it's literally business card sized) and it packs a punch.
p10
aVThose little Vapes are great (IMO) I got a suorin Air and am very impressed.
p11
aVJUULS are great, I have one too. However I am wanting to get a Sourin only because you can buy different juices for the Sourin with a lower Nic content 
p12
aVGood for you! I went from cigarettes to a juul to a little refillable sourin air. I\u2019m going to start cutting out nic as soon as the current bottle of juice I have is empty. I\u2019m pretty excited to give it a try
p13
aVI wouldn't suggest it. I use a suorin drop with salt, and any time I get it in my mouth it tastes terrible. Non salt juices don't taste too bad and have a lower nicotine content. I have no idea the implicationsof applying it directly to your gums otherwise, but it doesn't seem like it would be pleasant on a regular basis. 
p14
aVJuul pods are crazy expensive. I\u2019d recommend getting a sourin drop and buying your own nic salts if you don\u2019t wanna break the bank
p15
aVYeah I had a suorin for a bit but I would just rip that legit all the time haha. It\u2019s soo convenient
p16
aVRight?? My withdrawals from cigs right now are way easier than my suorin withdrawals last quarter.
