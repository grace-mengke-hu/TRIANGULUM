VI've been vaping 45mg salt nic out if a suorin and it gives me more of a buzz than any cigarette I've had in a while. Trying to cut down on smokes
p1
aVMy e-cig is tiny (Sourin Drop, so actually pretty similar to a Juul, except mine is refillable with fluid) and it works.\u000a\u000aJust take a drag, hold it in with your eyes shut (I try to hold it to the count of 20, or just however long I want, not an exact science by any means), then slowly blow it back out. I dunno how it works, but I feel calmer. Sometimes a get a little nic buzz.
p2
aVOk so I used vapes mostly, but I\u2019ve used 5 pod systems before. I\u2019ve used the sourin air, the sourin vagon, the hiro, the sourin drop, and the juul. Personally, all of them but the juul work really well, but it\u2019s about how you want the draw. The sourin vagon has a really loose pull that lets out a lot of smoke. It\u2019s almost a little tiny box mod, but the battery gets burnt out super fast, however. The coils might outlast the product (i swear to god). The sourin drop and air have similar pulls (the drop being a tad bit looser and the air being closer to pulling on a packed american spirit) as far as flavor goes for pod systems though, I have yet to find one as good as the hiro. I dunno if they still make them, but they are BEEFY. Super long lasting battery, coils have a decent life span, and actually a super clean flavor. \u000a\u000aI\u2019d type more but I\u2019m on mobile. Did you want to know more about box mods or were you thinking more about pods? Box mods or standard vapes are going to be anything from a 1.5 mg to an 18 mg where as pods are more 25 to 50(depending where you live adjusted higher or lower for legality). It just depends on your nici tolerance.

aVYeah, i would suggest sourin air if youre also economically saving as well, same salt nic and more juice!

aVhttps://www.elementvape.com/geek-vape-nova-200w-tc-starter-kit?enter=true\u000a\u000a\u000a^^^my roommate quit with this.  It hits hard with a 6mg nic, but not in an  unpleasant way.   The pic doesn't do it justice, very classy looking set up. Having a mod for at home and a salt nic vape (juul, suorin, etc.) for when on the go, you'll have the best odds of quitting 
p5
aValso you should invest in a decent vape. i use the suorin air and i haven\u2019t bought a pack of cigarettes since i owned it. it\u2019s a lot more cost effective too, a bottle of salt nic juice can last you a solid month 
p6
aVDamn must hate me then lol I have a suorin rn. Used to have a juul but once I stopped getting much of a buzz I sold it at cost and got a suorin for a stronger buzz. However, nothing compares to the nostalgia of a nice dart
p7
aVIncreased headbuzz with Marlboro Gold?\u000a\u000aI've heard this around the grapevine from many smokers I know, and I just picked up a pack today to try it out. It was my first smoke of the day, but I got a narly head buzz. I smoke around 4-7 cigarettes a day, and lately even the first cig of the day doesn't give me a buzz (I've started vaping to cut down on smoking, and nothing beats the first 3 hits from my Suorin). Surely some of you must have heard this or even experienced it, so is there an explanation as to why so many people believe Marlboro Golds give a stronger buzz than full flavor cigarettes?
p8
aVbro don\u2019t smoke inside. your house will reek of cigarette smoke permanently and there\u2019s a 90% chance your land lord won\u2019t let you do it anyway.  regardless of how high-quality your cigs are, the smell will always be kinda trashy imo. just but a juul or suorin for indoors, save the cigarettes for the porch. trust me, i\u2019ve lived in an apartment with 5 other smokers and it\u2019s not fun to have your home smell like smoldering cigarettes 24/7 365.
p9
aVIf you're willing to give vaping a try, the Juul and Suorin Drop are both satisfying pod vapes, as well as good entry level devices. Salt juices will probably get you buzzed if you choose a high enough nic level; For example: 65 mg/mL. \u000a\u000aIf you'd prefer cigs, consider a tolerance break. 
p10
aVbout to pick up a Suorin myself, but i\u2019ll definitely still buy packs here n there
p11
aVi have a sourin with 30 mg nic and smoke thc regularly. My family is prone to being addicted to nicotine but not me. I smoke that so i dont smoke and be high all the time.. Considering switching to 0nic. I just like the smoke. The head rush is good and then you smoke too much and its a painful cycle for your brain. Never been a fan of cigarettes, or found the appeal or relaxation almost everyone claims they receive. I get full on anxious and i think its just not for me. I know this is old but i stumbled upon it. 
p12
aVnot really, at least I know i\u2019m over it. fulfilling the craving isn\u2019t worth the taste of a cigarette. I will probably just get another juul or sourin or whatever to fulfill the craving next time. 
p13
aVSame ive been vaping nic salts out of a kangertech evod fir a while and swear up and down that its better than a juul, sourin, drop, any if that shit, and soo much cheaper
p14
aVWhile it definitively won\u2019t give you the same feeling, the 70 mg nicotine juice I get for my suorin has me soaring like a cigarette never did. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s the only way I could get domed to the point of not being able to open my eyes let alone stand up when I was regularly smoking NAS blacks.
p15
aVI need help. I was using a suorin drop to get off of cigarettes. My brother lost it and I have gone without nicotine in 3 days. I\u2019m craving nicotine rn and need help.\u000a\u000aMy brother has a pack of camels but he refuses to let me smoke them for no reason. It\u2019s his fault he lost the suorin and i\u2019m freaking out.
p16
aVnormally I would tell anyone your age to just not get into cigarettes or nicotine in general, as it can and will turn into a habit that you didn\u2019t wish you had, especially when starting at 16. But, nic clearly works for you and you\u2019ve already got the bug so I\u2019m not gonna tell you to stop smoking (also I started at 17 so who am I to talk). My advice to you is to maintain a very acute level of self awareness when it comes to your smoking. Before you light every cig, ask yourself if you REALLY need it right now. Do you REALLY need that level of relaxation right now, or is there something else you can do to take your mind off things ? I only say this because once I got acquainted with the feeling of nicotine at 17, \u201cone or two cigs at night to take the edge off\u201d turned into two smoke sessions a day, then three, then close to a pack a day as I was just smoking whenever I could. Chalk this up as 50% straight up good ole fashioned nicotine addiction/50% stress from school+work and not having the energy to do anything else in my spare time. I feel like if I had stopped to think before lighting up my first daylight smoke \u201cI should probably save this for later\u201d I wouldn\u2019t have gotten to the point I did. But I lit it, figured \u201chell it works for me all the time, day or night\u201d and that marked the turning point where I no longer smoked to take the daily load of stress off my mind, I was just smoking because I could and I didn\u2019t like the feeling of having not smoked in a while. If you can have the foresight to moderate your usage before you build up a tolerance and keep the nicotine fiend in your brain from winning all the time, I can guarantee you will save yourself a lot of money and mucus down the road.  \u000aAlso, look into nic salt vaping if you\u2019re getting shit from your parents. A Suorin drop and a bottle of 50mg juice will cost you the same as a couple packs and will last you a pretty long while. no smell/no lingering taste/you don\u2019t even need to go outside to use it, although I will say it can be much harder to moderate nicotine usage when you can do it anywhere, so keep that in mind. But you\u2019re parents will be none the wiser, you can even tell them you \u2018quit\u2019 for brownie points. If you have no interest in gaping, at least consider rolling your own smokes unless money isn\u2019t a factor. \u000aSorry for the rant and I\u2019m sorry if I sound condescending, that\u2019s not my intention at all. I just saw this post and a lot of things came to mind that I wish someone had told me when I started.  \u000a  \u000aTL;DR : smoke responsibly and thoughtfully. Don\u2019t let it turn into something you just do for no real reason. If I had known just exactly how nicotine addiction creeps up on you, I would saved myself a lot of money and it wouldn\u2019t have become the crutch that it did. 
p17
aVI feel you! It's like five minutes of just peace and quiet with nothing to distract me. However your health is important! I would switch to a juul or sourin. It's not the same, but it's close enough. If it made you feel better maybe only smoke cigarettes on the weekend and on the weekdays juul? The guilt sometimes makes me feel worse about myself so that's how I deal with it.
p18
aVlook for juice made with nicotine salts, those are smoother and usually have higher nic content. they're made mostly for juuls or other similar vapes like the suorin air/drop
p19
aVYeah but I did cut back a lot. Since I started vaping it went from a pack and a half a day to a pack every 4-5 days. Btw not the huge robocock vapes I have a juul and a suorin air with salt nicotine juice.
p20
aVYah I'm in the process of getting a sourin air rn bc Juul pods are overpriced and refilling them is annoying
p21
aVA similar option to the Aspire Breeze, and what I use every day, is the Suorin Drop. It's stupid easy to charge and refill, you buy refillable "pods" to plug into the battery and just hit it like a cigarette. Similar to the Juul which is popular as far as the gas station stuff goes, but you're not locked down to a small handful of flavors.\u000a\u000aIt's all about finding what works for you, vaping can be a full blown hobby or it can just be something that takes five minutes of maintenance a day.
p22
aVIf anyone is interested i am a really big fan of the Suorin products. They Suorin Air and Drop are both very small, and use nicotine salt e-juice, which can be as high as 50mg. In my opinion they are both better than the Juul, as they can be refilled with your own juice. 
p23
aVI\u2019ve noticed that I can hit the suorin all day and if I smoke a cig I still get a buzz. The nicotine must get in the system differently in a cig than from a suroin
