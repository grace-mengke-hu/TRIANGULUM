VGo hard and get yourself a vicious ant duke or an axis vapes m17 and for a tank a taifun gt3 or kayfun prime. On a more serious note it depends what you want. If you want something that feels like a cigarette sourin air and something bigger and badder if say no clue.

aVWell anything that has proprietary pods prefilled with juice will add up, cost wise, over time. The breeze, icare, and sourins all allow you to use your own juice for refilling which will greatly reduce your costs. I would also recommend checking out the mi-pod and mi-one which are great little devices. Refillable and relatively inexpensive with positive reviews. Element vape has both models priced at around 25 bucks right now which is a great deal. The mi-one takes a great many types of small aio coils so you would have no trouble finding them. \u000a\u000aGood luck!

aVHow is the iCare 2? I\u2019d like to pick one up but the low price makes me worried it\u2019ll shit the bed after a week like my Suorin Air did.

p9
aVYou're not really supposed to use salt nicotine e juice on a rda or other sub-ohm device. This is because usually too much power is running through it for high concentrations of nicotine and you need to be careful about overdoing it. Salt nicotine e juice are meant for devices like the sourin air, juno, juul, etc. You can find many of these devices in vape shops or online. The key difference between one of these devices and your rda is that the ohms (resistance) is much higher and the power is much power. This let's the device have a harder pull so it feels more similar to a cigarette. Useful for people trying to quit. I would not recommend using salt nicotine e juice on an rda, that just sounds like trouble if you ask me.

aVI dropped my Suorin and now every time I take a hit there is a really loud consistent crackling sound, any ideas on what happened?
p11
aVIt's a suorin drop. It's basically a huge upgrade on the suorin air, both being mouth to lung devices that work best as stealthy lil nic monsters.

aVGet him a sourin air they are pretty cheap and easy to carry 
p15
aVFor me, it helped out a lot more than a traditional ecig as far as quitting cigarettes. I was running a TFV12 Battlestar combo before and the vape was fantastic. Excellent flavor and vapor production; however, I felt I\u2019d have to sit and chain vape for far too long to get a buzz. With the Suorin tho, I can get a solid buzz from 1 or 2 puffs. It really just depends what you\u2019re looking for in your vape.\u000a\u000aTLDR: better for the buzz
p16
aVI've went through quite a few mtl devices like the breeze.\u000a\u000a\u000a-Limitless pulse is a great pod pen that is basically a long juul that is refillable.\u000a\u000a-Icare2 is a pretty good mtl that is a great upgrade to the 1 despite having iffy coils\u000a\u000a-Vaporesso Aurora is a nifty zippo like mtl that looks like a slightly bigger zippo lighter\u000a\u000a-Phix is kinda garbage and tried to live off the juul hype but due to overpriced pods and difficult refilling the prejuiced pods I can't recommend it\u000a\u000a-Suorin Air is my current mtl nic salt mod and I really like it. Basically a thicker credit card with auto pull but I have heard mixed reviews about the coils.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAll of these I can add more to but I'm on mobile and didn't want to type forever for no reason.
p17
aVCan you lung hit a suorin air?
p18
aVIf I was to recommend anything to a starter you could either go the route of a All in one system (means the battery, tank, and mod is all one unit) such as a Aspire Breeze, juul, or suorin air. Buttttttt I would strongly suggest getting a Smoant Charon and a Crown III tank. You will need to buy batteries and a battery charger tho (which may not be the route you wish to take at this early of a stage)\u000a\u000aI would suggest going to YouTube and searching \u201cAIO vape mod\u201d and starting from there. YouTube is your best friend in this situation.\u000a\u000aElement vape \u000aVaporDNA \u000aThose are two very good sites\u000a
p19
aVNp. Head over to the sidebar of r/electronic_cigarette for more useful links. Most beginners are recommended with vape pens (all in ones) or pods (juul, suorin, etc) for starters. Try to avoid Smok products. Though some may have good experiences with them, a lot of threads with issues have been and still being posted. With their mass production comes with poor/unreliable quality. GL!

aVReliable site to buy suorin air vape?
p21
aVDropped my Suorin Air in a cup of water...
p22
aVThe coil/cotton only lasts 5 or so fills before needing replacement. I use the Suorin Air, ICare Mini, Aspire Breeze and others and they all need new coils after about a week. Time is a bad measure because it\u2019s different for everyone and it\u2019s actual puffs that matter. The cotton in most coils will last about 2000 hits or so, give or take. When I was chain vaping, I was lucky to get three days off a coil. Now that I\u2019m not chain vaping, I get 6 or 7 days.
p23
aVBut is it just as efficient/natural if I were to just use a pod system? lol I wouldn't mind picking up a suorin air or icare for salt nic, but definitely would like to pick up a Nautilus 2 over a pod if a low watt, mtl tank can work just as well \U0001f914

p25
aVI reccomend the suorin air if you want a cheaper option. Pods are 7 bucks and juice is anywhere from 10 to 30. Great for nicotine fix, not so much clouds. Holds a really long charge after you charge it for about 30 min.
p26
aVSuorin Air is the name of it!
p27
aVYeah, suorin wont bring you as much clouds as you want. Its really good for getting your nicotine fix, though! Love it for that and its portability

aVJust got 30 ml of peppermint bark 50 mg Nic salt for the suorin air an 30 of a 15 mg peach. Haven't tried the mod yet. Just got it in today for when u really really need a cig. What is your opinion on the mod? Also this is my first shot with Nic salts how do you use them or do you use them?

aVIt's so expensive tho. I can get the suorin air or drop for 20-25 on eBay but the mipod is only in certain sites and it's like $50 bucks smh.

aVEither a juul or a sourin air. The air is nice cause you put your own juice in it and aren't stuck paying way more for packs of pods. Me salt e has great juice for the device as well.
p44
aVYes, I know the Suorin Air is Mouth to Lung and I\u2019m pretty sure the Aspire Breeze is a similar device, although I don\u2019t know much about it. \u000a\u000aI would assume both of them use Mic Salts instead of conventional e-liquid. All that means is it\u2019s got more nicotine and simulates a real cigarette better without sacrificing flavor.

aVNot everybody likes vaping at 15watts. I know I didn't when I first started vaping. I eventually went back to cigarettes. Only once I could vape at 80w+ was I satisfied with vaping. Vaping at higher wattage means more power is required, which means larger batteries, sometimes two or three of them.\u000a\u000a I would say most people on Reddit that vape have a device capable of 75w or more and maybe that's why you don't think that vaping has gone in the direction you prefer. But you're just plain wrong. \u000a\u000aNic salts are fairly new to the mainstream and allow those low watt devices to push a lot of nicotine at low power. Juul, sourin air, mi-one, sourin drop all take nic salts. And even if nicotine isn't your thing and that doesn't matter there are plenty of stealth mods that you could fit in the palm of your hand that aren't designed for nic salt.\u000a\u000aSo the reason you're getting downvoted is because you didn't bother to do any type of research before complaining.

p60
aVI do not have a Suorin but I have heard of people having leak issues and just issues in general if they use the V1 pods for the V2 or vice versa because they were not meant to be used for each other and people weren\u2019t sure how to tell if it was a V1 or V2 pod. \u000a\u000aI\u2019m not sure how to identify the difference between the V1 or V2 pods but I remember seeing a post a couple days ago where somebody explained how to tell the difference so if you maybe look around you may find the post?

aVWe sell a good bit of the sourin air models at our shop. Just remember to order salt mix. Regular ejuice isn't concentrated enough for such a small device.
p67
aVSuorin Air!
p68
aVWeird that they would make it 50/50 when you're "supposed" to use 70/30... I say "supposed" because that's what was explained to me and it's in the suorin/icare manual. 
p69
aVI had one and threw it out because it always bubbled and had spit back. Soon as I\u2019d clear it, within an hour it was spitting and getting nic salt in my mouth. For this type of setup, I like the Suorin Air or the ICare Mini with the added portable charging cradle. No spitback or bubbling with the Suorin and only a little right after filling the iCare mini. That charging cradle is great for many fills of the small tank and you can use it without the cradle if you need super stealth. 
p70
aVYeah because suorin has fixed wattage at 15w
p71
aVI have hit my friends suorin air. I personaly like it, but I want to know how you feel about it.
p72
aVGet a juul, sourin air, or sourin drop. Use nicotine salts. You will not want cigs anymore. 50mg. 
p73
aVWith the nicotine salts it\u2019s super smooth. I recommend either mr salte juice or solace juice in a suorin air. Both of those come in 35mg. It\u2019s the closest you will get to a cig. 
p74
aVSounds like pods are for you. Please **don't** get any Smok products. Though I have not used one, I would suggest Phix, Juul or Sourin Air. I'm sure the more experienced ones will chime in.
p75
aVNew sourin pods burning quickly?
p76
aVI agree. I have the Juul and the Suorin Air and that's what did it for me. They both use nic salts which much more resemble the hit off a cigarette and allow higher nic without being too harsh.\u000a\u000aStill use my regular mod but any time I get a BAD craving, I take a few rips off my juul or air and I'm good to go.

aVKinda stupid question. Can you use non nicsalt juice in a sourin air? They look nice and I'd love to stick some 6mg jam monster in there but I don't wanna have to go up to 25 or 50 nic juice just to use it
p81
aVYeah. You're consuming a regular dosage of an addictive substance. At least that's how I see it would likely work. \u000a\u000aAs always things with people and addictions sometimes are subjective to them personally and one may not feel as dependent as the other. One person may start to feel cravings and the dependency more than others in a given time frame or maybe in general. I'm not a doctor just speculating on what I've observed in myself and others. \u000a\u000aIt sounds like you're already feeling somewhat addicted with cravings, do you also get irritable when you have gone a given time without? The Sourin probably had a high nic level and depending on frequency of use you may be feeling it already. \u000a\u000aJust taper down to 0mg or cold turkey it and stick it out for a bit with 0mg if you want for health concerns or whatever reasons it may worry you. I mean it isn't the healthiest thing in the world to be on it anyways I suppose. \u000a\u000aI went from cigarettes to 3mg after 9 years of smoking at various frequencies (not quite a pack a day and lesser as I got older, sometimes not many at all a day, sometimes up to a pack if drinking) and haven't thought about cutting it out quite yet, but I've beat worse things in the past so I know I could endure it. \u000a\u000aEither way you likely will be somewhat dependent on it and since you're still young (not an insulting way), maybe tapering off and nipping it in the bud is better. Then again you're old enough to decide how you want to live. Either way hopefully you figure out what you want to do and maybe this was of some help.
p82
aVThat's what I figured, but in the blue ecig website it showed a diagram with like a 3 piece vape. Battery, atomizer/juice reservoir and mouthpiece. I'm assuming the sourin is close but I wasn't sure. We don't need more fucking names for things FDA \U0001f644

aVthey aren\u2019t lying. i watch them do it. i go in with my best friend to buy 50mg nic salt juice with him. i know for a fact that they chain vape 45-50 all day for a month or two and they can quit anytime they want because i\u2019ve seen friends of mine quit. they use juuls, juno\u2019s, suorin airs and aspire breezes if you\u2019d like to look up the device they use. 
p86
aVYou may not be truly allergic, but PG sensitivity is somewhat common. It also may be a flavor that you're using (for instance, some people are allergic to banana).\u000a\u000aAs someone else said, stay hydrated for sure. Unfortunately, with a system like the Suorin Air, you can't really up the VG or it won't wick properly. You could look into a sub-ohm setup that will let you use higher VG liquids, but that's up to you.\u000a\u000aWere you a smoker who switched, or did you just pick up vaping? For people who switch, there's a lot of unpleasant symptoms for the first month or so while your body flushes out the toxins from smoking. I had throat sores for about a month, just had to power through it. If you picked up vaping on its own, then your body may be acclimating to the new "thing."
p87
aVyes juul's are nic salt, suorin air is a very simple system as well you just turn it on and take a pull to hit the vape.

p92
aVI use 30 in my suorin. I use this when I\u2019m out and not hitting it nearly as much. 30 is my sweet spot. I tried a friends 50 and damn that shit hit way harder than a juul. So def under 45 for myself 
p93
aVup to you man, I enjoy the suorin and 30. 40 might be okay but you probably won\u2019t be hitting as much
p94
aVTry the Suorin Air. It pulls almost exactly like a cigarette, the only problem it looks nothing like a vape or cigarette. I gave one to my mom and it helped her cut back on smoking a lot. Now she'll smoke like 1 or 2 cigarettes a month (usually when she's out of juice)
p95
aVNah I ended up selling it it was just too much maintenance for me you know? I prefer just a simple juul or suorin where you don't have to replace coils, prime it etc.
p96
aVAre you using the "direct to lung" method to take hits or the "mouth to lung", like smoking a cig to hit your vape? I use 45mg Mr. Salt-E or 50mg Solace juices in a Suorin Air and the MTL method and I sometimes get light headed if I hit it too often and one time I got a few drops in my mouth and started feeling nauseous. Burning at 20w should be fine since most MTL devices burn about that as well, if you\u2019re not getting sick from too much nic then you should be fine if you\u2019re not chain vaping. Nic salts absorbs better than regular nic found in most juices. Which is why I use it for work where I can only take a 5 min break every hour or so. When home, I burn regular nic in my g-priv or t-priv but also using MTL tanks and I hit those with a restricted direct lung method and chain vape because of the lower nic content.

aVSuorin Questions Please help!!!!!!!!!!!!
p100
aVI just bought my first salt nic from level up vapor, mango flavor. It's pretty good, I'm not crazy about mango flavors but another poster sold me on it. I figured there was no sense in buying another mod for salt nic, especially something that uses cartridges. I like building and feel cartridges/subohms are for those who either can't build or can't be bothered with it. But I'll be honest, I still really want a suorin air or an iCare 2 for the form factor.
p101
aVIn a nutshell it uses crystallized nicotine instead of liquid nic. This allows for a smoother hit with a higher nic level. Generally the devices you use salt nic with are high ohm, low wattage and low air flow. However I build my Merlin mini with a 1.3ohm coil and I'm waiting for some salt nic from level up vapor. So we will see what happens. iCare and suorin are a couple mod makers for this. I tried it at a vape convention and it's pretty sweet. Not really for cloud chasing though. But, you get a nice lung hit and that nicotine high some people like. 24mg feels like 6-10 or so and 45mg-50mg feels like 24mg from what I've heard.
p102
aVsuorin air caused me oversalivation
p103
aVIf you want something with a tighter draw like a cigarette there are plenty of ultra portable kits out there like the Juul. All of my friends got Juuls but they're replacement pods are in high demand where I live so we moved over to the Suorin Air and I've been loving it! Easy to fill with just and extremely small
p104
aVI\u2019ve been using the Suorin Air and the MTL is great out of the box, no adjustments can be made.  I also use the iCare mini which is too loose for MTL but great for restricted. Both are great for stealth vaping at work.
p105
aVYou will want/need higher nic content if you\u2019ve been using a sub-ohm with 3mg, nic. The equivalent to 3mg nic would be 12 mg nic in your same everyday juice or 30 to 45mg nic salts, which absorbs much better and gives a very satisfying vape with the small amount of vapor you\u2019ll be producing. I\u2019ve been loving my Suorin Air and icare mini with nic salts from Mr Salt-E, I can take a 5 minute vape break at work and get the same satisfaction I use to get from a cig break and be good for an hour or two till the next break. It\u2019s also good for those high stress moments when you think you might really want a cig instead of vape.

My local vape shop still hasn't gotten it. I also tried the aspire breeze but it had too much airflow. 
p109
aVHave you had any issues with the suorin?
p110
aVAll these devices have some sort of issue. With the Suorin I felt that it was the most consistent device next to the Juul. I've been vaping subohm tanks and mods for close to 4 years now and lately I've been leaving my Mod at home when I go out. I'm confident that a full charge and a full tank in the suorin will last me the evening when going out.

aVI was a 3 pack a day smoker just over 4 months ago (smoked for 44 years) and I weened myself off the cigs by having one per hour and one after a meal for the first 2 weeks, vaping 12mg in between. By then end of the first week I noticed I was skipping my hourly smoke and going 2 and 3 hours without one. By the end of the second week I went most of the day without one and only had one after a meal. That's when I quit them all together and haven't had one since. I am a Mouth to lung vaper and I enjoy the "act" of vaping (smoking) and don't have plans to actually quit vaping. There has been a few stressful days I wish I had a cig but luckily I also carry a small icare mini and/or a Suorin Air filled with 45mg nic salts which sounds extremely high but it absorbs differently and gives a great throat hit and really helps for those extra stressful days and during work when you can only go out occasionally to have a break. But when I'm home, it's back to chain vaping the 12mg.
p115
aVfrom Vaping.com:\u000a\u000a&gt;The difference comes from using nicotine salts. "Nic salts" more closely resemble the feel of traditional cigarettes because of its quicker absorption into your bloodstream.\u000a\u000a&gt;These products are specifically meant to be used in pod-based, closed systems and low-output atomizers/mods. We recommend these liquids for use with the Vapor Shark Minnow, Eleaf iCare, Wismec MyJet, or Suorin Air for optimum performance. 
p116
aVSuorin Air, $20, replacement tanks/coil is $4 but can be refilled many times, no buttons, just suck. Use with Mr. Salt-E 45mg nic salts, so smooth,so stealthy and I'm on my second week with same pod. Or try the Vaporesso Aurora, looks and feels like a Zippo lighter, battery lasts 2 full tanks of juice and takes 1.5 hrs to charge. The Suorin takes about half the time to charge but you will be charging it twice in one tank of juice. Or try the ICare mini and get the Personal Charging Cradle (PCC) for about $25 or $30 and use the same juice with a slightly looser draw and the cradle is small enough to pocket and will give you a full day of battery and you'll fill the tank 5 or 6 times before needing a charge with the cradle, or a half tank of  juice per charge without the cradle. I have all three and love all three for stealth vaping at work. The nic salts satisfies lomg enough between smoke breaks while working. I can carry all three at the same time.

aVI was a 2 to 3 pack a day smoker for 44 years and I started with 12mg juice but I couldn't burn it in a baby beast because it was like razor blades on the throat. I got a Nautilus tank and burned at 15 to 18 watts with cigarette like draws (mouth to lung) and I've been cig free for over 4 months now. I admit I was chain vaping at that level but I was out of work so that contributed to the chain vaping. I recently got back to work and started using small low wattage devices like the Suorin Air, icare mini and Vaporesso Aurora with 45mg nic salts by Mr. Salt-E and these are fantastic for that one to two hours between smoke breaks, I'll hit these for like 5 mins and my nic level is good to go for the no vape time between breaks.
p118
aVNic salts is different than nic in diy juice and everyday premium vape juice, it absorbs quicker and is intended for MTL vapers, not your normal DL sub-ohm tanks. It gives the small amount of vapor a more equal nicotine hit comparable to a cigarette. It is not intended for chain vaping, unless you are a chain smoker to begin with. Many people, like myself, aren't necessarily trying to quit the "act of smoking". I just wanted to save money and get rid of the stink. I use the Suorin Air and Icare mini with Mr. Salt-E 45mg nic salt. These are low wattage devices similar to the JUUL. They are Mouth to lung devices that only produce the amount of vapor a cigarette would, roughly. I use these primarily for work where I can't chain vape my everyday mod. They are great for that 5 min cig break during the day because they give me the nicotine effects of a cig, and I can wait an hour or two till the next break. At home, I use a mod with a restricted lung hit or MTL RTA burning around 25watts and I use the everyday nicotine that you all use, but that juice is only 12mg. That nicotine doesn't absorb as well as the nic salts and is very harsh at higher wattages, which is one reason DL vapers who use tanks like the tfv12 or Crown III only use 3mg nic, these people get their nic hit in the giant amount of clouds they suck in. If I tried using Mr Salt-E in a tfv12 and took that much cloud in, I'd probably pass out and get nic poisoning. It is your responsibility as a vape store associate to educate your customers. These devices are ment for MTL vaping for those who don't want to give up the "act of smoking", yet want to quit the stink. They are for people who have smoked 44 years at 2 to 3 packs a day and may want to ween them selves off nicotine but starting with a JUUL or Suorin for better success, keeping the "habit" as normal as possible. I've been cig free for 4 months after 44 years of stinkies. I love the act, I hate the stink. My 45mg nic gives me the same satisfaction as a cig did with the same amount of vapor as a cig. When I want more clouds, I reduce the nic. What I do see and don't like is high school kids buying JUUL to get that 5 min head rush from the high nic content. This will lead to the 44 year habit I've had. There are better things to get high on but obviously you can't tell them that.  So find out what your customers are trying to achieve. A long time smoker trying to quit will have better luck with higher nic content. If they want the cig experience then suggest a mtl tank with regular juice and 12mg nic. If they want to quit and also want DL type clouds, recommend 3 to 6mg nic. If they need the occasional cig break satisfaction then the Suorin Air, Icare / icare Mini or Vaporesso Aurora are great with nic salts.
p119
aVI have been using the Sourin Air for while now  and i have been using 50mg salt based juice and idk if i am starting to become addicted to nicotine but i found myself using it more often and using up more juice idk if i should stop with the higher salt based nicotine juice's like 50 or if i will be some what okay if i keep using it.
p120
aVI have the Icare mini and to me, the MTL draw is too loose. I use it for a restricted direct lung hit more often than not. The Suorin Air has a great MTL draw and I burn 45mg Mr. Salt-E and it's very smooth with a great lung hit. Another great MTL aio is the Vaporesso Aurora and it has long lasting coils and larger battery, 650mAh compared to the Suorins 350ish mAh. I go through two tanks of juice per battery charge in the Aurora. The Suorin needs to be charged 4 times per tank of fluid but is much more comfortable to use than the Aurora but the coil doesn't last nearly as long. I'm on my second coil pod in a week on the Suorin and I'm on my 3rd coil in 4 months on the Aurora. I use these mostly for work where I only vape for 5 or 10 mins every hour or two and the nic salts covers me in between. My all day vapes are restricted lung hit rta's @ 22 watts and 12mg normal nic (for lack of a better term) and I chain vape these. 
p121
aVDang, thank ya kindly! Although, how does the icare battery compare them to the suorin?
p122
aVThe Icare mini battery by it self will last roughly a half to 3/4 tank of juice but with the personal charging cradle (pcc) it will last all day and 4 or 5 tank fills. The beauty of it is that it's small enough to keep in pocket or just keep the Icare in your pocket and place the pcc on your desk and put the mini in the cradle between breaks. If you place it in the cradle the wrong way, it won't charge and it will float in the cradle due to the magnets. I think by itself the battery is 360mAh and the cradle adds another 2300mah. The tank is small and DO NOT fill over the fill line because it will overflow and you'll have a mess. By it self it will last about as long as the Suorin, but again, the Suorin has a slightly larger tank but you have to always have a charging cable handy. I bring and two of the three to work and the Suorin is dead by noon and the mini or the Aurora will still be going on my drive home.

aVI have the iCare mini and just got the Suorin Air with Mr Salt-E Strawberry Funnel cake. The Suorin is a great MTL draw, about as good or even a little better than the Vaporesso Aurora, but it could stand to have a better battery. I love these little devices for work, the two will last me all day if I take a break every hour for 5 to 7 mins, about the average cig break and can even sneak a few hits in the bathroom for a Voop break.

aVHow long does a coil on the sourin usually last you?

aVThank you for posting this. I tried the suorin air at ECC Ontario(L.A.) and finally got to see what all the hype was with salt nic. I've also been trying to figure out what that mod was called for the past 2 weeks. I will say that salt nics are incredibly satisfying. I took like 3 or 4 drags and was very surprised on how great I felt. So perfect for discreet vaping and a quick break. My problem is that I like vaping, but over the last 4 or more years something has begun to go missing. Definitely going to buy one\u000a\u000aAlso, can anyone recommend some good salt nic juice? Thanks.
p127
aVIt's a higher concentration of a different kind of nicotine that absorbs better and gives a more satisfying throat hit and longer lasting effect but because of this, it's not for direct lung high wattage tanks. The small amount of vapor equal to cigs is all you need and lower wattage mouth to lung devices like the Suorin Air, My Jet, ICare Series are perfect for this. Mr Salt-E is a good juice and comes in 30 and 45mg nic strength and 6 to 8 hits and you're good to go till your next cig break. Not intended for chain vaping but rather cig breaks like you'd take at work. I love my Suorin and icare mini, the Suorin has a better MTL draw than the mini but I like a tight restricted direct lung hit from the mini too. Nic salts is much smoother than say 18mg of normal nic juice.

aVNic salt is made for those little aio pod type vape. I'm using 45mg Mr. Salt-E Strawberry Funnel cake in an ICare mini and a Suorin Air. It absorbs more/faster than regular nic so you only want 5 to 10 hits to get the equivalent nic of a cig, leaving you more satisfied and not meant for chain vaping. I use it for work where I can't chain vape, I take it outside for about 5 mins every hour and I'm good to go till the next hour or so. I use MTL tanks on my adv but only use 12 mg nic and need to constantly vape that with little break I between. Nic salt is no where near as harsh as say an 18 or 24mg of regular nic which to me is like swallowing razor blades, hence the 12mg regular nic.  NS gives a nice throat hit with little cig-like puffs and is why the JUUL is so popular.

aVi was a 9 years cancer stick sucker. decided to vape when cigarettes makes my heartbeat faster and chest feeling tight (during riding a bike, mostly), plus throat ache. i also downgraded from marlboro red, to less tar/nicotine cigs because of the harsher throat hit over the years. \u000a\u000aso i just celebrated my birthday 6 months ago, and i think i deserve to treat myself a birthday gift. a vape kit. coincidentally, i run out of cigarettes since morning when i bought my first vape kit on afternoon. it was a wismec rx mini kit, with root beer malaysian liquid. a low wattage mod, no nicotine / throat hit, but i like the flavor and more cloud than cigarettes. i like it so far. then i only smoke when the battery is charging. \u000a\u000awhen it broke after two weeks (damn you wismec) i'm back to smoke all day. but it already taste worse before i start vaping. so i decided to buy smoant battlestar with a limitless rdta atomizer borrowed from a friend. better flavor, better cloud. i was happy. much happier. turns out i like chucking huge dense cloud. that was amazing.\u000a\u000aand now vaping is my hobby. new mods, new atomizers, watching youtuber reviews, trying out coil builds, trying new juices, etc. now i can sleep better, wake up fresher, no more fast heartbeat, no more cancer sticks.\u000a\u000athe point is, you must quit smoking for your health. i admit, for the first 2 months i still LOVE the smell of tobacco when someone is smoking around me. but after that i just don't like it anymore. it's like smelling a pesticide and i don't want to smell it. last month i tried my friend's cigarette once. it's a marlboro menthol. it tastes so bitter, and i find it that vape has better throat/nicotine hit than that. i quit the cigarette halfway through. thank god.\u000a\u000ato OP: i'd suggest a mini/closed system mod. the way it feels much like a cigarette. then find a liquid with salt nicotine designed for closed system mod. i never try any mini mods before except suorin air with a salt nicotine liquid and i think that's pretty close to a cigarette.\u000a\u000aother suggestion is, buy a medium price range dual battery mod, a subohm tank if you don't want to bother installing coils and wicking, and a 9 or 12 mg nicotine liquid.  for me (and most of my friends) 6 mg nic USA liquids like Charlie Noble is way too strong, but to each and their own.
p141
aVYeah this is the first mod i've ever built in. and i bought the S/O the best starter kit my local store recommended. I previously used Pod systems such as the Juul and the Sourin Air but im having alot of fun with low-nic and good flavour juices in this first mod. \u000a\u000aSmall question, in the Serpent SMM are the included coils supposed to be such low ohms like .14?\u000a\u000aand Cheers.

aVThis is the one and only problem with the suorin, and it\u2019s a well known issue. It WILL leak onto the board, you WILL have to clean it, and it WILL happen again. Hopefully they fix the leaking issue on the next gen. A comparable product that\u2019s not too much larger is the suorin drop, and so far as I\u2019ve heard it doesn\u2019t leak like the air does . Hope that\u2019s helpful!

aVReceived my Aspire Nautilus AIO today (switched from Suorin Drop). Used the NS coil, filled with 50mg SaltNic, waited ten minutes, and it tastes like burnt plastic! Changed flavors, same nasty taste. Any idea why or how to resolve?
p152
aVI wouldn't recommend it. There are a bunch of MTL/Pod Systems now that are amazing. An affordable one that seems to be pretty reliable is the Minifit. There's also the Suorin Drop which I've heard is very good. \u000a\u000aI don't recommend Smok to anyone because in my experience, their coils are garbage. They have less flavor than a lot of other brands and it seems like you'll almost never buy a 5 pack where all 5 coils work well.
p153
aVok, i definitely liked my Suorin Air so i would for sure consider the Suorin Drop. i\u2019ll look into the minifit rn
p154
aVSuorin Drop won\u2019t hit! Brand new
p155
aVIf you plan on getting into the pod systems I would highly recommend the smok novo or the sourin drop. I've been through many pod systems and they are my two favorites that I've had. And for a juice with menthol that's not overpowering, a good line for that is aqua by marina vapes. They are really good fruity juices and the ice version don't have that overpowering menthol hit. Hope this helps and goodluck on your journey to quit cigs
p156
aVIts my first "salts" mail so i dont know what to expect yet but so far i think its better than a huge vape with huge clouds. I think i like the sourin drop more than my VooPoo Drag.

aVI switched from Juul to Sourin Air and I've been saving a ton. Being able to pick your own juice and nic strength is great and the pods last about 2-4 refills for me and I can usually get just over a week of life on them.
p158
aVHow many times can you refill a Novo Pod until it starts to burn? Just wondering since I'm switching from a Sourin Air.
p159
aVI usually chuck tits on a big sub-ohm, but I got this so I can take it around places without it being a hassle.\u000a\u000aI've had it only less than a week but I love it so far. The guy at the B&amp;M said these devices have been the most reliable as far as he's seen so far since it has a button fire instead of the usual drag fire.\u000a\u000aI've had a Suorin Air a few months back (which broke) and I can say that my first impression for this is a lot better. 
p160
aVI've been saying this since forever and nobody believes Me.\u000a\u000aThis is the most underrated device ever and cheap as balls.\u000a\u000aPeople are drooling over orions, juuls suorin and other crap while this cheap pod just keeps chugging and it's cheap too.

aVSince quitting cigarettes I've had Mouth To Lung devices. Old ones I can't even remember because they are off market. They mostly come from shenzen.. China. Great stuff but short lasting. \u000a\u000aMost recently:\u000aSuorin Air - 4 month lifespan\u000aSuorin Drop - 4 month lifespan\u000aSuorin Drop - 2 month lifespan\u000a\u000aAnd now I have the Smok NOVO. \u000aThe pod works way better than suorin pods. The battery lasts a good while ... I've only charged it when it stopped working.. 5 times, so it is new to me but I'm feeling positive.\u000a\u000aWith suorin products, the solder on the Android usb ALWAYS breaks and makes charging very difficult...
p162
aVTons of options out there. Let me suggest the lost vape Orion. It's a 'premuim' pod device typically around $75. But breazy vape has them for 39.99 right now. Still uses cartridges like the sourins, but the chip it has in it knows when your low on juice and will limit the voltage output to keep from burning or dry hitting. Therefore, prolonging the life of a single cartridge. \u000a\u000aNow another thing, if it's mainly for depression then I would look into CBD oil (honestly you don't even have to vape it, you can apply it in a few drops under your tongue) but if you want to vape it you can. You can put it in pods or regular box mods. CBD oil helps a variety of things such as, anxiety, depression, stress, fatigue, ect. \u000a\u000aHope this helps.

aVMy mom is a vape nazi she is convinced that it's going to ruin everything in her house if I vape anywhere near it she is one of those people that just doesn't understand that that's not how it works, so I got a little sourin air hoping it would make her or stop making my visit annoying, after all she's my mom and I love her, lol

aVGo hard and get yourself a vicious ant duke or an axis vapes m17 and for a tank a taifun gt3 or kayfun prime. On a more serious note it depends what you want. If you want something that feels like a cigarette sourin air and something bigger and badder if say no clue.

aVWell anything that has proprietary pods prefilled with juice will add up, cost wise, over time. The breeze, icare, and sourins all allow you to use your own juice for refilling which will greatly reduce your costs. I would also recommend checking out the mi-pod and mi-one which are great little devices. Refillable and relatively inexpensive with positive reviews. Element vape has both models priced at around 25 bucks right now which is a great deal. The mi-one takes a great many types of small aio coils so you would have no trouble finding them. \u000a\u000aGood luck!

aVYou're not really supposed to use salt nicotine e juice on a rda or other sub-ohm device. This is because usually too much power is running through it for high concentrations of nicotine and you need to be careful about overdoing it. Salt nicotine e juice are meant for devices like the sourin air, juno, juul, etc. You can find many of these devices in vape shops or online. The key difference between one of these devices and your rda is that the ohms (resistance) is much higher and the power is much power. This let's the device have a harder pull so it feels more similar to a cigarette. Useful for people trying to quit. I would not recommend using salt nicotine e juice on an rda, that just sounds like trouble if you ask me.

aVFor me, it helped out a lot more than a traditional ecig as far as quitting cigarettes. I was running a TFV12 Battlestar combo before and the vape was fantastic. Excellent flavor and vapor production; however, I felt I\u2019d have to sit and chain vape for far too long to get a buzz. With the Suorin tho, I can get a solid buzz from 1 or 2 puffs. It really just depends what you\u2019re looking for in your vape.\u000a\u000aTLDR: better for the buzz

Buttttttt I would strongly suggest getting a Smoant Charon and a Crown III tank. You will need to buy batteries and a battery charger tho (which may not be the route you wish to take at this early of a stage)\u000a\u000aI would suggest going to YouTube and searching \u201cAIO vape mod\u201d and starting from there.

aVNp. Head over to the sidebar of r/electronic_cigarette for more useful links. Most beginners are recommended with vape pens (all in ones) or pods (juul, suorin, etc) for starters. Try to avoid Smok products. Though some may have good experiences with them, a lot of threads with issues have been and still being posted. With their mass production comes with poor/unreliable quality. GL!

aVThe coil/cotton only lasts 5 or so fills before needing replacement. I use the Suorin Air, ICare Mini, Aspire Breeze and others and they all need new coils after about a week. Time is a bad measure because it\u2019s different for everyone and it\u2019s actual puffs that matter. The cotton in most coils will last about 2000 hits or so, give or take. When I was chain vaping, I was lucky to get three days off a coil. Now that I\u2019m not chain vaping, I get 6 or 7 days.

aVEither a juul or a sourin air. The air is nice cause you put your own juice in it and aren't stuck paying way more for packs of pods. Me salt e has great juice for the device as well.
p210
aVYes, I know the Suorin Air is Mouth to Lung and I\u2019m pretty sure the Aspire Breeze is a similar device, although I don\u2019t know much about it. \u000a\u000aI would assume both of them use Mic Salts instead of conventional e-liquid. All that means is it\u2019s got more nicotine and simulates a real cigarette better without sacrificing flavor.

aVNot everybody likes vaping at 15watts. I know I didn't when I first started vaping. I eventually went back to cigarettes. Only once I could vape at 80w+ was I satisfied with vaping. Vaping at higher wattage means more power is required, which means larger batteries, sometimes two or three of them.\u000a\u000a I would say most people on Reddit that vape have a device capable of 75w or more and maybe that's why you don't think that vaping has gone in the direction you prefer. But you're just plain wrong. \u000a\u000aNic salts are fairly new to the mainstream and allow those low watt devices to push a lot of nicotine at low power. Juul, sourin air, mi-one, sourin drop all take nic salts. And even if nicotine isn't your thing and that doesn't matter there are plenty of stealth mods that you could fit in the palm of your hand that aren't designed for nic salt.\u000a\u000aSo the reason you're getting downvoted is because you didn't bother to do any type of research before complaining.

aVI do not have a Suorin but I have heard of people having leak issues and just issues in general if they use the V1 pods for the V2 or vice versa because they were not meant to be used for each other and people weren\u2019t sure how to tell if it was a V1 or V2 pod. \u000a\u000aI\u2019m not sure how to identify the difference between the V1 or V2 pods but I remember seeing a post a couple days ago where somebody explained how to tell the difference so if you maybe look around you may find the post?

aVWeird that they would make it 50/50 when you're "supposed" to use 70/30... I say "supposed" because that's what was explained to me and it's in the suorin/icare manual. 
p235
aVI had one and threw it out because it always bubbled and had spit back. Soon as I\u2019d clear it, within an hour it was spitting and getting nic salt in my mouth. For this type of setup, I like the Suorin Air or the ICare Mini with the added portable charging cradle. No spitback or bubbling with the Suorin and only a little right after filling the iCare mini. That charging cradle is great for many fills of the small tank and you can use it without the cradle if you need super stealth. 
p236
aVYeah because suorin has fixed wattage at 15w
p237
aVI have hit my friends suorin air. I personaly like it, but I want to know how you feel about it.

aVGet a juul, sourin air, or sourin drop. Use nicotine salts. You will not want cigs anymore. 50mg. 
p239
aVWith the nicotine salts it\u2019s super smooth. I recommend either mr salte juice or solace juice in a suorin air. Both of those come in 35mg. It\u2019s the closest you will get to a cig. 
p240
aVSounds like pods are for you. Please **don't** get any Smok products. Though I have not used one, I would suggest Phix, Juul or Sourin Air. I'm sure the more experienced ones will chime in.
p241
aVNew sourin pods burning quickly?
p242
aVI agree. I have the Juul and the Suorin Air and that's what did it for me. They both use nic salts which much more resemble the hit off a cigarette and allow higher nic without being too harsh.\u000a\u000aStill use my regular mod but any time I get a BAD craving, I take a few rips off my juul or air and I'm good to go.

aVKinda stupid question. Can you use non nicsalt juice in a sourin air? They look nice and I'd love to stick some 6mg jam monster in there but I don't wanna have to go up to 25 or 50 nic juice just to use it
p247
aVYeah. You're consuming a regular dosage of an addictive substance. At least that's how I see it would likely work. \u000a\u000aAs always things with people and addictions sometimes are subjective to them personally and one may not feel as dependent as the other. One person may start to feel cravings and the dependency more than others in a given time frame or maybe in general. I'm not a doctor just speculating on what I've observed in myself and others. \u000a\u000aIt sounds like you're already feeling somewhat addicted with cravings, do you also get irritable when you have gone a given time without? The Sourin probably had a high nic level and depending on frequency of use you may be feeling it already. \u000a\u000aJust taper down to 0mg or cold turkey it and stick it out for a bit with 0mg if you want for health concerns or whatever reasons it may worry you. I mean it isn't the healthiest thing in the world to be on it anyways I suppose. \u000a\u000aI went from cigarettes to 3mg after 9 years of smoking at various frequencies (not quite a pack a day and lesser as I got older, sometimes not many at all a day, sometimes up to a pack if drinking) and haven't thought about cutting it out quite yet, but I've beat worse things in the past so I know I could endure it. \u000a\u000aEither way you likely will be somewhat dependent on it and since you're still young (not an insulting way), maybe tapering off and nipping it in the bud is better. Then again you're old enough to decide how you want to live. Either way hopefully you figure out what you want to do and maybe this was of some help.
p248
aVThat's what I figured, but in the blue ecig website it showed a diagram with like a 3 piece vape. Battery, atomizer/juice reservoir and mouthpiece. I'm assuming the sourin is close but I wasn't sure. We don't need more fucking names for things FDA \U0001f644

p252
aVYou may not be truly allergic, but PG sensitivity is somewhat common. It also may be a flavor that you're using (for instance, some people are allergic to banana).\u000a\u000aAs someone else said, stay hydrated for sure. Unfortunately, with a system like the Suorin Air, you can't really up the VG or it won't wick properly. You could look into a sub-ohm setup that will let you use higher VG liquids, but that's up to you.\u000a\u000aWere you a smoker who switched, or did you just pick up vaping? For people who switch, there's a lot of unpleasant symptoms for the first month or so while your body flushes out the toxins from smoking. I had throat sores for about a month, just had to power through it. If you picked up vaping on its own, then your body may be acclimating to the new "thing."
p253
aVyes juul's are nic salt, suorin air is a very simple system as well you just turn it on and take a pull to hit the vape.

aVI use 30 in my suorin. I use this when I\u2019m out and not hitting it nearly as much. 30 is my sweet spot. I tried a friends 50 and damn that shit hit way harder than a juul. So def under 45 for myself 
p259
aVup to you man, I enjoy the suorin and 30. 40 might be okay but you probably won\u2019t be hitting as much
p260
aVTry the Suorin Air. It pulls almost exactly like a cigarette, the only problem it looks nothing like a vape or cigarette. I gave one to my mom and it helped her cut back on smoking a lot. Now she'll smoke like 1 or 2 cigarettes a month (usually when she's out of juice)
p261
aVNah I ended up selling it it was just too much maintenance for me you know? I prefer just a simple juul or suorin where you don't have to replace coils, prime it etc.
p262
aVAre you using the "direct to lung" method to take hits or the "mouth to lung", like smoking a cig to hit your vape? I use 45mg Mr. Salt-E or 50mg Solace juices in a Suorin Air and the MTL method and I sometimes get light headed if I hit it too often and one time I got a few drops in my mouth and started feeling nauseous. Burning at 20w should be fine since most MTL devices burn about that as well, if you\u2019re not getting sick from too much nic then you should be fine if you\u2019re not chain vaping. Nic salts absorbs better than regular nic found in most juices. Which is why I use it for work where I can only take a 5 min break every hour or so. When home, I burn regular nic in my g-priv or t-priv but also using MTL tanks and I hit those with a restricted direct lung method and chain vape because of the lower nic content.

aVI just bought my first salt nic from level up vapor, mango flavor. It's pretty good, I'm not crazy about mango flavors but another poster sold me on it. I figured there was no sense in buying another mod for salt nic, especially something that uses cartridges. I like building and feel cartridges/subohms are for those who either can't build or can't be bothered with it. But I'll be honest, I still really want a suorin air or an iCare 2 for the form factor.
p267
aVIn a nutshell it uses crystallized nicotine instead of liquid nic. This allows for a smoother hit with a higher nic level. Generally the devices you use salt nic with are high ohm, low wattage and low air flow. However I build my Merlin mini with a 1.3ohm coil and I'm waiting for some salt nic from level up vapor. So we will see what happens. iCare and suorin are a couple mod makers for this. I tried it at a vape convention and it's pretty sweet. Not really for cloud chasing though. But, you get a nice lung hit and that nicotine high some people like. 24mg feels like 6-10 or so and 45mg-50mg feels like 24mg from what I've heard.
p268
aVsuorin air caused me oversalivation
p269
aVIf you want something with a tighter draw like a cigarette there are plenty of ultra portable kits out there like the Juul. All of my friends got Juuls but they're replacement pods are in high demand where I live so we moved over to the Suorin Air and I've been loving it! Easy to fill with just and extremely small
p270
aVI\u2019ve been using the Suorin Air and the MTL is great out of the box, no adjustments can be made.  I also use the iCare mini which is too loose for MTL but great for restricted. Both are great for stealth vaping at work.
p271
aVYou will want/need higher nic content if you\u2019ve been using a sub-ohm with 3mg, nic. The equivalent to 3mg nic would be 12 mg nic in your same everyday juice or 30 to 45mg nic salts, which absorbs much better and gives a very satisfying vape with the small amount of vapor you\u2019ll be producing. I\u2019ve been loving my Suorin Air and icare mini with nic salts from Mr Salt-E, I can take a 5 minute vape break at work and get the same satisfaction I use to get from a cig break and be good for an hour or two till the next break. It\u2019s also good for those high stress moments when you think you might really want a cig instead of vape.

I've been vaping subohm tanks and mods for close to 4 years now and lately I've been leaving my Mod at home when I go out. I'm confident that a full charge and a full tank in the suorin will last me the evening when going out.

aVI was a 3 pack a day smoker just over 4 months ago (smoked for 44 years) and I weened myself off the cigs by having one per hour and one after a meal for the first 2 weeks, vaping 12mg in between. By then end of the first week I noticed I was skipping my hourly smoke and going 2 and 3 hours without one. By the end of the second week I went most of the day without one and only had one after a meal. That's when I quit them all together and haven't had one since. I am a Mouth to lung vaper and I enjoy the "act" of vaping (smoking) and don't have plans to actually quit vaping. There has been a few stressful days I wish I had a cig but luckily I also carry a small icare mini and/or a Suorin Air filled with 45mg nic salts which sounds extremely high but it absorbs differently and gives a great throat hit and really helps for those extra stressful days and during work when you can only go out occasionally to have a break. But when I'm home, it's back to chain vaping the 12mg.
p281
aVfrom Vaping.com:\u000a\u000a&gt;The difference comes from using nicotine salts. "Nic salts" more closely resemble the feel of traditional cigarettes because of its quicker absorption into your bloodstream.\u000a\u000a&gt;These products are specifically meant to be used in pod-based, closed systems and low-output atomizers/mods. We recommend these liquids for use with the Vapor Shark Minnow, Eleaf iCare, Wismec MyJet, or Suorin Air for optimum performance. 
p282
aVSuorin Air, $20, replacement tanks/coil is $4 but can be refilled many times, no buttons, just suck. Use with Mr. Salt-E 45mg nic salts, so smooth,so stealthy and I'm on my second week with same pod. Or try the Vaporesso Aurora, looks and feels like a Zippo lighter, battery lasts 2 full tanks of juice and takes 1.5 hrs to charge. The Suorin takes about half the time to charge but you will be charging it twice in one tank of juice. Or try the ICare mini and get the Personal Charging Cradle (PCC) for about $25 or $30 and use the same juice with a slightly looser draw and the cradle is small enough to pocket and will give you a full day of battery and you'll fill the tank 5 or 6 times before needing a charge with the cradle, or a half tank of  juice per charge without the cradle. I have all three and love all three for stealth vaping at work. The nic salts satisfies lomg enough between smoke breaks while working. I can carry all three at the same time.
p283
aVI was a 2 to 3 pack a day smoker for 44 years and I started with 12mg juice but I couldn't burn it in a baby beast because it was like razor blades on the throat. I got a Nautilus tank and burned at 15 to 18 watts with cigarette like draws (mouth to lung) and I've been cig free for over 4 months now. I admit I was chain vaping at that level but I was out of work so that contributed to the chain vaping. I recently got back to work and started using small low wattage devices like the Suorin Air, icare mini and Vaporesso Aurora with 45mg nic salts by Mr. Salt-E and these are fantastic for that one to two hours between smoke breaks, I'll hit these for like 5 mins and my nic level is good to go for the no vape time between breaks.
p284
aVNic salts is different than nic in diy juice and everyday premium vape juice, it absorbs quicker and is intended for MTL vapers, not your normal DL sub-ohm tanks. It gives the small amount of vapor a more equal nicotine hit comparable to a cigarette. It is not intended for chain vaping, unless you are a chain smoker to begin with. Many people, like myself, aren't necessarily trying to quit the "act of smoking". I just wanted to save money and get rid of the stink. I use the Suorin Air and Icare mini with Mr. Salt-E 45mg nic salt. These are low wattage devices similar to the JUUL. They are Mouth to lung devices that only produce the amount of vapor a cigarette would, roughly. I use these primarily for work where I can't chain vape my everyday mod. They are great for that 5 min cig break during the day because they give me the nicotine effects of a cig, and I can wait an hour or two till the next break. At home, I use a mod with a restricted lung hit or MTL RTA burning around 25watts and I use the everyday nicotine that you all use, but that juice is only 12mg. That nicotine doesn't absorb as well as the nic salts and is very harsh at higher wattages, which is one reason DL vapers who use tanks like the tfv12 or Crown III only use 3mg nic, these people get their nic hit in the giant amount of clouds they suck in. If I tried using Mr Salt-E in a tfv12 and took that much cloud in, I'd probably pass out and get nic poisoning. It is your responsibility as a vape store associate to educate your customers. These devices are ment for MTL vaping for those who don't want to give up the "act of smoking", yet want to quit the stink. They are for people who have smoked 44 years at 2 to 3 packs a day and may want to ween them selves off nicotine but starting with a JUUL or Suorin for better success, keeping the "habit" as normal as possible. I've been cig free for 4 months after 44 years of stinkies. I love the act, I hate the stink. My 45mg nic gives me the same satisfaction as a cig did with the same amount of vapor as a cig. When I want more clouds, I reduce the nic. What I do see and don't like is high school kids buying JUUL to get that 5 min head rush from the high nic content. This will lead to the 44 year habit I've had. There are better things to get high on but obviously you can't tell them that.  So find out what your customers are trying to achieve. A long time smoker trying to quit will have better luck with higher nic content. If they want the cig experience then suggest a mtl tank with regular juice and 12mg nic. If they want to quit and also want DL type clouds, recommend 3 to 6mg nic. If they need the occasional cig break satisfaction then the Suorin Air, Icare / icare Mini or Vaporesso Aurora are great with nic salts.
p285
aVI have been using the Sourin Air for while now  and i have been using 50mg salt based juice and idk if i am starting to become addicted to nicotine but i found myself using it more often and using up more juice idk if i should stop with the higher salt based nicotine juice's like 50 or if i will be some what okay if i keep using it.
p286
aVI have the Icare mini and to me, the MTL draw is too loose. I use it for a restricted direct lung hit more often than not. The Suorin Air has a great MTL draw and I burn 45mg Mr. Salt-E and it's very smooth with a great lung hit. Another great MTL aio is the Vaporesso Aurora and it has long lasting coils and larger battery, 650mAh compared to the Suorins 350ish mAh. I go through two tanks of juice per battery charge in the Aurora. The Suorin needs to be charged 4 times per tank of fluid but is much more comfortable to use than the Aurora but the coil doesn't last nearly as long. I'm on my second coil pod in a week on the Suorin and I'm on my 3rd coil in 4 months on the Aurora. I use these mostly for work where I only vape for 5 or 10 mins every hour or two and the nic salts covers me in between. My all day vapes are restricted lung hit rta's @ 22 watts and 12mg normal nic (for lack of a better term) and I chain vape these. 
p287
aVDang, thank ya kindly! Although, how does the icare battery compare them to the suorin?
p288
aVThe Icare mini battery by it self will last roughly a half to 3/4 tank of juice but with the personal charging cradle (pcc) it will last all day and 4 or 5 tank fills. The beauty of it is that it's small enough to keep in pocket or just keep the Icare in your pocket and place the pcc on your desk and put the mini in the cradle between breaks. If you place it in the cradle the wrong way, it won't charge and it will float in the cradle due to the magnets. I think by itself the battery is 360mAh and the cradle adds another 2300mah. The tank is small and DO NOT fill over the fill line because it will overflow and you'll have a mess. By it self it will last about as long as the Suorin, but again, the Suorin has a slightly larger tank but you have to always have a charging cable handy. I bring and two of the three to work and the Suorin is dead by noon and the mini or the Aurora will still be going on my drive home.

aVI have the iCare mini and just got the Suorin Air with Mr Salt-E Strawberry Funnel cake. The Suorin is a great MTL draw, about as good or even a little better than the Vaporesso Aurora, but it could stand to have a better battery. I love these little devices for work, the two will last me all day if I take a break every hour for 5 to 7 mins, about the average cig break and can even sneak a few hits in the bathroom for a Voop break.

p292
aVThank you for posting this. I tried the suorin air at ECC Ontario(L.A.) and finally got to see what all the hype was with salt nic. I've also been trying to figure out what that mod was called for the past 2 weeks. I will say that salt nics are incredibly satisfying. I took like 3 or 4 drags and was very surprised on how great I felt. So perfect for discreet vaping and a quick break. My problem is that I like vaping, but over the last 4 or more years something has begun to go missing. Definitely going to buy one\u000a\u000aAlso, can anyone recommend some good salt nic juice? Thanks.
p293
aVIt's a higher concentration of a different kind of nicotine that absorbs better and gives a more satisfying throat hit and longer lasting effect but because of this, it's not for direct lung high wattage tanks. The small amount of vapor equal to cigs is all you need and lower wattage mouth to lung devices like the Suorin Air, My Jet, ICare Series are perfect for this. Mr Salt-E is a good juice and comes in 30 and 45mg nic strength and 6 to 8 hits and you're good to go till your next cig break. Not intended for chain vaping but rather cig breaks like you'd take at work. I love my Suorin and icare mini, the Suorin has a better MTL draw than the mini but I like a tight restricted direct lung hit from the mini too. Nic salts is much smoother than say 18mg of normal nic juice.

aVNic salt is made for those little aio pod type vape. I'm using 45mg Mr. Salt-E Strawberry Funnel cake in an ICare mini and a Suorin Air. It absorbs more/faster than regular nic so you only want 5 to 10 hits to get the equivalent nic of a cig, leaving you more satisfied and not meant for chain vaping. I use it for work where I can't chain vape, I take it outside for about 5 mins every hour and I'm good to go till the next hour or so. I use MTL tanks on my adv but only use 12 mg nic and need to constantly vape that with little break I between. Nic salt is no where near as harsh as say an 18 or 24mg of regular nic which to me is like swallowing razor blades, hence the 12mg regular nic.  NS gives a nice throat hit with little cig-like puffs and is why the JUUL is so popular.

aVamerica, texas specifically. idk if it's just my town but in the bathroom at school today i saw 2 juuls, 3 suorin airs and about 5 or 6 junos. 
p297
aVIts the sourin air. Little thing packs a punch 
p298
aVI use the Rofvape Peas.  I really like it and the pods are cheap.  My US store for the pods is currently out so I just placed a big order from China. For the price I'll make due though.\u000a\u000aI've heard really good things about the Suorin air and the Boulder Rock.  Either would probably be a good choice.  The Suorin Drop just came out too.

aVSuorin air
p300
aVJust looked it up and it does look intriguing. I also ran into the Suorin Air which seems similar. Have experience with this unit? 
p301
aVI'm looking at vaperesso aurora or the Suorin Air. Granted these are very MTL stealth vapes so you may want a bit higher nicotine than you'd think. 
p302
aVI've been eyeing up the Suorin Air for this type of thing. 
p303
aVi'd suggest closed system pods like envii fit, suorin air, mi one, etc. the way it feels and the cloud size is more like a cig
p304
aVI've had a Suorin air for about 2 weeks now and it's leaking hardcore out of the base, any way to fix?

aVi was a 9 years cancer stick sucker. decided to vape when cigarettes makes my heartbeat faster and chest feeling tight (during riding a bike, mostly), plus throat ache. i also downgraded from marlboro red, to less tar/nicotine cigs because of the harsher throat hit over the years. \u000a\u000aso i just celebrated my birthday 6 months ago, and i think i deserve to treat myself a birthday gift. a vape kit. coincidentally, i run out of cigarettes since morning when i bought my first vape kit on afternoon. it was a wismec rx mini kit, with root beer malaysian liquid. a low wattage mod, no nicotine / throat hit, but i like the flavor and more cloud than cigarettes. i like it so far. then i only smoke when the battery is charging. \u000a\u000awhen it broke after two weeks (damn you wismec) i'm back to smoke all day. but it already taste worse before i start vaping. so i decided to buy smoant battlestar with a limitless rdta atomizer borrowed from a friend. better flavor, better cloud. i was happy. much happier. turns out i like chucking huge dense cloud. that was amazing.\u000a\u000aand now vaping is my hobby. new mods, new atomizers, watching youtuber reviews, trying out coil builds, trying new juices, etc. now i can sleep better, wake up fresher, no more fast heartbeat, no more cancer sticks.\u000a\u000athe point is, you must quit smoking for your health. i admit, for the first 2 months i still LOVE the smell of tobacco when someone is smoking around me. but after that i just don't like it anymore. it's like smelling a pesticide and i don't want to smell it. last month i tried my friend's cigarette once. it's a marlboro menthol. it tastes so bitter, and i find it that vape has better throat/nicotine hit than that. i quit the cigarette halfway through. thank god.\u000a\u000ato OP: i'd suggest a mini/closed system mod. the way it feels much like a cigarette. then find a liquid with salt nicotine designed for closed system mod. i never try any mini mods before except suorin air with a salt nicotine liquid and i think that's pretty close to a cigarette.\u000a\u000aother suggestion is, buy a medium price range dual battery mod, a subohm tank if you don't want to bother installing coils and wicking, and a 9 or 12 mg nicotine liquid.  for me (and most of my friends) 6 mg nic USA liquids like Charlie Noble is way too strong, but to each and their own.
p307
aVYeah this is the first mod i've ever built in. and i bought the S/O the best starter kit my local store recommended. I previously used Pod systems such as the Juul and the Sourin Air but im having alot of fun with low-nic and good flavour juices in this first mod. \u000a\u000aSmall question, in the Serpent SMM are the included coils supposed to be such low ohms like .14?\u000a\u000aand Cheers. 
p308
aVMini mods have been making a huge impact on the market lately. Some of the hottest ones we know are Juul, Phix, and suorin air! What are some other mini mods that we need to look out for !? \U0001f32c

aV\u000aSuorin Air is the typical design of most devices in vaping technology, the Suorin Air requires a double take at first glance. Featuring a compact design and slender composition, the Suorin Air offers convenience to a whole new level. No longer do users have to worry about a bulky unit taking up space in pockets or purses.

aVIm a newbie and have only tried ones like juul, sourin drop and vagon, and the SMOK badge. Do you use salt nics or eJuice? I\u2019ve only tried the salts, but like the variety of flavors available in eJuice. I\u2019m really trying to quit smoking cigs and have read people saying that the box mods are the best way to do that. I am leary of the complexity of coils and cotton and the lingo left me confused. I have been doing research and this sub reddit on vaping had been helping me!! I\u2019m actually becoming addicted to this page! Thanks

aVSuorin Air Over(?)firing
p316
aVThis is the one and only problem with the suorin, and it\u2019s a well known issue. It WILL leak onto the board, you WILL have to clean it, and it WILL happen again. Hopefully they fix the leaking issue on the next gen. A comparable product that\u2019s not too much larger is the suorin drop, and so far as I\u2019ve heard it doesn\u2019t leak like the air does . Hope that\u2019s helpful!

aVReceived my Aspire Nautilus AIO today (switched from Suorin Drop). Used the NS coil, filled with 50mg SaltNic, waited ten minutes, and it tastes like burnt plastic! Changed flavors, same nasty taste. Any idea why or how to resolve?
p318
aVI wouldn't recommend it. There are a bunch of MTL/Pod Systems now that are amazing. An affordable one that seems to be pretty reliable is the Minifit. There's also the Suorin Drop which I've heard is very good. \u000a\u000aI don't recommend Smok to anyone because in my experience, their coils are garbage. They have less flavor than a lot of other brands and it seems like you'll almost never buy a 5 pack where all 5 coils work well.
p319
aVok, i definitely liked my Suorin Air so i would for sure consider the Suorin Drop. i\u2019ll look into the minifit rn
p320
aVSuorin Drop won\u2019t hit! Brand new
p321
aVIf you plan on getting into the pod systems I would highly recommend the smok novo or the sourin drop. I've been through many pod systems and they are my two favorites that I've had. And for a juice with menthol that's not overpowering, a good line for that is aqua by marina vapes. They are really good fruity juices and the ice version don't have that overpowering menthol hit. Hope this helps and goodluck on your journey to quit cigs
p322
aVIts my first "salts" mail so i dont know what to expect yet but so far i think its better than a huge vape with huge clouds. I think i like the sourin drop more than my VooPoo Drag. 
p323
aVI switched from Juul to Sourin Air and I've been saving a ton. Being able to pick your own juice and nic strength is great and the pods last about 2-4 refills for me and I can usually get just over a week of life on them.
p324
aVHow many times can you refill a Novo Pod until it starts to burn? Just wondering since I'm switching from a Sourin Air.
p325
aVI usually chuck tits on a big sub-ohm, but I got this so I can take it around places without it being a hassle.\u000a\u000aI've had it only less than a week but I love it so far. The guy at the B&amp;M said these devices have been the most reliable as far as he's seen so far since it has a button fire instead of the usual drag fire.\u000a\u000aI've had a Suorin Air a few months back (which broke) and I can say that my first impression for this is a lot better. 
p326
aVI've been saying this since forever and nobody believes Me.\u000a\u000aThis is the most underrated device ever and cheap as balls.\u000a\u000aPeople are drooling over orions, juuls suorin and other crap while this cheap pod just keeps chugging and it's cheap too.
p327
aVSince quitting cigarettes I've had Mouth To Lung devices. Old ones I can't even remember because they are off market. They mostly come from shenzen.. China. Great stuff but short lasting. \u000a\u000aMost recently:\u000aSuorin Air - 4 month lifespan\u000aSuorin Drop - 4 month lifespan\u000aSuorin Drop - 2 month lifespan\u000a\u000aAnd now I have the Smok NOVO. \u000aThe pod works way better than suorin pods. The battery lasts a good while ... I've only charged it when it stopped working.. 5 times, so it is new to me but I'm feeling positive.\u000a\u000aWith suorin products, the solder on the Android usb ALWAYS breaks and makes charging very difficult...
p328
aVTons of options out there. Let me suggest the lost vape Orion. It's a 'premuim' pod device typically around $75. But breazy vape has them for 39.99 right now. Still uses cartridges like the sourins, but the chip it has in it knows when your low on juice and will limit the voltage output to keep from burning or dry hitting. Therefore, prolonging the life of a single cartridge. \u000a\u000aNow another thing, if it's mainly for depression then I would look into CBD oil (honestly you don't even have to vape it, you can apply it in a few drops under your tongue) but if you want to vape it you can. You can put it in pods or regular box mods. CBD oil helps a variety of things such as, anxiety, depression, stress, fatigue, ect. \u000a\u000aHope this helps. 
p329
aVMy mom is a vape nazi she is convinced that it's going to ruin everything in her house if I vape anywhere near it she is one of those people that just doesn't understand that that's not how it works, so I got a little sourin air hoping it would make her or stop making my visit annoying, after all she's my mom and I love her, lol

aVNew Suorin Vagon Not Working??
p331
aVI looked it up and the LD50 is 0 5-1mg/kg in humans(it's 50mg/kg in rats, which is just a bit higher lol)\u000a\u000aSo that would mean 15% of my suorin pod in one sitting would kill me. So I guess I'll have to be careful since I've definitely gone through that much before.\u000a\u000aI don't think I'd be a problem though since I would definitely be extremely dizzy way before then.
