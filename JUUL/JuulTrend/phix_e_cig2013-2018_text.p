VDoes Chain Vaping burn out pods? (pod mods)\u000a\u000aHey guys,\u000a\u000aI've searched as much as I can and tried to read through all the resources. This is pretty much my last plea in order to figure something out for my current smoking set up...\u000a\u000aI've messed around with different juices with different PG/VG ratios, pulled on the cartridges while blocking the air intake, and even filled pods and left them overnight.\u000a\u000aI've come to the unfortunate conclusion that it may just be simply my vaping etiquette that's been causing my pods to burn out. \u000a\u000aCan anyone with experience with pod mods please give some insight on this issue? Is this why the rest of y'all are on Rebuildable Atomizers? Is this how it's going to be when looking for a Juul/Phix replacement? \u000a\u000aI'm awaiting a shipment on a couple more devices that will hopefully solve my issue (Kimsun being temperature controlled), but I just find it very unbelievable that everyone seems to be content with their pod mods while I am here trying out 4-5 new cartridges only to find inconsistent and bad results. \u000a\u000aI'd really appreciate some answers! I know this subreddit gets a lot of troubleshooting questions but I'd really like someone with experience to just science the shit out of me!

aVVape pen styles for salt juice\u000a\u000aHi, I'm looking at all in one pod systems like the warlock pea/ phix and they look tacky. \u000a\u000aI'm wondering would something like the innoken endura t20 but something smaller slimmer for salt liquid?
p2
aVI tried a free one a year or so ago, among the worst juices I ever tasted was their rendition of tobacco. You hear the phrase licking an ashtray used before, this literally tasted like what I imagine it would be like. Even if it tasted good, it was still a shitty device. Basically a joye 510 (we're going back in time now) with a few changes and proprietary cartridges or whatever the hell you'd call them. It's old technology, that gives you a terrible experience overall. \u000a\u000aLike most big tobacco owned e-cigs (Mark Ten, Blu) they're I assume, still outdated, terrible flavor options, over priced, and almost pointless to use versus a pod system (Juul, Phix, Bo, Myjet, Dolphin, Penguin, the list goes on).
p3
aVI feel like it's become an epidemic. I go to a public school in a good neighborhood and you can find somebody vaping in every bathroom of the school during the passing periods. I've heard schools in lower end neighborhoods have it worse, but I've heard about the same things happening at private schools as well. During finals week there were 15 kids in one bathroom just vaping and hanging out. The school sends out emails about vaping every week. Seems like everyone at the school bought a juul or a phix because they thought it was cool and then got addicted to nicotine.
p4
aVPhix cant take multiple or long hits\u000a\u000aso i bought a phix off a guy for cheap since it was kinda broken but he said he almost fully fixed it. So basically the phix can take like one 7ish second hit and then it's light fades out and doesnt allow you to hit any longer. and then if you try to take another hit it doesnt work, and for it to let u take another 7 second hit it you have to wait 30 seconds.\u000a\u000aso if i take two 3.5 second hits it'll work, but no longer than that without waiting 30 seconds.
p5
aVLooks like the phix is in, your Phix wasn\u2019t really phixed.
p6
aVRemember That Everyone On This god forsaken forum hates anyone who wants to ask them instead of googling it themselves. If you're looking for an amazing cigalike look at the phix by mlv, the juul from pax labs, or the warlock p2 by rof. Good luck with the karma my guy!!
p7
aVThe Juul and Phix are well regarded in this current day and age. Neither are technically refillable, I know it's possible on the Juul, I haven't tried. \u000a\u000aThe pods could be cheaper that's for sure, but the great warranty they offer is why I chose it as my first pod system. I'm still researching refillable pod systems that are as close to the Juul as I can get in terms of size, weight and if possible customer service, so I can't really speak much on those. \u000a\u000a
p8
aVMi-pod is very loose draw, so it might be effective in achieving the cig feel. I\u2019d recommend something like the Juul or Phix personally. The SMPO kit has the closest throat hit to a cig and the nic hits you like a truck.  I\u2019d definitely get a small cigalike with nic salts to help you quit cigs.

aVGreat, an opportunity to hop on my alt account and talk shit.\u000a\u000aJuul/Ploom is one of the oddest birds i've encountered. I was at the Miami show a month before they launched and tested them out and put in a small pre-order. I've had them at all locations since launch and they've been nothing short of a nightmare of a company to work with. They routinely take months to fill orders and have never, ever caught up to the demand. Sure, its cool you have a hot product and all, but they've seemingly done nothing to support their retailers. Its rumored they do this on purpose to drive people to their site for orders, but even on the site they have delays and backorders. If you don't want to sell them in shops and want to just sell online, JUST TELL ME SO. I'm perpetually stuck in a spot where I can't tell them to "fuck off" because customers are beating down my door looking for pods. I don't know what they put in those pods, but Juul customers are like rabid lemmings looking for their fix, so i'm forced to keep stocking it. I just have to put in a $30k order and hope that they'll show up in under 3 months.\u000a\u000aI was glad that Phix and Von Erl converted a few of those customers, but still the demand is high. As a company with so much rolling in, I find it astounding that they need to do a round of fundraising to finance whatever they're doing. \u000a\u000aHere's an idea Juul: If you need to raise money, how about selling some fucking product? You've got endless PO's but you can't get your supply chain together after a year? \u000a\u000aI'm well aware that i'm the odd man out when it comes to financial and investment strategy. The correct thing to do is ignore your fundamental business and make up a bunch of fluffy optimistic numbers and get a bunch of VC whales to bankroll whatever hair-brained project you shat out. Then, you funnel out funds into bonuses and salaries until the money dries up and you do it all over again. Maybe i'm reaching here - - i'm reaching.\u000a\u000aAnyway, i'm jealous of Juul, that they can make a product so hot it doesn't matter if they fulfill it because people will line up and wait until they're goddamn good and ready to put it out. I wish I had that kind of product. Until then, i'll begrudgingly fork over cash and wait like a good little bitch for them to send me product.
p11
aVI was waiting for someone to jab me on this.\u000a\u000aVaping on a plane is definitely a bad idea. Not only does it make vaping look worse than it already is (can it get worse?) but it can also ding your wallet. IIRC, its a $2500 fine if they catch you.\u000a\u000aHowever, I take heavy precautions when I do it. When I see a lot of people vaping in places they shouldn't, they make **no effort** to conceal the vape. They exhale normally as if they aren't capable of holding it in and exhaling slowly, or they simple don't care and are authentic douche nozzles. \u000a\u000aWhen I vape at 30,000 feet, I take great care and preparation to position myself for full concealment. I put my sunglasses on and envelop myself in a cocoon using the provided $0.25 fleece blanket. I then nod to the side as if i'm asleep. Little do they know i'm actually awake (haha!) and preparing to strike. I've already secured the Von Erl / Phix / Juul in my hand deep inside the cocoon I ready it for action. I wait for the precise moment that the stewardess is walking away from me into the galley and bring it to my mouth, drag, and hold. The hold is the important part and where most people fail. You don't need to exhale like you normally would. The exhaust is what gets  you caught, and you need to hold that in. Finally, engage in a series of short exhaust puffs **through the nose**. This is key. Between these pulses, you inhale 30% more than you exhaled. This seems to reduce the amount of vapor until it's virtually nothing. Additionally, you want to keep your window closed. Light rays will show the vapor and get you nicked. In a pinch, you can also use the aforementioned $0.25 fleece blanket to exhale into and reduce the vapor further.\u000a\u000aIn closing, I know plane vaping is wrong, but with the effort I put into concealment I am certain nobody is aware of what i'm doing and i'm not contributing to the negative perception of vaping. 
p12
aVVery similar experience here as well. I\u2019ve been Vaping for 5 years and have started used everything from cigalikes to high end mech mods and attys. I was also weaning off it getting a bit tired of the hobby (time consuming and $$$$) and the Juul got me hooked instantly. It reminded me of why I started vaping and the ease of use and quick portable nic fix keeps me using it. \u000a\u000aI\u2019ve since used a handful of similar systems but they all fall a bit short in some way. I recently got to try a phix last week and it may very well be the closest thing to a Juul if not on par with it. The downside to me is the device is considerably bigger and the pods require tools to pull apart. I love that it uses magnetic pods since the Juul pods become loose over time. I really wish someone combine the 2 devices and created one with easy to refill pods. The Juul pods last me about 4 refills so that helps even out the costs. Even if they were cheaper however, I\u2019d still opt to refill since there are so many better nic salt juices out there (ex flavor chaser). 
p13
aVI've heard great things about the Juul, but haven't tried it yet.  I tried the Von Erl, the Limitless (Plyrock) Pulse, and the Phix.  Von Erl died after a month.  Pulse has pods you need to fill yourself. Not too difficult but adds a bit of mess and complexity.  Phix is little more econonomical then Juul.  Phix pods hold a little more than the Juul pods and are 50mg of nicotine. For on the town and in the car,  I use the Phix.  If you are willing to deal with coil replacements and e-juice refilling, the Aspire Breeze works pretty good with some 25mg nicotine salt e-juice.
p14
aVWhats the big deal about the juuls?\u000a\u000aI see everyone using and buying all these juuls and phix\u2019s. 
p15
aVI've used the following:\u000a\u000a* **Suorin Air**  - refillable 2ml pods are nice. One went bad on the 2nd fill, but the other 2 I've tried lasted longer. Lots of posts about these failing. So far so good but I want to find a replacement.\u000a\u000a* **Phix** - I liked this device a lot, and really enjoyed the Butterscotch Tobacco but the pods spit back and leak to the point I was constantly blowing through it to clear juice before using.\u000a\u000a* **iCare v1** - hated this, constant dry hits and just bad performance.\u000a\u000a* **Envii Fitt** - this was pretty nice. Good variety of flavors, though the pods did leak some. Might try it again with refillable pods.\u000a\u000a* **Juul** - I used Juul for a year and a half but their QC is garbage, they seem to have changed the flavors some, and the popularity with high school kids means pods can be hard to find.\u000a\u000a* **Innokin Pocketmod** - So far this is my favorite of the bunch. Solid build, bulkier than the others but the 1.2ohm coils work well with nic salts. Will buy another.\u000a\u000a\u000aI also want to try the Fuchai v3, Warlock Peas, and Kimsun Slim 2R.
p16
aVI can refill them in under a minute but I\u2019ve done it many many times. Still in search of a refillable alternative that gives me the same experience. So far the phix has been the closest (just as good imo) but refilling them is harder than the Juul and they cost around the same price. 
p17
aVQuit smoking this week again. I\u2019m 65 years old, pack a day since 18 smoker. I found the pod system (phix) is good for taste and feel of a cigarette but doesn\u2019t supply the needed amount of nicotine. So I keep a mod on the side with high nicotine level juice. Between the two I fight off the urge to buy paper cigarettes. Next step refill the pods with stronger juice.
p18
aVI didn't enjoy the coils TBH, when they worked they worked well but that was limited to a day or two for me.  I'm sure my vaping style has something to do with that but how much I can't honestly say.  If you're not a heathen like me and rip them I think you'll have more success. What I can tell you is the Nautilus 2 was more reliable but the flavor was far better in the Amor NS.  The box itself wasnt bad, in a bind it made for a great bottle opener too.\u000a\u000aEDIT: I'm using a Suorin Drop now and a Smok  Infinix.  The Drop hasn't been a problem at all, I get a few fills on the pods and no catastrophic incidents.  The Infinix is a sample, it's Smok's answer to the Phix. I have been vaping CRFT salts lately, their mint is a spearmint and that just tickles me. 
p19
aVConstant and loud crackling from suorin air.\u000a\u000aI just got my suorin air a few days ago, and it is by far the best stealth vape I\u2019ve bought. It blows every other one on the mainstream market that I\u2019ve tried out of the water in my opinion (JUUL, PHIX, Vuse Vibe, Vuse solo *shudders* , Rubi, Eleaf). The only issue that I have is the constant and almost violent crackling that it produces every time I draw from it. Now I\u2019ve had clearomizers and all of the devices mentioned above, and I haven\u2019t had anything close to this kind of crackling. The worst part is that with the crackle, it produces a blast of hot air (sort of like a mini dry hit) that burns my throat. Could this be attributed to wicking problems, or something else?
p20
aVVery good note. Wasn't a fan of my pulse, refilled my phix once in a while but now my Suorin Air is acting up. Thinking maybe to get a mipod
p21
aVWas there a nicotine tax increase in Connecticut recently?\u000a\u000aI had an interesting experience at a local chain vape store today. I just got out of school and needed to pick up some Phix pods, and there's a vape store just a block away that I've been to a couple of times. It's not my preferred local brick and mortar but I decided to visit purely out of convenience. The employee behind the counter rings me up for my single item purchase while informing me of the recent "Connecticut nicotine tax increase". He told me my four pack of Phix pods (which I've been buying for months at $26 a pack) is now $35. It caught me by surprise, but I took his word for it because I'm not big into vaping politics. Only minutes later I run into one of my buddies who's an avid vaper and bring up this new nicotine price hike to him but he had no idea what I was talking about. I tried searching online but couldn't find anything about the new tax. I just wanted to know if it's actually true before I write a strongly worded email to the chain's corporate office informing them of the situation, and prevent myself from looking like a dumbass. 
p22
aVjust got a phix recently and when i go to draw it blinks and nothing comes out. Help? 
p23
aVHow can I prove to my parents that I don\u2019t vape/do drugs?\u000a\u000aI had a phix for about a week then go rid of it but my parents found out (the found the pods) yet they are still convinced that I still have it. How can I prove to them that I don\u2019t have it and I don\u2019t vape?
p24
aVJust switched from a big vape to...\u000a\u000aA "Phix" (its tiny and you just replace cartridges). I went into my local vape shop expecting to stock up on juices and atomizer replacements and the store owner was smoking this little thing. Had to ask why, apparently it delivers nicotine differently by a salt based nicotine which hits better? Had to buy it, the full setup with weeks of cartridges was about what I normally spend in a month anyway.\u000a\u000aReview after 1 day: At first it was a little harsh to hit but I like it... As much as my regular vape? Not really.\u000a\u000aDay 2: I'm in love!!! It's so simple (no fat clouds if you're into that, it's about the same as a regular cig) and delivers nictoine WAYYYYYYY better. I'm lightheaded right now as typing this which would never happen unless I got really high nic vape juice. This is only 5%\u000a\u000aHuge fan now and not sure if I'll ever switch back. Absolutely 0 maintenance and 0 problem so far. I actually have a little power bank that I just keep next to my computer so I can keep it / smoke it while its charging. Not sure how long battery life lasts.\u000a\u000aTl;dr  - I love the Phix, it's tiny with 0 maintance, just change cartridges (2 seconds) http://phixvapor.com/index.php/phix/\u000a\u000a(Not affiliated in anyway)
p25
aVWhen you say 'only' 5% remember that's 50mg/ml. The Phix only outputs something like 10w but even when we only had ego pens and MVP2s, the strongest shit generally available was 36mg. Not saying it's a good or a bad thing, but don't underestimate it.
p26
aVOk I did some research and from their site:\u000a\u000aEach PHIX pod contains 1.5mL with 5% nicotine by weight, approximately equivalent to 2 packs of cigarettes or 400 puffs.\u000a\u000aNot sure how that compared to normal vape but I'd normally go through a tank a day which I assume is around the same ?
p27
aVI am always on the lookout for small devices that pack some punch - good for quick hits at work, between flights, etc.\u000a\u000aI used Juul for a good year and a half but their QC is awful. They seem to have thinned out the liquid and cheaped out on flavors as they have all seemed to change in the last year and the pods burn through much faster, if they work at all.\u000a\u000aI just picked up a Suorin Air and love it so far. I have some nic salt 35mg (NKD 100) arriving today. It has 2ml refillable pods and hits really nicely so far.\u000a\u000aI've also tried the Phix, Envii Fit, and iCare at various times and neither really did the trick. The Phix pods had good flavor but so much spitback I had to blow through the pod to clear juice every so often. The original iCare was just not good and dry hit constantly. The Fit definitely came the closest, but the refillable pods weren't available at the time.
p28
aVLooking for recommendation: Pen/Pod style vape with micro-uSB Charger\u000a\u000aTo the point: Anyone know of a per/pod vape with a normal USB charging port? \u000a\u000a\u000abackground stuff: I have a Phix right now that I was enjoying. Lost the charger and ordered a new one from MLV as they were the only site that listed it in stock. Got an email 4 days later saying chargers are out of stock and they're expecting restock in 2 weeks. I don't care thaaat much because it's not my daily vape but I enjoy it from time to time and the wife likes to borrow it. Seems like all the vapes of that style use obnoxious proprietary charges though so I'm looking for something with just a normal micro-USB that can use any of the dozen cables I have floating around the house. Thanks!
p29
aVWhich pod do you recommend?\u000a\u000aI'm not sure which is the best between ( Juul, pulse, phix, my jet, mi pod). How long does the pod last?\u000aAny response would be appreciated, thank you!
p30
aVAny pod system you use with pre filled pods will only last you as long as you use it. Fill your own pods are good but the coils in them don't last very long if you chain vape them. Fillables are going to cost more dependent on juice. Pre filled pods are very expensive if you use them a lot because pods run dry. The phix has the largest pods I've used for pre filled. So that's my go to for a pre filled system. The suorin drop is my go to for fill your own. 
p31
aVUnfortunately, what else is out there in that category? The Phix?\u000a\u000aI *really* liked the Joyetech Dolphin, but it's hardly in the size class with the Peas. Basically the size of your standard configuration.
p32
aVthe phix it's a bigger battery, bigger pod version of the juul.
p33
aVIt depends on a lot of things. Do you want something that is similar to a cigarette or do you want something that will give you more of a hookah experience? Does size matter? Do you want simplicity or are you cool with adjusting/fiddling with things? Do you have a budget in mid? \u000a\u000aThe joyetech ego AIO is a solid device. It\u2019s a smallish all in one stick shaped/pen style battery and it performs very well.\u000a\u000aThe Phix is a really solid pod system (sort of a cigarette sized, flash drive shaped) device that feels as close to a cigarette as I\u2019ve found in a device.\u000a\u000aIf you want something that will perform like a hookah will, the istick pico and the super tank mini will be a good combo though it will require a separate battery. It can charge with USB though which is nice. You have adjustments and such that you can make to make it perform more like how you want it.\u000a\u000aThe istick pico and the nautilus 2 will give you a solid cigarette type inhale and will perform well too. \u000a\u000aHope I\u2019ve helped a bit, if you have more questions I\u2019ll be more than happy to help out and answer any more questions I can answer! 
p34
aVInteresting, they claim they use a temperature regulating technology to keep an optimal vaporizing experience so there is no combustion. Personally, I believe this is less temp control as we know it in modern devices as it is a fixed temperature that they keep it at. I\u2019ve used the Juul extensively when it came out and I\u2019ve never experienced anything close to temperature regulating technology. I\u2019ve had many burnt pods before the pods even dry. If they are using any sort of modern temp control in the device, it is very inaccurate and really doesn\u2019t work well in my experience. \u000a\u000aI guess the answer to ops question would be most likely no, there aren\u2019t any devices that use the same technology as the Juul, but devices such as the Phix would definitely be an improvement to  and an upgrade from the Juul. 
p35
aVI would never recommend the phix to anyone. It leaks like a stuck pig and pods taste burnt when juice level gets to about half way.

aVLooking to get into vaping, just for fun. I'm the type of person who buys gum not for the flavor but to blow bubbles. the type of person to learn skateboarding for tricks, not for quick transportation. \u000a\u000aSo where do I start? I don't care about the flavor, but I was smoking a cigar with a buddy and we were trying to do smoke tricks. I'd love to do it more but cigars are awful for you, so perhaps I could get a Vape with no nicotine or flavoring?\u000a\u000aWhat brand should I start with? What juice do I buy that has no nicotine or flavoring? As you can imagine, I'm unfamiliar with brands and parts of vape. I've only taken hits off my friend's juul and phix before.
p38
aVMy Suorin Air is burning all my pods\u000a\u000aI bought my Suorin Air about a week and a half ago. I read the instructions and waited 5-8 minutes before hitting it after filling up my pod with juice. Within the first day, my pod's coils burnt. I decided to buy a new pod hoping that maybe I ripped the first one a bit too often and that not all Suorin pods are like this. I started being super careful about hitting it, only hitting it at the most every 30 seconds and I'd often end up taking minutes between rips because I was scared of the coils in my pod burning. Later that night, my new pod got burnt. This has happened another 2 times, with me buying pods out of desperation because I've been looking for something more affordable (pods wise) than the Juul and the Phix. By the way, I'm using Mr. Salt -E juice\u000a\u000aHas this happened to anyone else before? Did I buy a messed up Suorin? I'd really appreciate y'all's insight :)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

aVPeople definitely make mistakes. I could easily be mistaken and you\u2019re in your 40\u2019s. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s a heads up and I won\u2019t say anymore about it.\u000a\u000aYou apologized for something that doesn\u2019t need apologizing for.

I hope you get a thread going that gets you some pods because the Juul isn\u2019t too terrible though I prefer the Phix. 
p41
aVThanks man. I actually appreciate that. I will take it off of this sub. And personally I like the juul. I have a few buddies that want refills for these, as I make my own juice. I have never heard of the Phix actually.

aVThe Phix is more reliable and more...cigarettey in my experience. Aside from that the flavors in the prefilled pods are better and the pods last me 3 times as long. I\u2019d totally recommend it. I have owned most pod based systems (Juul, Phix, von erl, bo, etc) and the Phix has been the best performing. 
p43
aVSee I smoked for 7 years prior to switching to a vape. Now it\u2019s just bulky and a hassle. I switched to the juul and really like the flavors I can put into. The charge is disappointing though. An hour, maybe an hour and a half. How\u2019s the charge on the phix?
p44
aVNo problem dude. Hope things go well and if you end up with the Phix I hope you enjoy that! 
p45
aVMy phix hits for 1-3 seconds then the light slowly dems and the hit stops... any solutions of ideas?\u000a\u000a
p46
aVI\ufe0f don\u2019t know what that other guy is talking about lol but this is my 4th phix... the last three made I\ufe0ft through 50 pods average or so but this one is on pods 20 (guesstimate). I\u2019ve never had a problem like this though... it\u2019s as if the hit is perfect and it\u2019s working fine and 2 seconds in the light slowly dims and the hit fades out to no draw at all
p47
aVBe careful with cleaning using isopropyl alcohol. From what I can tell the phix draws its airflow from the depths of mordor, or through the bottom of the pod, so if you\u2019re cleaning those contacts you might end up sucking in some isopropyl alcohol.
p48
aVnot sure if this is what you're looking for at all, but figured I'd throw it out there. there's a thing called the Bo which is similar to a Juul/Phix/etc. and the tobacco pods for them taste exactly like a honey berry Backwoods

aVWas about 19 or 20 and hated the fact that I constantly smelled of smoke and hated that I woke up every morning coughing and wheezing until I had a cig. Went out to a Gorilla Vapes shop near me. Spent about $80 on an ego style battery and a kanger Aero or something like that. Basic MTL setup with coil heads. Used it for a month or so and then the cigarette withdrawal hit me like a truck and was hacking up goo. Went right back to cigs to not feel like shit. Fast forward 3 years or so and there I was trying to get my life in check. Basically hated myself every time I finished a cigarette. Constantly told myself that this is my last pack until I bit the bullet and spent around $70 on a smok G150 starter kit and some juice. Still smoked cigs but I started vaping and slowly got off the stinkies and started feeling so much better health wise. Went through about 2 weeks of wheezing and congestion but got through it by diving head first into this rabbit hole. Bought myself a Goon RDA, a Therion 166, bunch of wires and prebuilts, and a bunch of juice as well as a Phix and then an Aspire Breeze down the line to help with the strong urges every now and then. Now I fucking despise cigs and I only have one if I\u2019m plastered drunk and all my batteries are dead. Even then I can\u2019t even finish the whole thing without feeling sick to my stomach. Good reminder to never buy another pack haha. \u000a\u000aNow I have a bunch of atomizers and juices and my new addiction is chasing flavor. Which I STILL can\u2019t find my happy place with haha.

aVAnyone interested in Baja Blast flavored juice?\u000a\u000aI made a post here a while ago about baja blast salt nic juice I was working on. I have the formula from my old ejuice company selling regular vape juice and I\u2019ve adapted it to work in the juul / phix / sourin drop, it\u2019s turned out to be pretty awesome and I feel i\u2019ve perfected the flavor. \u000a\u000aJust wondering if anyone else wanted some of this to refill their pods/devices. If you\u2019re interested just send me an email at bajablastpods@gmail.com and I can ship you a bottle of baja blast nic salt juice. I also have a mango flavor that\u2019s a lot better than the popular ejuice companies if anyone is interested. \u000a\u000aThe flavor and overall quality is way better in my opinion than a lot of the popular refill juices. It\u2019s not overly harsh and I only used the highest quality nic salts and ingredients so it\u2019s a very smooth flavor that doesn\u2019t burn your mouth while still delivering a great throat hit and buzz. It\u2019s what i\u2019m vaping now so if anyone\u2019s interested just send me an email and let me know. \u000a\u000aIt\u2019s finally ready, available in regular nicotine and nicotine salts.

aVI like vaping, but have some concerns. In short, all the men of my ancestry were smokers, as it\u2019s somewhat of a cultural activity. Not just that, but we smoked quite heavy. After many failed attempts to quit back in the day, I bought a Phix (which is terrible) and a few early Smok mods (even worse), and was eventually able to quit the stinkies entirely. Eventually, I began to fall in love with RDAs, making clean builds to my preference, mod design, etc. I also became a flavor connoisseur, and I loved the variety of flavors. Cigs taste like burnt asshole. I then got fascinated by smoke tricks, and practiced doing jellyfishes and spamming. I now can do most all tricks, and it\u2019s something I\u2019ve learned to build confidence in.\u000a\u000aOn the flip-side, I hate how the dangers of vaping are still relatively unknown. Sure, tons of studies say it\u2019s terrible for you, but as we seen, many of these studies have bullshit analyses and are funded by big pharma. Additionally, studies showing the health benefits of vaping can be equally lacking in variable consideration, etc. I wish I knew definitively whether vaping was helping my body, as I can only suppose through anecdotal evidence that it is. I also feel like, because of this, lots of bigots in society can view you as someone who is stupidly engaging in this new, widespread unhealthy activity. In essence, us as vapers simply trying to quit stoges are put in a situation where we\u2019re caught between competing interests where big pharma is fighting against it, while advocates lack resources to properly study/fight for it. \u000a\u000aI really like the Drop RDA. It\u2019s actually my go-to. It brings out notes in dessert flavors that I haven\u2019t experienced with many RDAs. 
p56
aVSo, with nicotine salts. even if it says 30-60mg nicotine, it\u2019s not going to be as harsh as you think it would. For example, if you vaped 12mg freebase vs 55mg nic salts, typically the freebase will be more harsh. Nicotine salts are just smoother vapes. Similarly, 3mg nicotine = smoother than 3mg freebase. Keep in mind, though, that nic salts can buzz the fuck out of you if you\u2019re not used to them. Moving on, nic salts have more of a \u201csharp,\u201d cigarette-like draw, while high freebase is obviously more \u201cscratchy.\u201d \u000a\u000anicotine salts are most popular done through:\u000a\u000aclosed systems - which are non-refillable vapes that you must pre-filled pods for such as the Juul, Phix, and Kilo 1k. In essence, much of these devices mimic a cigarette. Thus, they\u2019re the most convenient option, but also arguably the most expensive. (Bout 20-25 bucks for 4 pack of pods usually). \u000a\u000aRefillable systems: These are pretty much what it says. That is, a vape in which you can buy EMPTY pods for, and you refill them with whatever nicotine salt juice you like (optimum hit at 30-50mg depending on your preference). Typically, you get about 5-10 refills before the pod goes bad, then you get more. I want to point out that there\u2019s also refillable nicotine salt devices that use coils, as opposed to pods. Same exact principle, though. So if you want a pod mod some good ones are: renova zero, smoant s8, Smok infinix and Novo, Suorin Drop/Air. For coil refillable: Breeze 1, 2, and nautilus are pretty popular. You can also subohm with innokin zenith thank.\u000a\u000aJust do research on a few nicotine salt devices, and see which ones you think you\u2019ll like. I personally use the Smoant s8 for nic salt because it\u2019s reliable af.

aVNJOY ACE - Quick Review - Best Disposable Pod System out there\u000a\u000aI took advantage of the Black Friday deals (Vuse Vibe, Alto, and NJoy Ace) and have used a wide variety of pod systems out there (most popular ones: myVonErl/MyBlu, Juul, Phix, etc)\u000a\u000aI LOVE the NJOY Ace\u000a\u000aPros\u000a\u000a- Feels VERY premium and very nice in the hand (Makes the Vuse Alto, Vibe, and MyBlu feel like cheap plastic that will snap in your hand after using the Ace which has a nice heft to it)\u000a\u000a- Pods are decent sized (1.9 mL I believe)\u000a\u000a- Battery life is great, easily lasts a full day of solid vaping\u000a\u000a- Juice flavors i tried were awesome (favorite right now is the Watermelon Twist and BlueBerry - still have Tobacco, Menthol to try)\u000a\u000a- Pods are affordable since NJOY is always running a sale there has been a 20% and two 30% off coupons since Black Friday. Sign up for the subscription to get an additional $1 off per box and you can get 10 boxes (20 pods total) for roughly $70 or $3.50-3.75 a pod.\u000a\u000a- Pods do NOT LEAK AT ALL. NO SPITBACK, no bubbling of juice at the tip like the myBlu / Vuse Vibe\u000a\u000a- Strong nicotine buzz (50% or 50mg) but seriously barely ANY throat hit, i have to set the device down on a far table so I dont chain vape since it literally feels like you are vaping a 6mg nicotine juice. When I vape the NJoy Ace and Vuse Alto back to back the Alto has a CONSIDERABLY stronger throat hit despite having basically the same strength of nicotine\u000a\u000a- Pods seal into the device via magnets and the seal is tight and doesnt jiggle much\u000a\u000a- Micro-USB charging cable (no dealing with bullshit magnetic chargers that fail - looking at you Vuse Alto and Juul) \u000a\u000a- Charging is very quick via USB\u000a\u000a- Better than average clouds / vapor production\u000a\u000a- Full feeling throat hit in terms of vapor without the harshness\u000a\u000aCons:\u000a\u000a- Dont know if the pods are refillable so this may be a con for some\u000a\u000a- Drip tip may be weird for some users but i dont mind it\u000a\u000a- Soft touch plastic on the device itself may attract some fingerprints\u000a\u000a- havent seen these pods in stores so you will have to order the pods and they do take about 3-5 days to arrive but shipping is free\u000a\u000aHonestly, Ive tried many pod systems and vaped extensively using tanks for over 2 years. This is by far my favorite vaping device I have ever used. Feels awesome, great vapor production, great nicotine buzz, relatively cheap pods that are always on sale, tasty juice - i would recommend this to beginners easily and even experienced vapors looking for a quick, concealable, clean, hassle free vape\u000a\u000aI know this review may come off sounding like a shill but after struggling to find a replacement for my MyBlu and after HATING the Vuse Vibe and Alto (liked the Alto's throat hit more, Vibe's flavors were very weak and nasty tasting compared to the NJoy - which even topped myBlu for me in terms of flavor) I am relieved to have finally found a convenient vaping solution that doesnt require dealing with dud / burnt coils, priming coils, cleaning out tanks, dealing with leaking etc etc.\u000a\u000aIf you think about it an average coil costs $2-4 let's say $3. Decent juice we will say is roughly $15 for 30 ml or 50 cents for 1 mL. Let's say you get 3 tanks out of one refillable pod from a popular pod mod system (what most people say they can get without the flavor tasting like crap or being muted). That's 6 mL of juice or $3, plus the cost of the coil $3 or $6 for 3 pods.\u000a\u000a$2 a pod when you refill it yourself and buy replacement coils/pods and juice or you can just buy these pods for $3.50-3.80 a pod.\u000a\u000aFor $1.50 you get the convenience of popping a pod in and going about your day, for me it's worth it.\u000a\u000aIf anyone wants some comparisons between the Ace and the myBlu or Vibe or Alto lemme know in the comments would be happy to help!\u000a\u000a\u000a

aVNew Phix Pods mute air flow\u000a\u000aI am using new phix device with original phix pods (ice &amp; spearmint) with no issues, but today i bought one pack to new original tobacco pods, but there is no airflow, i have to heavy lung inhale to get any vapor, is that any way to tweak this?

aVVladdin Re Pods working in Phix?\u000a\u000aI saw a post that someone said the Vladdin refillable pods work in the Phix. Has anyone tried this? 
p60
aVI don't have a Phix but I have an RE in my hand and I don't see how it's possible. I just looked up the Phix and the pods look nothing alike. The Vladdin has a very unique shape with a heavy angle at the top. I can't confirm they'll work or not but I highly doubt it.
p61
aVOdd, I think they look very much alike. I have two Vladdins, but no Phix to try.
p62
aVYou sure like to brag about your equipment. LOL I have two of them as well. They're similar in shape I guess but they look totally different. And having two Vladins you should know the pods are uniquely curved with a slant at the top rather than flat looking without the matching angle of the Phix. 
p63
aVBrag about equipment? How do you figure? I did stock up before 8/8/2016 and didn't buy a single thing vape related in 2017 (not even juice, wire, batteries, or anything), so I missed out on everything that year. And in 2018, I am stocking up again just in case the FDA does drops the hammer. There are tons of devices and atties I don't even have.\u000a\u000aI just know about what I have. And the first time I saw a Vladdin, I thought that looks very much like an updated Phix. One Youtube reviewer even said about the same thing and they have both. Darn, they didn't mention if the pods are interchangeable though. And I wouldn't discount the idea that a Vladdin RE pod wouldn't work in a Phix. It looks very close to me. Maybe I should order a Phix and find out for sure. ;)

aVIf you plan on quitting smoking and vaping don't use extremely high nictoine\u000a\u000aBefore I get downvoted into oblivion just hear me out. I'm not saying it's impossible, a lot of people have used either closed pod systems or regular pod systems with high nic and quit all together, it has been done. All I'm saying is that if you start off with 35mg and higher with a pod system it becomes just as hard as quitting smoking. I have been using a phix at 50mg for 7 months and I'll tell you that I am addicted to this thing like It was cigarettes and can not go longer than an hour with out taking a hit, i originally got it for work because I was tired of clunking around a rx 2/3 (In 2 mode) and a twisted messes v1 with a 15ml unicorn bottle but I got immediately hooked and sold every device I owned and used that money for pods. Now I get moody and irritated when I don't have it, if I forget when I leave I have panic attacks, shit, just thinking about stopping gives me panic attacks. I remember before pod systems and super high I was dripping 3mg for 3 years and was fine, I could go like 4 or 5 days without a toot before I started to get a craving and 10 days before I started getting crabby and taking fits. I could have easily stopped vaping though but now with this phix and 50mg I don't think I can, it's like I'm addicted to cigarettes all over again. If you have no intention of every quitting vaping or lowering nicotine then closed pod systems and high nic are great but if you want to taper yourself off and quit stay far away from closed pod systems that only offer 50+mg because you are just going to back pedal   \u000a

aVThis is the best Nic salt pod system in 2018\u000a\u000aI was struggling to find the best pod system in the market because I just simply want to make my workdays less painful, and I've tried Juul, Phix, Breeze 2, SMOK NOVO, Lost Vape Orion and finally, ZQ came up and man this is what I really want, deeply from my heart :'( But surprisingly, i found that almost no one is talking about this system. \u000a\u000aAll the pod systems have annoying cons: breeze 2's drip tip is literately the pain in my ass and the its coil has no quality control at all, only 1 out of 3 can actually work! Lost Vape Orion's pods are unbelievably overpriced and not suitable for Nic Salt at all. Please don't buy any pod system from SMOK and for those of you still think SMOK rocks, please just try something else. But ZQ doesn't, I can't find any con from this amazingly perfect device. God, that flavor, ZQ is the only pod system I've tried that can actually give you flavor. Breeze 2 has no flavor to serve you at all, no flavor! \u000a\u000aI live in China so I could easily get this, the device is about $20 and the pod is about $3 each. Just want to remind the guys that are still searching for the best pod system for work, you should give this a shot, and don't waste your money on Breeze 2, please. And the reviewers, before you post your best of 2018, try this, please. I just don't get it why nobody's talking about this. No, I'm not sponsored because ZQ is also designed by Aspire, and breeze 2 is a waste of money, bro.\u000a\u000a[No,  don't try Breeze 2 ](https://i.redd.it/b5picgan79021.jpg)
