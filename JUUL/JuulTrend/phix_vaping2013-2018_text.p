VBest pod mod system?\u000a\u000aSo I am looking for something smaller and more discrete than my normal rig and am considering a pod system vape.  I hear there are some great ones out there and want the community's advice.  I know a couple big names out there are Juul, my von earl, my jet, sauron air, phix and Blu. I really like brewelle and am leaning to towards the phix but hear that pod leaking is a problem. \u000a\u000aI want something that has a decent throat hit, small clouds and minimal problems.  The cheaper the better.

aVNever vaped but want to start vaping with CBD. Need help\u000a\u000aSo I\u2019ve never owned a vape before but more recently have been interested in the effects of CBD. I need help with figuring out how I\u2019m gonna go about this. \u000a\u000aI\u2019m not a smoker so I don\u2019t really need nicotine. I wanted something small like a Juul, Eon, Phix, Baton, etc. I understand the pods for those companies are nicotine based but I also saw that you can refill those pods with whatever juice you want so I thought I could just refill them with some CBD juice. \u000a\u000aThe Baton caught my eye because the pods are made to be refilled and they even say you can refill it with CBD. But if I were to buy one of these company\u2019s device and pod, how many times can I realistically reuse the same pod? Is there even a limit? \u000a\u000aAgain I don\u2019t really want something that large. The size of something like the Juul is perfect for what I want. If anyone can help me figure out what to buy/do, it would be greatly appreciated. \u000a\u000a

aVBuy a phix! It's more expensive than traditional vaping but still a lot cheaper than cigarettes. It runs on a pod system, 1 pod lasts me about 3 days and I hit it constantly. You can buy a pack of 4 pods for 21.99 online if you find the right place and it is really discrete! I sit at my computer with my stepdad behind me and use the spearmint flavor and just chew gum. Can't smell or hear anything and ghosting the hits are really easy. Good luck!

aVVaping at Disney: What to Know\u000a\u000aJust completed a week at Disney Word in Orlando. I was very nervous about bringing anything at all but I knew I would need the nic. Here\u2019s my experience and advice: \u000aLike I said, I was a little skeptical about bringing anything at all. I knew it would be packed and I assumed Disney World would be very anti vaping. I was actually surprised to find the opposite. At first I carried around my phix, it\u2019s like a Juul (pen). I would hit it only when I wasn\u2019t surrounded by people which was very hard at Disney, but I still found time. 3rd day in I decided to bring my mech and some juice. So, before you get into Disney you have to empty your pockets and walk through a metal detector. I put my mech and juice in the bowl, walked through, and awaited a long line of questioning, of which never came. The man just smiled and said have a good day. It was the same every day after that. They do not care. I only had one person actually pick it up and check it out. Now, on to actually vaping at Disney. My advice, do not be a nuisance. If you\u2019re in a large crowd of people, have people behind you, or are waiting in line, just don\u2019t vape. Disney has a few different designated smoking areas but I didn\u2019t use one at all. I would wait for an empty spot, take a hit, hold it in (reduces cloud size), then I would always make sure to blow it in a direction away from people. It wasn\u2019t a pain and made Disney 10x more magical due to the fact that I could still rip some sick clouds #vapenation #gogreen And the guards/workers didn\u2019t seem to care one bit. But it was because I used common sense and I would advise anyone wanting to vape at Disney to do the same. Use your head. If I had a kid I wouldn\u2019t want some stranger blowing anything in his face (yes yes take it away, Michael Scott).\u000aIn conclusion, use your brain, choose a proper time to vape, and enjoy Disney. Feel free to shoot any questions my way.

aVI've went through quite a few mtl devices like the breeze.\u000a\u000a\u000a-Limitless pulse is a great pod pen that is basically a long juul that is refillable.\u000a\u000a-Icare2 is a pretty good mtl that is a great upgrade to the 1 despite having iffy coils\u000a\u000a-Vaporesso Aurora is a nifty zippo like mtl that looks like a slightly bigger zippo lighter\u000a\u000a-Phix is kinda garbage and tried to live off the juul hype but due to overpriced pods and difficult refilling the prejuiced pods I can't recommend it\u000a\u000a-Suorin Air is my current mtl nic salt mod and I really like it. Basically a thicker credit card with auto pull but I have heard mixed reviews about the coils.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAll of these I can add more to but I'm on mobile and didn't want to type forever for no reason.
p5
aVJuul, penguin, or a Phix would be a good next step
p6
aVThere's also a similar product to the JUUL called the Phix. They both work pretty much the same and are about the same size, but with different designs and names.
p7
aVflying with a phix or juno\u000a\u000a[removed]
p8
aVIt looks like a phix to me they are pretty comparable to a juul 
p9
aV&gt; Looks like a phix to me\u000a\u000aBro it says "bo" on the bottom 
p10
aVif you are wanting something small I would say a phix which is really just a bigger version of the juul but I would say the best thing to do is just go into a local shop and look at some starter kits they have so u can actually look and hold them things like that and see if it is something that your brother would like. There area ton of starters out there now that dont cost a ton just the matter of finding the right one that is right for you. I am sure that there is someone that can help you more then I can. Still new to vaping but when I started I just went into a shop and sat down with someone there and they answered all my questions and really helped me out.

aVPhix light flickering while charging\u000a\u000aTried charging my phix on a charging brick I never used before and the light is on like it's charging but it is flickering between bright and brighter. Maybe I've never noticed this before but it seems odd just wondered if anyone knows what's happening. I've yet to test it on other places I've charged it prior to this because I'm at work right now.
p13
aVThere are so many better and cheaper alternatives to a juul. If you\u2019re interested in pod system vaporizers with high levels of nicotene, check out the limitless pulse, aspire brez, or even the phix. And as for the juice, Mr salt eliquid is fairly cheap and it is salt based (also know as nicotene in its acidic form) from 25-45mg.  
p14
aVIf you want to quit tobacco, try getting a phix or a Juul. Higher nicotine and has the same throat hit as a cigarette; it's definitely helped me a lot! 
p15
aVThe phix is very similar and slightly more restrictive pull. I really enjoy mine. 
p16
aVI wouldn't recommend the T18 because 45 nic salt will literally make you choke. I have always been a big fan of Phix by MLV but you can't really fill your own juice. So I recently just picked up the iCare 2 which has been working really well for me, I am using nic salt 50 mg. Yes, coils for the iCare 2 is some what inconsistant, but it has been helping me save a lot of money and when the coil is working right, it's amazing. I would say 3 - 4 out of 5 works great and 1 - 2 defective. Also check out Aspire Breeze, a lot of my friends use them and seems to like them. The newest one that I saw is the Vaperesso, forgot the model but it looks like a sport car key fob with carbon fiber wrapping. Hope this helps
p17
aVhelp!! accidentally checked my phix at airport\u000a\u000ai\u2019m 18, a senior in high school, and recently got a Phix pod-based vape. it\u2019s at the bottom of my checked luggage because the guy asked us if we had any electronic cigarettes in our checked luggage as i was standing with my mom. so, now it\u2019s checked. what will happen to it? do you think that since the phix is such a small and discreet device it might go through ok?
p18
aVyes, this is what I figured. I guess most of my worry was that since the phix is such a unique looking e-cig that they wouldn\u2019t find it/see it in the x-ray. I\u2019m at my layover now, though, and the plan never blew up, nor did my parents receive a call from TSA about their son\u2019s attempt at terrorism by vape, so I think I\u2019ll be okay.
p19
aVAspire Clito 120 Tank and a Asmodus Minikin Boot 155watt. \u000a\u000aThat or you could go with Smok, they have the Alien kit that comes with a Baby Beast and mod it's self, I started on the top one I recommend, really good starter kit and will keep you going for quite some time, it is no where near as small as a pen mod though, you could look at a Bo or Phix if you wanted another pen mod. :)

aVBest Stealth Vape for Nicotine Salts\u000a\u000aI have owned both a juul and phix and I love them with all of my heart. However, pods are fucking expensive. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s where I live but pods run about $30 here and that doesn\u2019t last me more than a week. I\u2019m looking into getting a pod style vape I can use nicotine salts in. So far I\u2019ve come up with the iCare 2 and the Aspire Breeze. If you have any new recommendations or experiences with these devices I\u2019d love to hear them!
p21
aVJuul vs. PHIX\u000a\u000aI've been looking into going for a pure nicotine delivery device for on the go satisfaction, and I've found these two to be the most interesting but I can't decide which one to go with. Opinions?
p22
aVI\u2019ve had both so I can inform you on things with these two. First off with the pods, the Juul has way better flavor and the pods are cheaper, but they contain almost 1ml less than Phix pods. The juul has a smoother delivery while the phix hits harsher, but both give you that instant chill effect. Juul is smaller, phix is bigger. Juul is also louder when drawing, if that matters at all to you. I prefer the Juul over the Phix but either one is a good choice. 
p23
aVSounds like pods are for you. Please **don't** get any Smok products. Though I have not used one, I would suggest Phix, Juul or Sourin Air. I'm sure the more experienced ones will chime in.
p24
aVThis was my first too! Wasn't able to quit smoking until I bought myself a Phix tho.
p25
aVWhat about flavor? I've since purchased a phix. This thing tastes like a shitty rda or a decent sub ohm tank. It's crazy. Of course, it's proprietary pods/juice. But I taste melon.
p26
aVHow do you get that sticker on the phix
p27
aVI just got the phix.  It\u2019s very discreet and pretty powerful for a quick fix of nicotine 
p28
aVI bought a phix for longer rides where I can't drip and it's been supplementing really well. Luckily I know the length of the lights on my way to work in the morning so dripping isn't much of an issue. If I don't have my coffee and nicotine on my ride in I'm an irritable little shit lol
p29
aVI love all the new pod system, however the Juul is not as good as the PHIX by MLV. I think until today with all these pod system products on the market, the PHIX is still the best. 
p30
aVWhat juice do you use in it?\u000a\u000aI ordered some 40 and 45mg salt e juice and I am worried that it might be too strong because I hear the Sauron air hits harder than the phix or juul.
p31
aVWattages, Ohms, and Voltage?\u000a\u000aSo I've had a phix and have been using it for about a year now and I've decided to move onto a mod. But I'm being met by all this customization features and being a little intimidated by it. I don' understand what effects each and how different modes and temperatures can change things. Could someone give me a brief explanation to how this can affect things?
p32
aVChest Pain When Hitting Vuse, Phix, Penguin, etc.\u000a\u000aI've recently gotten into vaping and I am currently using my own mini mod with 0mg juice. Whenever I use one of my buddies Vuse, Phix, or Penguin I start coughing mid hit and then I get this sharp chest pain in the middle of my chest for about 20 seconds. I don't know why it is happening but because of it I can't hit any of those without feeling extremely uncomfortable. When I take a hit from a vape with 20mg+ I don't feel that chest pain, it's only from those e-cig pens. Any thoughts?
p33
aVYeah I know what you mean.\u000a\u000aHonestly I'd say your best bet is to stay with the juul or get a phix or something else with salt nic because it is the closest to a cigarette that your gonna get.
p34
aV100 percent get a juul or a phix for Ur mum.\u000a\u000aThey use salt nicotine which absorbs faster and has better throat hit like a cigarette and it uses pods so it's extremely simple to use and there won't be any problems usually.
p35
aVAfter breaking 4 Juuls, I switched to the Phix, which I actually liked better, until it broke. Now I'm vaping on an Aspire Plato. The juice in a Juul/Phix is definitely more satisfying when trying to get off tobacco, I personally would say wait until after the cravings end before you try and switch to something that is going to give you a straight to lung hit because it doesn't resemble a cig as much as the mouth the lung high nic hits do 
p36
aVI have personally never liked a tank/mod mouth to lung setup nearly as much as the Phix or Juul and there is only like one company that sells juice remotely close to the juice you are currently vaping in the pods. Just letting you know before you try to upgrade or whatever and can't get nearly as good of a hit

p38
aVThe Phix has bigger pods more airflow, bigger hit/cloud, same juice but better flavors, and it's cheaper and the charging works better, IMO. You could theoretically find the 5% salt juice online and put it in some kind of mouth-to-lung Vape setup but after going through that it will hit about the same as the pod set up did. Or you could try sub-ohming like 12 mg if you really want to rape your throats and get that quick nic 
p39
aVget a phix
p40
aVI tried a bo and a phix at my local shop and ended up going with the phix for a few reasons. It has a higher nicotine strength and the draw is a lot more restricted, very similar to a cig. I think both are fine but I'm getting amazing battery life out of the phix. A few drags and I'm all nicced up 
p41
aVThanks! I ordered a nautilus 2 tank to try it out, but if I'm not happy I'll look into the phix
p42
aVJuul pod contains "50" mg of nicotine in each pod per milligram of juice. I am not sure if they are using Nic salt, but I own a couple of Phix by MLV and I am hooked on the nic salt liquids. I recently just purchased the Eleaf iCare 2 which you can fill your own nic salt juices and the store by my house carries many freat flavors from popular brands that I can trust. So far I am loving it. I also have a few friends who uses Juuls on their daily basic but converted to the Eleaf iCare 2 because it's so much cheaper and last way long. The iCare last almost 2 days per charge and a 30ml bottle of Nic salt liquid is about $25 - $30. A bottle of 30 ml can lasts me up to 3 weeks. So I think you're looking to get a MTL device, the iCare is a device I recommend. It'a just about twice the size of a Juul but same length.
p43
aVMy local shops seem to favor phix over juul. I picked one up last week and honestly I'm a pretty big fan. 
p44
aVI still have regular box mods and I\u2019ve also started using the Phix it\u2019s a bigger version of the Juul

aVGetting A Phix\u000a\u000a[removed]
p46
aVI personally don't own the pulse but I have used it a good amount. I like pulse more than any other pod system (myjet, juul, phix, etc.) But I personally prefer the mi-one just because I rather fill with my own juice. I don't have any cons other than because of its size the coil is easy to flood. If you do like pod systems however, mi-one has developed their own pods so I recommend you check those out!
p47
aVYe I can't reccomend a juul or phix enough they are both good.

aVugh i have the phix, its way worse than the juul, but my juul got stolen XD\u000a
p54
aVI'd *HIGHLY* recommend a phix or a juul for your father and maybe a vaporesso revenger for yourself.
p55
aVYe I'm talking about the juul and the phix specifically.\u000a\u000aThey are really similar to a cigarette and they both use 52mg with nicotine salts which means it's slot more like a cigarette throat hit/buzz and also they look really nice and are compact
p56
aVHave you ever heard of a Juul or a phix?
p57
aVsmallest they come is cartridge based devices like the JUUL and the Phix by MLV.\u000a\u000athat being said, there are plenty of small all-in-one vapes that are great for concealment.\u000a\u000athe Eleaf Icare, Smok Vape pen 22, wismec MY JET\u000a\u000athis totally depends on preference.\u000a\u000aJUUL and PHIX both use high concentrations of Nicotine Salts, which have twice as much of a nicotine hit, just alot smoother than free base.\u000a\u000aDo a little research and find which one is best for you.
p58
aVTry the phix by mlv hits a lot softer. Good pod flavors and a charger thats cool and works very well
p59
aVSame buzz as a juul from a vape?\u000a\u000aHey guys, I'm a noob at vaping and have some questions. Ive had experiences with the juul and Phix (don't know what the general consensus about those is on this subreddit) and they give me a really good buzz. I've never smoked cigarettes before. I recently picked up a SMOK Stick v8, and I'm just not getting a similar buzz. Is it possible? I'm using 3mg juice, which the guy at the store said was pretty high.\u000a\u000aThanks! Vape on!
p60
aVI suggest looking on YouTube and search for review shootouts. Search \u000aJUUL, my von erl, phix, Bo, cig-a-likes, Penguin, Aurora, iCare, Breeze. Others will also pop up as you watch. Personally, refillable ones I feel are the more economical option.
p61
aVI need serious advice\u000a\u000aSorry for the long text but to give you some back story. I live in New Jersey, and I've been vaping for about 2 years. I wanted a small pod system device and that system was the wismec myjet. I loved my girlfriends and wanted one of my own. My girlfriend purchased me one from this vape shop. I used it for a day and finally realized yesterday that there is no airflow hole. I compared it to the one my girlfriend bought and there is a tiny hole on the side of the battery to allow air into the pod. Mine did not have that. It became very difficult after changing my pod to take a hit on it. I called the vape shop and asked what can they do about it, they told me they can't do anything about it and I have to contact wismec, while I understand I wanted to speak to the owner. The guy on the phone told me the owner was not in the store. So I called the next day to speak to the owner and a different guy answered the phone and told me she wasn't in today but to bring it by to see if they can work something out. I drove to the store right after getting off the phone and the owner is there. I found that strange but continued and they told me that they can only give me store credit. Well they upsold me on a phix and told me how easy it is to refill it, they even said it was made to do that after I said I don't want something you have to manipulate to be refillable. They told me it was made to be refillable. So I purchased 2 one for me and my mom to get her to stop smoking. Stupid me for not doing my research I know. But on my way out they told me I can keep the myjet I brought it and without skipping a beat and with complete seriousness told me I should drill a hole into the battery to get the airflow. I was shocked and asked if he was serious and told me yea. After I leave and get home I explain it to my girlfriend and she says that the owner was probably there both times I called because when she was in there buying the myjet originally they said she wasn't in the store when someone called but the owner was right next to the guy. I then researched the phix and they even say on phix's website for health reasons do not try to refill phix pods. I was lied to many times and tricked into buying 2 new vaporizers and then telling me to drill into a battery. I'm afraid more people will go into there and with their advice will be screwed out of money and quite possible hurt themselves with the advice from the employees. So now I have 2 devices I don't even want cause it's not what they told me it was supposed to be and a shop giving horrible advice for customers. What can I do to maybe get some of my money back and warn people about the shop? I'm just more worried about the advice they give to people. Again sorry for the long text. Thanks in advance for the advice.
p62
aVThanks for the heads up. I was planning on ditching it anyways and getting a juul or Phix instead. 
p63
aVIt's gonna be kind of hard to say no starter kits since it's an all in one device.\u000a\u000a[The Smok Vape Pen 22](http://www.smoktech.com/kit/vape-pen-22) has a similar design, but a produces slightly more Vapor.\u000a\u000aIf you wanted to go even stealthier than that, I would recommend using nicotine salts in a [eleaf icare](http://www.eleafworld.com/icare/) or pod based devices like the [JUUL](https://www.juulvapor.com) and [Phix](http://www.majorleaguevapers.com/phix-starter-kit/).\u000a\u000aLet me know which one you like and I'll tell you about each and every one of them\u000a\u000a

aVThc infused juul/phix pods\u000a\u000aI'm planning on making thc vape juice with vegetable glycerin.

I  realized that I could make a ton of profit because I could fill over 130 juul pods or 75 phix pods and sell those for $10 to $20 a pop.. I already got a ton of people that want to help me sell all them I just don't know how to get all empty pods or if it'll even be remotely potent. Does anyone have remotely any experience with this to know if this is worth it?

aVMyJet Issues - Recs on a new Ultra-Portable Vape\u000a\u000aSo, I've been loving on the MyJet for about 4-5 months now. While pod prep and the product specific charger are what I consider to be the product's low points. Once I learned how to DIY re-wick the pods for multi-use I became a die-hard convert for this device.\u000a\u000aSadly, after month's of daily use, and a hundred plus recharges, I'm starting to suspect the device has reached some point of obsolescence. When I draw and then take my mouth off the intake, the coil continues to spark as if I was still drawing on it. The only way to stop it is to pull the pod out.\u000a\u000aCrazy thing is, once I put the pod back in, it lights up again as if I was inhaling. The only way I've gotten it to stop is to take the pod out and use a pen cap and depress one of the connectors to shut off the power before putting the pod back in.\u000a\u000aAnyone else run in to life longevity issues with their MyJet's? I worry that with leakage, over time it eventually gets around the seals to pollute the electronics.\u000a\u000aAs for replacements, so far I've been disappointed with contained coils devices. I bought an iCare Solo on the cheap to get me through the day, and while I like it, the flavor and throat hit just don't compare. Say what you will about those damn pods, but when it comes to flavor and throat hit, I just can't beat that RTA-style wick and coil. The JUUL and similar pre-filled pods don't appeal to me cause of flavor limitations and cheaper than average coil construction for DIY re-wicking, but if anyone has opinions on the following, I'd be grateful to hear them.\u000a\u000a[Twelve Juno](https://www.vapordna.com/Twelve-Juno-Ultra-Portable-Full-Kit-p/twljno.htm)\u000a\u000a[Black Market BO](https://www.vapordna.com/Black-Market-BO-One-Ultra-Portable-Pod-System-p/bmbops.htm) \u000a\u000a[Limitless Rock Pulse](https://www.vapordna.com/Limitless-Mod-Co-Ply-Rock-Pulse-Pod-System-p/lmcplc.htm)\u000a\u000a[MLV Phix Ceramic Wick](https://www.vapordna.com/MLV-Phix-Ceramic-Wick-Ultra-Portable-Kit-p/mlvphx.htm) While the ceramic coil probably negates DIY rebuilds, the novelty of it piques my interest.

aVPhix not producing vapor, plz help!
p70
aVHey guys so I bought the Phix 4 days ago and it has been working fine until very recently. It charges fine and lights up when I inhale but doesn't make any vape. I tinkered around a bit and noticed that the one gold pin is lower than the other (picture is bad sorry). I think it may not be making a good connection with the pod. Anyone have any ideas or advice? 
p71
aVI don't have a phix but I do have a juul. What I did to fix it was clean it with a q tips and isopropyl alcohol. With the pin issue I'd probably try and press the pin down slightly and see if it moves. If it can try to move it until it is level with the other pin.
p72
aVHow long does a phix pod last?\u000a\u000aI've been traveling a lot and bringing a box mod and a bottle of juice around or in my pocket with keys and whatnot has been annoying. Saw the phix and was immediately interested.  I go through about 5-6ml of 6mg juice in a day.  So how long do you think a phix pod will last me?  
p73
aVPhix by MLV\u000a\u000aI've just recently purchased my phix, and it was hitting beautifully for the first week or so. After I went through my first pack of pods I knew I had to try another flavor when I recievd my new pack of butterscotch pods I noticed moisture in the packaging itself along with leakage from each pod. I'm now getting an incredibly harsh hit, how can I fix this promblem?!!!

aVi went ahead and googled phix for you and found your problem\u000a\u000a"There was some moisture on the inside of my PHIX pod pack. What should I do?"\u000aPHIX pods subject to excessive humidity or a drastic altitude change (like flying on a plane) may experience a minor amount of condensation or leakage. If your PHIX pod leaks, it's best to avoid direct contact with the liquid, but if you get liquid on your hands simply wash with soap and water. You may continue to use a PHIX pod if some liquid has escaped, but carefully wipe the juice off with a clean cloth or tissue before inserting into your device. If leaking persists, please contact the PHIX Care team.

aVPhlegm Buildup When Vaping - SOS\u000a\u000aHey guys.\u000a\u000aSo recently, rather than a mod, I've been using a Twelve Juno, a high nicotine, easy to hide vape stick, and now I'm using a Phix by MLV. The Juno was 36 mg, and the Phix is 50. \u000a\u000aI'm writing this today because a few of my friends and I are worried about a certain phlegm buildup in our throats recently. Ever since I've started vaping (even before my Juno, I had a tiny Smok mod), I've always been spitting out phlegm from the top of my throat; this hasn't happened before in my life. I've never smoked a cigarette, occasionally I'll smoke weed (barely), and I've smoked cigars twice. I want to continue vaping, but this phlegm buildup is really worrying me; could the vapor be building up in my lungs, and then I'm coughing it out? If so, I'm guessing that if the vapor burns my tongue upon touch, it's not so good for my lungs? \u000a\u000aI'm just really worried. I don't want to have to deal with this later in life, and that's why I'm just paranoid and shit right now. Hopefully someone could help me out and give me some answers.\u000a\u000aThanks guys.\u000a

aVI would suggest getting a quick cigalike (juul, phix, cync, myjet, icare) with 25-50mg salt NIC juices.\u000a\u000aHits the cravings dead on when your really wanting to pick up a cancer stick

aVQuestions about the phix\u000a\u000aI'm not really sure if this is the right way to go about this or if I'm even in the place. I've recently purchased a Phix by MLV, and as of late it's started to act up. I'll do my best to try and describe my issues; to start each one my pods tastes like Battery, I've tried three different pods. I don't know if it's also part of the problem but instead of the silent hits the Phix makes a loud crackling sound. I still get hits and the regular buzz, but it just tastes like goddamn battery. Any solutions or info?
p78
aVNice! I'm thinking of getting a phix but the icare is super cheap! However the phix has way more nicotine so I'm on the fence 
p79
aVThe phix needs more flavors...\u000a\u000aSo I just got the phix. I love it so far and I got spearmint. It sucks kinda.. It's vapeable but not that good. I'm gonna go buy ICE and strawberry but come on MLV make some more flavors.. Other pod based systems have a crap ton of flavors. Anyone else agree with me on this? 
p80
aVMods from left to right; wimsec rx200, geek vape karma kit, phix. \u000aJuices; artic blast and green apple. From vapejoose.com\u000aDon't judge me for my phix it's for when I'm at work. We have a smoking room and I can't\u200b have clouds
p81
aVJuul or Phix?\u000a\u000aWhich do you guys prefer and why?
p82
aVI didn't like any of the Phix flavors. While I do like three of the JUUL flavors.
p83
aVPhix.. because it's easier to find pods.
p84
aVI would say a phix or a juul but they both take pods\u000aTry the emili vape kit it is what I started with it works great there is an option to choose a button or non button 
p85
aVMy friend just bought a phix
p86
aVUse the phix or an I care mini with high nic there is some mr salty e liquid that delivers real high nic I have tried it on 45 mg and it hits your system quick and will adjust your cravings, with the I care , the phix is a pod system and I think it goes to 50 mg , I use big tanks and create huge amounts of vapour on high watts but for being discreet and getting the hit use one of the above

aVVape Mail ! Phix by MLV
p88
aVPhix by Mlv is closed loop system similar to juul but i heard really good things about it so i decided to test it out let me know if any of you guys are familiar with this device if so let me know what you think of it !
p89
aVThere's going to be a ton of devices that will be releasing soon so you shouldn't worry about it.  What's current on the market are:\u000aJuul\u000aMyjet\u000aVon Erl\u000aPhix\u000aBo\u000aFITT\u000aThese are your options, my preference would be Juul, Myjets &amp; Von Erl.  I find these pretty easy to use, and delivery for all is great!  Von Erl &amp; Myjet is cost friendly so you don't have to spend much.  More money you save on a device so you can spend it on the liquid!  Research them to see which would best fit you. Spend sometime researching on liquid tho, I would definitely look into something with Nicotine Salt because it goes best with these devices.

aVPHIX! Thought the Pax Juul was good? This thing is ten times better.\u000a\u000a[deleted]
p91
aVwould you consider making one for the PHIX? ... LV Damier Ebene pattern, perhaps? :\u2019) 
p92
aVI would look into the Mipod by Smoking Vapors,  they have a great warranty system and the Mipods themselves come in numerous different color options, they come with lanyards and keychain attachments, refillable pods that are good for about five full ups. They\u2019re very small and portable salt nicotine devices that give you the option to go tradition tobacco flavorings or to try new flavors. Buying a bottle of salt nicotine vs juul pods ends up being much cheaper in the long run. 30ml bottles of salt nicotine juices retail for about $20 bucks in my local shops(including the one I work at) with the pods selling for just under $5. Juul pods around me range from $15-20 for 4 pods. You get 7.5 ml of juice in every 4 pod pack compared to a bottle of salt nicotine juice costing you $20 for 30ml. So it\u2019s about $100 to get the same of amount of eliquid as a regular 30ml bottle of juice. If prefilled pod systems are your go to the PHIX might be another viable option for you as well.

aVPutting pod juice in a refill system?\u000a\u000aMy phix recently broke and now I have a bunch of unused pods that I cant use with my suorin air. Is there anything stopping me from opening up a pod and filling my air with it? I know it's different from most ejuices but is is still doable?
p94
aVIt's pretty decent imo, bigger capacity than juul and airflow not as restricted. At 2.4% nicotine they give a way better throat-hit than juul 3% pods. Their tobacco pod that went with the kit also taste better than juul tobacco pods, nice honey caramel taste. If Blu gonna be serious about this device, I can easily see it would take phix's position as juul biggest rival.
p95
aVThanks for the suggestions, side note, I went in today and their prices are INSANE 20$ for juul pods 28$ for phix 32$ for jam monster, the guys only selling inflated prices to kids it\u2019s right next to a bar that regularly has younger smokers/vapers and I never see anyone but kids go in there cause the prices are crazy
p96
aVJuul flavors have been taken from stores and Distros entirely. I work for one. Last week we got our last stock to the vape shops. They are no longer available. So you cannot purchase any pods from brick and mortar locations.\u000a\u000aJuul has also won a patent case. Meaning Phix, and other pod systems like it habe been sued and received a cease and desist order. This has put any company making a Juul shaped device under duress.\u000a\u000aYou can only obtain Juul Pods from their website, after age verification.
p97
aVHometown hero makes 20mg (also infzn by Brewell mfg, the guys who make the phix. They make an 18mg) other than that you\u2019d have to look at companies like cloudberryvapors or elite elixirs, which the juice is made upon request.\u000aI feel the same though, U.S juice companies should make 20mg 
p98
aVI'll let you decide if any of these are fast/easy but search for "youtube refill mark ten elite podss" gives lots of results.\u000a\u000aSearch for "youtube refill phix pods" also gives lots of results.\u000a\u000aSome say the Phix and Elite are not the same even though they look identical. IDK, don't have either one, just couldn't let this post go unanswered.
p99
aVI do! I basically haven't touched any of my other vapes since getting the Alto. It has the smoothest, quietest, and most satisfying out of all the pod systems I've tried (Juul, Phix, Myle, plus various refillables). I use the mixed fruit pods which aren't the greatest tasting (Phix blue raspberry gets that accolade), but it's a fair trade off. Love my Alto. 
p100
aVI picked up a novo recently. I was a steady juul guy and I bought other pod devices in the past (breeze 2, phix) which I hated. The novo has been very solid in my replacement for the juul since it\u2019s so similar. I\u2019d recommend 
p101
aVMy sister uses a Phix and she loves it. she said the only good flavors are hard strawberry and blue raspberry. 
p102
aVKwit Stick is my favorite and I have tried many. Fair warning, the tobacco flavor is trash and always prime the pod after refill, if you don't then it burns the wick and ruins the pod, I'm currently getting 6+ refills per pod. Other than that the hits are strong and consistent, no leaks, FAST charging and its cheap to use. They give you 10% off your first order and frequently send you emails for 10% coupon codes if you buy from their site rather than a wholesaler. They screwed up my order once but sent the missing item same day with no questions asked. Highly recommended over Juul, Ziip, Phix, Fit, Inifinix, Drop, and myBlu.
