VOk. So you're using a topical? Some sort of CBD cream or lotion? If ingesting or smoking weed helps you. Then, try smoking or eating the CBD. There is CBD flower, that looks like really bad weed, that you can smoke and has zero thc. There is also CBD distillate and isolate you can put in a vape pen and smoke. Finally there is cbd vape juice you can put in a juul or mod battery. As for edibles, there are the same type of options as edible weed. There are also tinctures that have up to 5000mg of CBD. You can mix it in a drink or just drop on your tongue. \u000a\u000aI'm not a big fan of topicals for pain relief. Especially if ingesting or smoking weed helps. First of all, topicals are usually pretty low dosage. So you're not getting much cbd per application. 2nd, eating and smoking gets the cbd into your system, way faster and isn't as much of a time release as topicals. More of an punch of relief all at once. \u000a\u000aI'm telling you. The THC isn't what's helping. You may be enjoying the feelings of euphoria. But it's not what is relieving your pain.

aVI hope not. I havent used my juul at all yesterday or today since i took the detox. Ive been wanting to use it but I\u2019ve been afraid it\u2019ll mess up the whole process 
p7
aVI decided to leave my dab cartridge at home, didnt wanna risk it. brought my juul even though i told myself i was gonna quit...oh well, a 12 day trip to europe isn't the best time to kick nicotine. 
p8
aVI don\u2019t chew or smoke cigs there ass juul is way better \U0001f644 but anyways yea it\u2019s is my choice which I choose to use young, oh well short and fun life over long and boring, of course I am smart about what I do and how often I do them. as far as age I\u2019m 18 and the legal age to use tobacco is 21 and I\u2019m from Oregon if that helps at all. I searched high an low but couldn\u2019t find any information on wether they surprise test so I\u2019m honestly assuming they don\u2019t but if you happen to know other wise that would be great and I\u2019ll drop everything. And as far as smoking weed goes I don\u2019t fuck with that rn to much of a pain in my ass to find the right timing to do that shit, and it\u2019s even harder to get out of my system fast enough.
p9
aV^^^true shit well I\u2019ll keep my nose clean for the most part I might dabble like once or twice with drugs but not gonna even get back into my old ways. So much wrong with what I did before \U0001f644. Thanks for the advise tho gonna stay clean and I actually decided I\u2019m selling my juul now so all gonna be good \U0001f64f
