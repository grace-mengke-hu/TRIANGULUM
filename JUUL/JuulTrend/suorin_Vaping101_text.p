VBuying suorin sur soon, need help with e-juice
p1
aVHey I just found a review of the suorin that stated the following:\u000a\u000a "The manufacturer recommends that either 60/40 VG/PG or 70/30 eliquids are used in order to avoid leaking, and they even include an information card inside the box informing you of this, however I have had 18mg Digbys Apple and Cinnamon in there just fine with no leaking issues, and that has a 50/50 mix ratio."\u000a\u000aSo I guess I can use 50/50 or possibly 60/40VG to stay on the safe side of things, right?

aVPLEASE help! Brand new Suorin Drop doesn\u2019t work.

aVSuorin Drop vs VooPoo Panda?

aVAll of the devices here are sub par pod systems with the exception of the Juul.. I only say that because it works but is extremely expensive for most users.. The way they describe Smok products is complete and utter BS.. Same goes for Sourin. I'm not saying I have all the knowledge of pod systems but I have enough to know there are FAR better systems that should've made this list.  These wouldn't have even made my top 20.        It almost seems like they paid to have these on here given how ludacris this list is... I would recommend the Innokin EQ, The MI-pod or The Smoant S8.. Those are my top three and either one of them will serve you well, My Friend.

aVGreat write-up! I\u2019ve never bought a Juul for this very reason. I always try to tell my friends how much cheaper it is, but maybe they\u2019re just too lazy to fill it up or try something new. I\u2019m currently using the sourin air and it\u2019s just as satisfying as the Juul imo

aVI would recommend a pod based device, something like a suorin drop or vaporesso renova zero, you can check out some devices on [VaporOrigin.com](https://VaporOrigin.com) The site is easy to use and has all sorts of pod devices, smokers tend to like a throat hit and with a nicotine salt of 35mg to 50mg she'll be super happy! \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aHappy Thanksgiving!
