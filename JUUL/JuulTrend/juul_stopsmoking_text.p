VGet a juul you'll thank me later
p1
aVSome of my friends have been using this e-cigarette called juul,  I figured that I may be tempted to try that.  If I tell them I quit they'll be respectful,  of that I'm sure.  I'll definitely take it easy on the drinks, I'll probably come back to this post during my time there.  
p2
aVDay two using the new Juul vape from Pax
p3
aVI wouldn't use the word cheap, but it's very lightweight (weighs less than a BIC lighter) and if you really wanted to you could probably break it in half. I like it because it fits in my jean pocket and even in the little key pocket in my workout pants. I've already stepped on it once or twice and it's fine. Most of it is the battery anyway.\u000a\u000aI'll admit I've gotten some weird looks because pretty much every ecig either looks like a cigarette or it's one of those big tubey contraptions. The Juul looks more like something you'd use to smoke weed (though I live in San Francisco so most people ignore that anyway).\u000a\u000aI'm still going strong today. So far it's been well worth the $50 for the vape and the cartridges.
p4
aVYeah for me I've quit smoking more times than I can count, and now it's only been 3 days without a cigarette but the juul hit the spot whenever I have a craving. I really do enjoy it more than other e cigarettes I have tried. (Blu, enjoy, anything else you pickup at a gas station). Hopefully this will help me kick it for good this time. 
p5
aVGood on you for quitting, if you're picking up an E-cig then I'd get a Juul.  I've tried everything and most ecigs just make me go back to smoking.  The juul gives me the same buzz I got from when I started smoking.  
p6
aVI started vaping, and will be moving to no nicotine soon. I had smoked for 23 years and tried everything to quit and couldn't. My friend bought me a juul and I started to wean myself off cigarettes that way. It's been 4 months and so many benefits have kicked in. At first it was nice to walk down the street and not be an inconvenience to others while smoking, not smell like smoke all the time. Now it just started raining and I'm so excited that I don't need to go through the whole winter smoker hassles of standing in the cold and rain, etc. If you cant find yourself quitting with other methods, I would check out the juul. It's small, is satisfying, feels good in your hand, and doesn't do the big cloudy thing. I also got a bunch of apps like Kwit and MyLastCigarette so I could track how many cigarettes I haven't smoked. I'm at about 2,200 now. My goal is no nicotine, but I am okay with using this as a stepping stone since it allowed me to see how impactful the benefits of not smoking can be.
p7
aVI don't know your views on e-cigarettes as a cessation tool, but I was in the same boat - alcohol was too powerful a trigger, so every time I drank, I'd smoke. Didn't want to stop drinking, so I bought a Juul e-cig and never looked back. My badge is busted, but my wife and I just celebrated one month tobacco-free and we've been drinking/partying as much as we want.\u000a\u000aIf e-cigs are "cheating" to you (or you don't want to substitute tobacco for vaping), you might have to lay off the drinks until your confidence/willpower improves. If not, I'd strongly recommend vaping when you drink. \u000a\u000aGood luck!
p8
aVI quit on Sunday. I am using a JUUL, so I am definitely not needing nicotine like I did when I quit cold turkey in 2011, but here is some stuff that worked/is working for me for the behavioral part on my addiction:\u000a\u000a\u2022Every time I want a cigarette (a real one, in this case) I literally out run the craving. Because I ran, I feel good about myself *and* I get a sweet, sweet endorphin rush. Running is my go-to replacement behavior, since it fills a lot of the same need in me that smoking does.\u000a\u2022I downloaded a quit smoking app called "Smoke Free". It's a free app that gives you missions (for a one time $4.99 payment) and free enforcement for not smoking. It tells you how much money you have saved, how many days of your life you got back, and gives good encouragement. I feel good when I look at it, as if every minute I'm not smoking I am winning.\u000a\u2022My car is a huge trigger for me, so today I detailed it. I put a lot of effort into it, and it smells pretty good. That's a good feeling. Also, I smell pretty good. Also a good feeling.\u000a\u000aGood luck! You can do this.
p9
aVWhat do you guys think of vape products and cigarette substitutes like the juul. Need opinions. Comments are appreciated!
p10
aVTrying to quit the juul
p11
aVI think you might be better off just refilling the Juul Pods with Non-Nic juice.
p12
aVI figured since Juul doesn't make non-nic juice that wasn't going to be feasible.  I'll look into it.
p13
aVCongratulations! I\u2019ve been vaping &amp; not smoking cigs, but I feel like I am vaping way more than I was smoking - easier to conceal! Quit date set for 12/31, but maybe I should just throw Juul away today. 
p14
aVThose juuls have the highest concentration of nicotine of any other nrt or tobacco product. Toss it as soon as possible. 
p15
aVJuul fiend
p16
aVI'm replying with the benefit of seeing other comments and your replies.\u000a\u000aNicotine addiction has a physical side and a mental side.  Both are serious; both need to be overcome.  Since you can go days without your addiction is like 90% mental.   Don't discount the risk of that.  I smoked only on weekends when I was out for at least a year.  Then I was so addicted, I smoked for twenty years hating myself for it.  It sneaks up on you. \u000a\u000a&gt; any advice?\u000a\u000aRead [this chapter of an e-book (pdf)](http://whyquit.com/FFN/chapters/FFN_11_Subconscious.pdf).   It is about how nicotine is working it's addiction magic even now.  Hopefully it will help your conscious mind realize why any nicotine is too much.\u000a\u000aYou might try getting a zero nicotine vape.  I found the breathing ritual (puff, hold, long exhale) kind of soothing.  I think the JUUL is a nicotine addiction device:  it has no way to control the nicotine level.\u000a\u000aNow is a great time to be quitting.  I wish I had quit as early as you.\u000a\u000a\u000a
p17
aVJuul addiction
p18
aVI\u2019m hooked on these things too! It\u2019s been a blessing and a curse. On one hand it\u2019s great not smoking a pack of stinking tar filled cigarettes a day. On the other, I find myself using these things ALL THE TIME. \u000a\u000aI\u2019m hooked just as bad as I was on cigarettes but I keep telling myself at least it\u2019s not as bad for me. Prior to this I was using a \u201ccompact\u201d sub ohm vape which I found annoying to maintain, way more bulky to carry, and not nearly as satisfying. I\u2019m convinced these juuls are the best harm reduction strategy I\u2019ve got right now but I recognize that I\u2019m a slave to them and know that I need to stop what I\u2019m doing to myself.\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve been working on mentally preparing for my next quit attempt. I\u2019m way more mindful of how I feel after not having used and understand that the anxiety during withdrawal is a product of the addiction. For my next attempt I\u2019m going to avoid nicotine replacement since that seems to just prolong the suffering, Chantix because it makes me kind of insane, and just let my brain heal on its own cold turkey. It\u2019s going to suck for a little while but I think that\u2019s probably the quickest way through.
p19
aVHey I am in the kinda same boat as you are, I'm done smoking cigarettes but the next step would to get off of using the juul as well. I had two juuls and used them for about three months before I decided to give it up and go cold turkey this weekend. It's tough but I know I can pull through. A small suggestion from a friend was to taper off the juul, but I don't see how you can as PAX labs only sells 5% nic pods. I suggest that you try diluting your pods with a 0 nicotine juice so you would be getting less nic. Like maybe use two pods until halfway then fill the rest up with 0 mic juice. The throat hit probably won't be the same, but there will still be nic. I quit using the juul because my throat would be sore all the time, and cutting it cold turkey would help me the most. Last thursday I woke up with the worst pain in my throat, it was a common occurrence like every other week, but this was the worst. If you have trouble on refilling pods/diluting them, give it a google, it's fairly easy and you can get a couple extra uses out of those pods. I've been off the juul and vapes since sunday and my throat still feels horrible. Good luck to you and OP! You can do this!
p20
aVDude fucking dump the juul asap. I started smoking it around august and it was actually causing me to have mild panic attacks. Eventually I picked up a full blown addiction at 1-1.5 pods a day. The panic attacks were so bad that I had to get an ekg to make sure I didn't have atrial fibrillation. I quit cold turkey right before thanksgiving and man it was tough but I left it back at school while I was home so that helped and once I passed through the first week of withdrawal it started getting better.\u000a\u000aI'm serious when I say this: get rid of it now.
p21
aVi literally flushed my juul down the toilet about a week ago. The withdrawal symptoms are hell right now, but its slowly getting better. trust me after the third or fourth day it slowly starts getting better
p22
aVI\u2019ve heard about the vapes. Are they better for you? I know they aren\u2019t necessarily \u201cgood\u201d for you because our lungs aren\u2019t meant for anything besides oxygen. But I\ufe0fm considering getting the \u201cjuul\u201d vape because it\u2019s so tiny. My friend has one and i really enjoy hitting I\u200et because it\u2019s small enough to feel like a real cigarette. Also, what about starting out with nicotine, then going down on the mg, eventually getting to 0mg? 
p23
aVI Lost My Juul and I\u2019m Tempted to go buy a Phix
p24
aVHey bro, you're just like me. I'm 21 and I was also smoking since 13. I quit cigarettes 3 months ago and I quit the Juul 4 days ago. We got this mate!!! Don't give up!!!!
p25
aVSo I stopped smoking cigarettes for 2 days but I caved in and bought a Juul, is this habit just as bad as smoking? Many sources say it's not bad for you but I feel like it is. Any advise?
p26
aVI like to think it is not as bad as smoking but my problem with the Juul specifically was the high nicotine content. It was great first thing in the morning to buzz right outta bed with it. but I started to get concerned about the high nicotine levels so I eventually went back to cigs thinking they were better because the nicotine content was lower (not smart). When I quit smoking again (currently at over a month now) I went with an e cig that has differences in nicotine strength so I can step myself down to nothing eventually. 
p27
aVOpinions on Juul for quitting cigarettes
p28
aVI just quit last week, first time i have ever given it a real shot and i have been smoking a pack a day for about 20 years.  Yesterday was the first time i have not had 1 cig the whole day.  I am chain using my Juul however.  That said it has been the only device i have found that works as a replacement.  I even find im fine using it while drinking instead of analogs.
p29
aVActually there is a huge difference in the case of the juul. It is much more cigarette like in its buzz, normal e cigs have freebased nicotine while the juul uses a mix of salt based nicotine mixed with benzoic acid derived from tobacco which makes the buzz hit you 20 times faster than traditional e cigs but wears off faster. \u000a\u000aAll in all it is bad since it would make you more addicted to nicotine. 
p30
aVPractice with  JUUL.
p31
aVI wanted to quit smoking and chewing tobacco,  i bought a JUUL vape, one of the highest nicotine containing vapes out there, and i really like it. If you suck on it long enough, you will buzz, however i am so inundated with nicotine that it essentially keepa nicotine levels in my plasma up, reducing the urge to smoke. If your method is not working, i would suggest a JUUL because i think it is one of the better investments i have made in my life. (21M, average nicotine consumption of 1.5 juul pods a day or around 62mg of nicotone a day)
p32
aVBe careful, juul has a lot of nicotine. I went down the same path and found myself using 2 cartridges a day.\u000a \u000aSave yourself the trouble a smash it into the pavement like I did. 
p33
aVAre you still doing herbs with your hasj? Would you recommend it? I am not smoking cigs, but did start to vap w/ Juul again, which as you know has the nicotine. Planning to quit vaping 12/31 \U0001f49c
p34
aVThank you! You can do it!!! You'll need a bit of will power but don't do it until you feel ready. I bought a nicotine replacement, the Juul vape which has a low percent but really helps when you have cravings. I think it was a good transition for me but everyone is different. Best of luck to you! 
p35
aVNicotine replacement helps for some people. I\u2019ve got almost 3 weeks with the help of a Juul vape. It\u2019s surprisingly close to smoking a cigarette without the awful side affects (stinky, bad for you ect) I was never able to quit because I have like zero self control. When I see my friends smoking, I feel left out if I\u2019m not smoking too.  I can still be included in the smokers circle without actually having to light up! Something to think about. It may work for you too!
p36
aVTry the juul or ephix. They use a different type of nicotine. Which, is a nicotine salt and binds much more like an actual cigarette does to receptor sites. I like the ephix more simply because it feels sturdier and holds more juice. 
p37
aVI've seen good reviews about Juul on the e-cig subs as well. I'll give that brand a shot first since there is a local convenience store that carries it.\u000a\u000aThanks for the tip!
p38
aVI highly recommend the juul, much stronger than the typical blu ecigs, and a couple more flavors as well. I quit starting with a vape mod, bulky and always refilling juices, it wasn't strong enough in nicotine so I went back to cigs a couple times. But after I got the juul, my cravings for cigarettes are basically gone. What's better is that I used a pod (juul cartridge) a day and now I go through one every 2-3 days. And it's been about three weeks. \u000aYou may be able to find one at your local head shop but I suggest getting one online if that doesn't work out. \u000a\u000aGood luck! You got this!\u000a
p39
aVPAX JUUL helped me quit. First few weeks I smoked it a lot but it was much easier to quit than the cigarettes, and once your brain dissociates the taste and routine of the cigarettes with the nicotine, I\u2019ve found I don\u2019t even find them appealing anymore. Smoke the JUUL from time to time especially if I drink, but much better than the cigarettes. 
p40
aVHello my vaping replacement friend! I have a Juul and a vape pen. I'm 4w 3d cig free. Keep up the good work!
p41
aVI made it 4 weeks as of yesterday. I did it through vaping as a replacement. I have a pen and a Juul. I'm going to reduce the nicotine in my juice every time I need a new bottle, but the Juul can't lower the levels. I'm so fucking proud of myself for finding a way to quit cigarettes!
p42
aVYou go! The juul helps me a lot although I still have the occasional cigarette. I need to cut it out though I end up regretting smoking them every time. 
p43
aVIt's a god damn beast. I like my Juul, but I hate that it doesn't come with lower nicotine cartridges. I'm going to have to give that one up at some point
p44
aVVape, specifically a Juul, they are 34.99 now. You just need someone who is 21+ to order you one... or a vape... start at 12 mg... you really get a nice throat hit
p45
aVI still vape after quitting but now I don't use a big mod. I use a juul. It's very satisfying and I don't feel all clogged up like I did with smoking
p46
aVI have, went from pack and half a day to using the Juul ecig for 3-4weeks, was planning on switching to nicotine gum after but didn't think it was necessary and stopped after 3-4 peices. This was about 6 months ago.\u000a\u000aPeople love to say it's impossible because they couldn't do it. Prove them wrong.
p47
aVThe logic pro kit is $35 and then you can get a 3 pack of cherry cartridges for $9-$14 depending on the store.  They don't make nicotine free though. \u000a\u000aAnother pen type ecig that is reasonably priced is the Juul and they have sweet flavors like mango. I do not know if they make a nicotine free one though. \u000a\u000aIf you are willing to buy online Halo is a company that makes e-juice with no nicotine and they have several inexpensive options https://www.halocigs.com/e-liquid/
p48
aVMy friends and I are all really addicted to these mini e-ciggs called juuls. I was the first one out of my group of friends who was able to be able to quit. After using the the app to motivate me,all 5 of my friends are following in my footsteps. We destroyed $250 worth of juuls on a trail yesterday
p49
aVGet a juul to help quit. Not unhealthy unless you take in ridiculous amounts of nicotine (bad for the heart) and will stop a lot of the cravings
p50
aVYep, it sure does - if you want it to.\u000a\u000aI've been tobacco-free for 203 days now, and I feel so much better. I switched to e-cigs right as I quit tobacco (first the Juul, now the Von Erl), and I don't regret it in the slightest. \u000a\u000aYes, e-cigs often have more nicotine, and some purists might not think it "counts" because you're still consuming nicotine, but fuck that noise. E-cigs, to me, are a totally viable quitting aid, and you're better off vaping than smoking tobacco cigarettes. Keep going!
p51
aVYou should check out www.juulvapor.com\u000a\u000aI haven't touched a cigarette in 3 months since I bought this thing. Basically, it's an e-cigarette that uses disposable, high-nicotine leveled cartridges. The juice in them is composed of nicotine salts, rather than the freebase nicotine found in most, if not all, e-juices nowadays. This makes the buzz, throat hit, and vapor production feel much more like a cigarette draw.\u000a\u000aFrom the website:\u000a&gt;"JUUL uses nicotine salts that are found in the tobacco leaf, rather than free-base nicotine, and is designed to produce consistent, quality vapor." ; "Nicotine content: 0.7mL with 5% nicotine by weight (59 mg/mL per pod, ~ content of a pack of cigarettes)."\u000a\u000aAs of right now, they come in mint, fruit, tobacco, mango, and creme brulé flavors; a lot of new flavors and lower nicotine levels are expected to be released soon. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNow, the thing about these devices is that they are quite addictive and the fact that they produce low amounts of vapor allows them to be used pretty much anywhere, I try to not go over a pod every 2 days, but sometimes I go 1 a day which is like smoking a pack a day...\u000a\u000aSo yeah, mixed feelings about it, but I can vouch for how effective it is for quitting cigs.
p52
aVYeah I'm more looking for something that is gonna help me quit smoking entirely not just replace cigarettes. With the oils I can reduce the amount of nicotine intake so hopefully I don't smoke anything. If juul does release lower nicotine options maybe it's something worth trying. Thanks for showing me them though, never heard of it before.  
p53
aVWhat did it for me was finding an ecig with the right kind of throat hit.  The first couple ecigs were comparable to hookahs.  Those just made me want to smoke cigarettes.  The last one, which helped me quit, had the right throat hit to help me replace cigarettes.  Juul is the brand.  There are some other brands in the same category.  Im sure the vape subredit has more info on them.    
p54
aVAnyone have experience quitting the juul?
p55
aVTo clarify a bit: Do you hate the e-cig because it's messing with your erections, because of the flavor, or because you've got it locked in a box and can only occasionally access it?\u000a\u000aAs for the erections, I have only anecdotal evidence from personal experience: My erections are so hard to the point of almost painful when I am using an e-cig instead of smoking, whereas when I am smoking I have difficulty keeping it up.\u000a\u000aAs for flavor: I work in a vape/tobacco shop and the people who have the best success switching from smoking to vaping are those that find flavors they love. Making the e-cig MORE desirable than having a cigarette is definitely a key part to quitting smoking with one. Try other flavors from Juul, or hit up a vape shop, find juice you like, pop open an empty pod with a bobby pin, and fill it yourself. Experimenting with the flavors and finding YOUR flavor of choice is what will help make the quit successful.\u000a\u000aAs for the locked box: what length is the timer? Can you bypass the timer to access it if you get a particularly intense craving?\u000a\u000aIf the issue is mainly with the flavor and you haven't found a Juul juice that you enjoy, you may have better luck using a different device that has a larger variety. The "My Von Erl" would be my next recommendation, followed by the Cync, then the MyJet.
p56
aVI stayed on the same nicotine cause I was using the juul ecig which only has the one level. It wasn't really planned to stop on day 30 but it started by thinking how long can I go and quickly realized I wasn't craving it. There's no need to rush and vaping is already a huge improvement just remember that it's a tool to use while quitting not a permanent alternative.
p57
aVI switched to vaping to quick analog cigs just over four months ago, and experienced something similar (though I too have a preexisting anxiety condition, which had something to do with it).\u000a\u000aFor me, it took a while to find the right unit and the right juice (at the right strength). I started with the Juul cigalike, which I enjoyed but finding the pods was just too much hassle. I switched to the My Von Erl, and love it. I use the Frisco Vapor juice pods (way better range of flavors) at either 18mg or 24mg, and typically only need around three or four hits to feel satisfied. If I took 10-15 hits as I would on an analog cigarette, I'd probably have a bad time.\u000a\u000aDon't give up. I've found vaping to be indispensable as a quitting tool, especially while I was still drinking (one of my worst smoking triggers). I'd recommend experimenting with different strengths of juice as well as how many hits you need to feel good. You'll soon adapt to how the nicotine juice affects you.\u000a\u000aAnd yes, definitely pay close attention to your dietary changes. Smoking is an appetite suppressant, so be sure to listen to what your body is telling you. Personally, I've had to be much more focused on eating enough and staying hydrated since I quit analogs. \u000a\u000aGood luck!
p58
aVIs smoking a Juul a good alternative/good way to start quitting?
p59
aVChantix is helping me.... I dont know what a juul is,  all I know is for me,  smoking anything isnt an option been there done that... I needed a nicotine free approach to quitting.... I found that prolonging my withdrawl with NRT was making it worse for longer and i always would relapse. 
p60
aVIt's working for me. I used the lozenges for the first month, then picked up a SMOK for when I was out, now I have a Juul. I'm five months in and still going strong. Only advice I'd offer is keeping the Juul far away from you while you're at home/work/anywhere you wouldn't normally be smoking. It's SUPER easy to slide into a new habit with something so convenient.
p61
aVDont smoke those juuls/nicotine alot vapes. They're terrible. Literally a little crack stick you can use anywhere.\u000a Almost worse than smoking..my personal advice
p62
aVThe Juul devices are kind of crap--i'd advise a SMOK device or something similar--essentially, anything you can get at a gas station is almost designed to suck and get you back on the cigs.\u000aVaping is leaps and bounds better than the cigs--the trick is finding a setup that works for you.   \u000aThat said, if you can just quit cold turkey, no vaping, no smoking.....well, good for you, and do that.    Go to a vape shop, and get something that allows for a variable nicotine content--a six or a twelve mg juice at first, and adjust higher or lower based on your level of satisfaction with it. \u000aFrom there, you can titrate it down to lower nicotine levels if you wish.   Down to zero, even. 
p63
aVI smoke a Juul, it\u2019s just a pacifier my friend lol.\u000a
p64
aVThey're better than Juul, though.  
p65
aVJuuled for the past 4 years every day
p66
aVThe problem with juuls which I think you have seen especially in American, is that they are soooo strong. The addiction is terrible with them. I think maybe going to a vape and getting a lower dose of nicotine then going no nicotine and then finally into nothing.
p67
aVGet something that allows you to titrate the nicotine content of the juice you're using.   Slowly switch to a juice that's lower in nicotine...they do make zero nic juices--Juuls and Blues are seemingly designed to suck.\u000a
p68
aVDamn, fucking cigarettes eh... I'm struggling with going a week; crazy that after a year the mind still craves them. I guess they're an easy crutch that the mind remembers.\u000a\u000aYou've done it once, time to do it again homie. This time for good! Have you ever vaped? I'm just asking because if you ever do come back on this path - maybe grab a juul or high nic salt pod device. I find them a lot easier to quit than after a week of cigarettes. Cheers! Best of luck. \U0001f340\U0001f37b
p69
aVAfter two months in the hospital and being forced to quit , when I tried it again, I didn\u2019t like it.  But I still like nicotine duh. So I\u2019ve just been using a Juul like the millennial I am.  But yeah I\u2019m the car is definitely the hardest.   
p70
aVNo problem at all. I have just become a nonsmoker. It is the single best thing I've ever done for myself! It will be the best thing you do, too.\u000a\u000aI understand the impulse to shy away from MORE cigarettes. I felt so weird by that point in the book, taking one more puff. I used a Juul, so not a cigarette. It was my addiction at the time. I think it will have less impact for you. It's about feeling the sensations and making concrete, the feeling that this is not what you want. \u000a\u000aPlease, please, please read the book. And do it today. \u000a\u000aCongratulations on 48 hours! You are seriously ONLY 3 days from being free of ANY physical symptoms. Let me know if there is any way I can help you, any information I can pass along -- how to deal with certain aspects, why stuff happens. I'm not an expert, I'm just a guy who managed to quit smoking. You need to do this, and you need to do it for good. \u000a\u000a
p71
aVI\u2019m in the same boat right now! I\u2019ve had a history of asthma/sinusitis and have had that combo for about 2 weeks. Switched from dipping to a Juul over the summer and the Juul was killing my congestion and lungs. Decided I\u2019d just stop since I didn\u2019t like it anymore anyway, 4 days down!
p72
aVI use a Juul, it made quitting much easier. I\u2019m going to step down to 3% in a few weeks, then nothing. I quit about three weeks ago, tried to smoke about a week in and threw it out three puffs in, I couldn\u2019t stop coughing and hated the smell. Drove home reeking of cigarettes but happy with the knowledge that I didn\u2019t want to smoke anymore.
p73
aVI agree with u/therealdannyking. Using nicotine now would be a step backwards. People report that stopping Juul is just as hard as quitting tobacco cigarettes.\u000a\u000aHave you been to [WhyQuit.com](http://whyquit.com/)? Watching Joel Spitzer videos about quitting really helped me. \u000a\u000aA craving won't kill you. You can handle it.

aVI\u2019d rather use a Juul in the same way someone would use the patch (didn\u2019t work for me) or nicotine gum (didn\u2019t work for me either) than smoke. I guess I\u2019m weak for not being able to go cold turkey but I\u2019m really enjoy my cigarette free life and cutting back on the Juul to eventually be nicotine free. \u000a\u000aIf cold turkey works for you, more power to ya. Didn\u2019t work for me. This does, downvote me all you want. I\u2019m just happy to not smell like smoke and be short of breath constantly. 
p75
aVI'm at 14 days. Used a juul so it's not quite as tough as cold Turkey. Good shit tho
p76
aVWhat is a juul? I don't know the term or product 
p77
aVHELP NEEDED, quit by Juuling and lost it on a trip.
p78
aVTry juul, I used mine to quit smoking
p79
aVI have a juul, two actually. But I couldn\u2019t get a good enough hit off it it without choking to death. I found a really good pod that uses the same nic salts and it kinda helps. 
p80
aVThanks again, man.  I know I should, but I had stepped down to 0 mg vape, same thing- I was super happy until 18 hrs later.  Then...bam.  Had to hit 30 mg nic salts or juul.  Im just kinda tired of being addicted man.  And the stupid thing is i put the vape away last night so i wouldnt use it today.
p81
aVGot a juul
p82
aVJUUL NO LONGER ABLE TO SELL FRUIT FLAVORS!?! FDA BAN!!!
p83
aV20 year old that is hoping to slow down on smoking my Juul and weed
p84
aVA pod a day = a pack a day, maybe start cutting down on the juul.  If you want good grades weed will not help.  
p85
aVImho Juuls are the new cigarette nikki trap; there's more nicotine per hit and a pod equates to roughly a pack. Tbh i switches from a juul  to a Smok Novo, that way the pods are refillable so i have 1.5%-0% nic juice as opposed to the ~28% (? Correct me if im wrong) ina juul pod.\u000a\u000a\u000aI wish nothing but the best for you. As far as the electric lettuce goes I've always been able to find success if using it *specifically* as a reward for completing any and all schoolwork. Sooner or later you'll get in the habit and it will feel like a nice little treat. Do know that at our age (i, too, am facing just about the same situation as you lmao), being under the influence of thc while either in class or studying, *noticeably* better for information retention in my experience.  \u000a\u000a\u000aBest of luck all around 
p86
aVI've had a few relapses this past month, I need to update my days. I'm on Day 3 after my brother visited with a juul, and stupidly I got pretty into it as he was, and promptly was craving cigarettes like mad. I dont know how I was so dumb, I promise you that feeling wont last and gets easier to overcome with each day. Granted some triggers really whollup you, cant stand those. Like you think back on that moment of the day constantly and the aftershocks of cravings after.\u000a\u000aBut oof, oh man, boy howdy, it is so not worth it. My most recent relapses were for the most blatant of reasons. I'd be craving, having a mood, and think "oh fuck it I need a good boost right now". And it was like, by the end of the cig I saw all the days I went go up in smoke. It's such a shit feeling instead of satisfying, AND the negative emotion usually sets off a feeling to smoke again (at least for me)\u000a\u000aAbsolutely fuck those things. Keep fighting the good fight, I'm happy you're growing beyond them too!
p87
aVTry juul or General snus, or both. They can pack a nic wallop that might help you make the initial step of getting away from the cigarette.  Juul is a high nicotine vape that uses salts that are closer to the way a cig delivers.  
p88
aVWhat are you vaping?  As in, a gas station e-cig, or a Juul, or something from a cape store!
p89
aVSomething called \u201cminifit\u201d , juul isn\u2019t sold in my country. \u000a\u000a\u000aHowever it came highly recommended, 4 of my friends quit using it. \u000a\u000aHowever I also have general flu like symptoms, is it probably due to the vape, quitting smoking or bad luck and I got sick?\u000a
p90
aVJuuling/ vaping?
p91
aVThank you for your comment. I bought a Juul 8 days ago, and haven't had a cigarette since. It's been a challenge, constantly being around those who smoke, and going through some pretty major life challenges at the moment, change of job, moved, and a divorce at the same time .. so I have plenty of "reasons" to smoke.\u000a\u000aI finally found the secret after many many attempts: you just gotta keep trying, something will eventually stick. For me, it was the Juul, which i've been doing for a week now. At first I was probably vaping more than I was smoking, but at least I wasn't smoking. Last night, I sat around and had a few beers in a smoky room, and my Juul was out. I could've charged it, but I didn't. I saw cigarettes on the table, I could've taken one, but they looked and smelled disgusting. I absolutely love how I don't smell now like an ashtray.\u000a\u000aJuul does contain nicotine, but for me, it's all those other chemicals (I feel like at least) in cigarettes that also keep you hooked. I'm down to very little vaping and only have a few pods left, after that I'm done. Cigarettes have zero appeal to me, I'm so glad I'm past them, and I know Juul has some negative side effects as well, so I'm looking forward to quitting that. One step at time.\u000a\u000aAs long as you are always fighting to make progress, keep fighting, you'll get there. It's just like anything else that you have to work at in life.
p92
aVI know a lot of people come here seeking help to get off the Juul. They say that going from cigarettes to the Juul made them more addicted to nicotine. In terms of stopping addiction,,,,, switching to Juul seems to be frying pan to the fire.
p93
aVIt didn\u2019t work for me either. The first two times. Now, a couple years later I\u2019m using the Juul and it\u2019s working out really well. I have two little boys so my motivation is sky high. I want to live for them as long as possible. I want to live for myself as long as possible. I love smoking cigarettes, but I have to be mature and recognize that I can either have my life or the cigarettes. This time around trying to Juul I took a big a drag to start and told myself how well it hit and how good it tasted. I think it\u2019s all your mindset and approach. 
p94
aVI have an addictive personality, gambling, smoking, video games were the big ones (also drinking back in high school but that just kinda ended in its own). It takes a shit ton of will power and determination. One at time is the way I went and now all I have left is cigarettes (currently 1 month smoke free). A distraction is defiantly needed I chose fitness. For video games I started with 10 pushups after every death/level and then 10 pushups and 1 chore(I.e. dishes, make the bed, etc). Now instead of video games for day 2 hours it\u2019s workout for 1 hour followed by gaming for an hour(if I have time). The busier you are the easier it is to not think about the addictions. Also I refuse to go to casinos anymore(still havnt found a good one for that) I too struggle with anxiety but as I\u2019ve gone through this journey I\u2019ve learned that these addictions are just a crutch that actually make the anxiety worse in the long run\u000a\u000aSide note I do juul so I\u2019m not nicotine free yet but it\u2019s a start
p95
aVJuul dude, I can\u2019t recommend enough. I was a pack a day for 3 years and after a few days of using a juul I don\u2019t even want to smoke cigarettes anymore
p96
aVThe thing is your still dependent on nicotine bro \u000a\u000aIf you were to stop juuling you would go through withdrawals, doesn\u2019t that bother you mate that you\u2019ve trading your addiction for somethin a little bit more healthy 
p97
aVI\u2019m 19 yrs old and I quit 25 days ago. My first three weeks were quite similar to yours. Super high hunger, sex drive, bad insomnia. For the insomnia buy some melatonin, it helps regulate your sleep cycle and puts you to bed (take about 30 minutes before you sleep). \u000a\u000aThe sex drive and hunger fix themselves with time, just limit yourself as best as possible but don\u2019t blame yourself if you overconsume, it takes enough willpower not to smoke already.\u000a\u000aYou might eventually notice yourself getting more paranoid or anxious, but that\u2019s just another part of your body normalizing after quitting. The dopamine release from smoking helps with stress, therefore when you remove that, it makes it harder to deal with things that stress you out.\u000a\u000aI had peppermint toothpicks in my mouth a lot just to satisfy the habit of putting a juul in my mouth. It helped me a lot, maybe it could help you. Doesn\u2019t hurt to try they\u2019re like 3 bucks for 100 lol.\u000a\u000afeel free to pm me if you have any other questions or anything 
p98
aVExperience with Juul?
p99
aVJust wanted to jump in so I could follow this conversation. I tried Vapes and they weren't for me, even the smaller pen shaped ones. Been thinking about trying a Juul to see if that works. 
p100
aVYeah, I'm a bit familiar with vapes in general but always found them so inconvinient because of their size and you had to refill them with juice and whatever, I just want to have a quick smoke when I have the urge to do so. I just ordered an overpriced Juul (they're hard to get here in the EU because of certain nicotine resteiction laws). I'll see how it goes. Every day I postpone buying one is \u20ac7,70 spent on a pack of cigarettes. It'll arrive next monday.
p101
aVAh I get quite a few days per refill on my vape, and it fits in my pocket- but I am considering buying a second much smaller one like a Juul or e-cigarette for times when I don\u2019t want to worry about the glass tank, or the bulky-ish mod.\u000a\u000aRegardless of what system you go for- I hope the vaping works for you! It\u2019s so nice not having to \u201cair out\u201d before talking to girls or whatever. And in Australia, a packet of Marlboro Reds cost nearly $40 AUD for a $25 pack if you buy it at a gas station instead of a supermarket.. I won\u2019t scare you by converting that to Euros but I\u2019ll just say this- you have it cheap over there..
p102
aVJuul helps you quit cigs but I found that I was even more hooked on that thing. If you just want to be done with cigs but don\u2019t mind being stuckon the nicotine still it\u2019s probably the best option.\u000a\u000aIt made me feel crazy though, I would hit it a few times when I got home and then I felt sick from the nicotine I think, would get a little headache and stomach upset. And then once that went away after 5 or 10 minutes I would grab the juul again. And repeat the process. Nicotine is a helluva drug. \u000a\u000aIt\u2019s probably not as bad as smoking, and  a bunch of my friends quit smoking and now only juul, but it just made me feel like I upgraded to cigs 2.0 and I didn\u2019t want to be a slave to any of it anymore.
p103
aVI concur w/ CrazyJo in that success is beating the addiction, not necessarily switching delivery mechanisms. \u000a\u000aThat said, I've found Juul (or vapes that use NicSalts) to be most like a hit from a cigarette - it is warm and mellow.  Problem with Juul is that it is 5mg's of Nicotine, which is very potent.  \u000a\u000aI used to smoke Juul's at work and cigarettes at home. Because Juul's are so potent it resolved my cigarette cravings, yet, over time it made me more addicted to Nicotine.  When I eventually quit cold turkey - in the office,  I craved the Juul as much as cigarettes (noting that I smoked for over 20 years - only smoking Juuls for the last 2!)         
p104
aVI have tried that too, you really need the right mindset for that. When I smoked the last cigarette of my pack and didn't buy a new pack (shops here close at 9pm, and city is a 15min drive) I was already stressing out after an hour of not smoking. When I'm at work I usually don't smoke for 4 hours before my break without much problem but just the thought that I didn't have any cigarettes left and that I will never get to smoke one again made me stress out so much faster. \u000a\u000aI think the Juul or any vape really can help a bit with that. I will receive it next monday. I will test it out, then put it away and I'll try to quit "cold turkey" but if the urge gets too big I will take the Juul instead of the cigarette.
p105
aVI used a juul for about 3 months before going cold turkey on all nicotine. I found it convenient and allowed me to have an in between stage. It's still nicotine, still addiction and all that. I did benefit from it though. 1 month completely free from nicotine! 
p106
aVI\u2019ve been using the juul for about a week. Still smoked a couple of cigarettes the first few days, but now have no desire to smoke a real cigarette even after a few drinks. The not smelling like smoke thing has really been positive reinforcement, since I was always self conscious of that. I like it. I\u2019m a little bothered that I\u2019m still hooked on nicotine but one step at a time is how I\u2019m looking at it
p107
aVYeah, I've been trying it for a bit now but to be honnest, if I don't smoke a single cigarette on a day, I smoke about 2,5 - 3 Juul pods which is still pretty expensive. So I bought some regular 50/50 E-Juice to refill them and that works, but I bought 12mg nicotine E-Juice and it's a bit too light in my throat (I'm not sure if that's because of the nicotine, I'll buy some 18mg soon and try that out) but I'm not really clear on how much nicotine these Juul pods contain because it says 3% or 6% and regular E-Juice displays it as mg's 3, 6, 12 or 18mg. Not sure which would be the equivalent of 6mg, definitely not the 6mg one.
p108
aVJuuling got me off cigarettes for a while. But even then I eventually had to put that down. No better alternative than good ol oxygen friend 
p109
aVI am 1 month 7 days and 3 hours. I used the vape with nicotine free juice and the 'smoke free' app.  The vap isn't becoming a habit but it is a bit of a crutch at this point. I nearly forgot to pack it this morning and had a mini panic. Having said that i will probably only use it twice - this is the habit or work stress induced reaction. The habit is getting more and more phazed out.  The vape is becoming less and less. I still have moods - sad, angry, any emotion.etc, but these are becoming less also. I don't think I would have made it to here without the vape... I got the juul - it's skinny, easy, doesn't leak, a$71Aust.
p110
aVI actually just bought a juul yesterday, I\u2019m hoping it will help in these next couple of weeks/month until I can wean off nicotine. I just know the smell and feel of cigarettes always pulls me back somehow :/
p111
aVOh man the coffee in the morning sounds like a fantastic idea. I\u2019ve never thought of the morning coffee ritual but thinking about it sounds so nice. Maybe a cup of tea or coffee and I can actually smell the nice morning smell of outside like I want to instead of just my cigarettes.\u000a\u000aSomething about the feel and smell of cigarettes just doesn\u2019t compare to vaping but I caved in and bought a juul yesterday to wean off cigs so I\u2019m REALLY hopeful it will help with socializing and my breaks as well. \u000a\u000aWonderful advice, thank you!\u000a
p112
aVThat's what I did too, I made a plan to drop the juul on day 30, I suggest you do something similiar as quiting nicotine was way harder for me than quiting cigarettes. But also without the juul I don't know if I would have been able to drop cigs completely. Just some food for thought
p113
aVYea I\u2019m definitely a tiny bit worried about the nicotine because the juul actually gave me a rush as opposed to vape mods I\u2019ve tried. But I\u2019ll be happy if it stops me from smoking 12-15 cigarettes a day. \u000a\u000aI\u2019m so proud that you dropped the juul after a month though! Nicotine is such a bitch to drop completely, I hope I can have as much self motivation as you.
p114
aVYou can do all of the same things without smoking - or vaping. Go outside and have 10 minutes to yourself. I still do that. Go out and socialize with others while they smoke and you don't. I do that too. Anything you can do as a smoker, you can do as a non-smoker. \u000a\u000aBe careful with the Juul. The nicotine content is so high that many people become more addicted to nicotine than when they smoked tobacco.
p115
aVI\u2019ll admit I\u2019m in school and I wasn\u2019t able to resist so I took a hit from a juul. But I made a promise to myself that it\u2019s my last hit. 
p116
aVI don't know what a juul or a pod is, but if it's anything like cigarettes, then you should have withdrawals of about a month. Give or take a few weeks depending on your usage and so on. Drinking plenty of water/fluids and keeping yourself busy is the best way to get through quitting smoking.
p117
aVIts an e-cig. a "pod" of juul is equivalent to a pack of cigarettes nicotine
p118
aVTry your juul with a NO nicotine juice.? 
p119
aVI had been juuling a pod a day as well, and lurked in this sub to help me through my quit. Honestly, just go cold turkey. Throw away all your pods and the juul itself, i kept telling myself to save it for parties, but don't.  \u000a\u000aThe biggest part that helped me is understanding that it isnt worth a 15-second buzz for the severity of the addiction and all the expenses.\u000a\u000aKeep in mind the longer you quit, the less you'll want a hit.\u000a\u000aBest of luck.

p121
aVHow do you all feel about juul?
p122
aVI went cold turkey. \u000a\u000aJuul is a safer alternative to smoking, but if you search in this sub there are many folks posting about trying to break the addiction of using Juul. It appears a lot of people actually increase nicotine consumption. \u000a\u000aMaybe try cold turkey first? With any addiction, you\u2019re going to have to do the hard work regardless. NRT\u2019s are just guides to help. 
p123
aVIt's working for me. I used it to quit and have went from using their strongest (5%) pods down to 3% pods. I plan to step down to a different pod device soon as Juul doesn't offer 0% nicotine pods yet.
p124
aVI started Juul during the day and smoke blunts at night, does this mean I have kicked cigs?
p125
aVHell yah Less Harm is good. I hit the bong too. Really trying to stay away from the cigs and the Juul has worked. Idk but thanks 
p126
aVI don\u2019t think this is popular in this sub but I usually smoke weed or hit a JUUL pen if I really need to smoke something. 10/10 times it helps.\u000a\u000aWith a Juul you\u2019re having nicotine and for some this could be a pitfall, but you\u2019re also not having the 100 other chemicals included in a cigarette. Plus its vapor, not smoke, since theres no combustion, so it\u2019s just a lot better for you in comparison. Vaping and smoking are very different tastes. I can\u2019t smell stand the smell of a cigarette anymore, so I\u2019m not sure if one leads back to the other.\u000a\u000aWeed curbs my oral fixation, and I smoke weed anyway, so I just do it when I feel any craving. 
p127
aVThose juuls are dangerous. Awesome job!
p128
aVGood for you! Let me know how the Juul works for you - been considering it myself.
p129
aVI was addicted to vaping, most recently a Juul, for 5 years before my current quit attempt.  Juuls are wayyy higher in nicotine than cigarettes are.  Don't use a Juul.  Use another form of NRT.  I'm struggling my ass off to keep myself from running out and buying another Juul to make this nicotine craving go away.
p130
aVMy current plan is to finish the starter pack, buy one round of refills at the 3% concentration, then get a small pen vape and some nic-free juice. The way I look at it, this is not a replacement for smoking. It's a tool to help me quit. If I just switch from spending money on cigarettes to spending money on Juul pods, I'm not really any better off. 
p131
aVthe patch is meant to quit not to reduce your consumption but I understand what you are feeling because a couple of years ago I do the same and it was really stupid.    I reduce my consumption with a juul e cigarrette,  they are simple and work great,  with that thing I was able to go from 1 pack a day to just 1 or 2 cigarretes a day,   after 1 or 2 weeks I went full on vape and I really liked,   after almost 5 months with the vape I start cutting down the vape and it was way easier than before.  I still use the vape but just on weekend and when I'm drinking,  my next goal is to quit vape\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aSo,  my recommendation is try the vape
p132
aVI quit 22 days ago using the juul I\u2019ve tried vaping before and only lasted 4 months but man this Juul is really working for so I\u2019d suggest looking into a cigalike vape
p133
aVI use a Juul. Yes, there's nicotine and I intend on quitting that soon, but i haven't smoked in 7 weeks. Not a cigarette, a drag, nothing. And I have 0 desire for a cigarette, just nicotine right now. \u000a\u000aObviously I'm still addicted to nicotine but I was smoking cigarettes for 10 years and longest before the Juul was 24 hours for me.\u000a\u000aSo without Juul, 24 hours.\u000aWith Juul, 7 weeks strong 
p134
aVYes. I am 22 I've been smoking since I was 16 and got a juul, it took me about the first 3-4 days before i got used to it and stopped smoking cogs. Haven't had a cog in almost 2 months. It sucks because because I still spend as much but I can definitely notice a diffrence in smelling and breathing, I dont mind still being addicted honestly just as long as it's not cigs so I dont smell like complete garbage.
p135
aVI've been refilling the pods and it saves a ton of money, but it doesn't compare to the pod juice quality unfortunately. I smoke the cool mint pods and I use a spearmint nicotine salt juice to refill but still doesn't compare to the lovely peppermint Juul pods.\u000a\u000aStill think it's better to smoke these, than to inhale Chems and carbon monoxide. 
p136
aVGreat job man. You inspire me. I'm on day 12 of no cigs (using a Juul as NRT) but it's been a challenge. My energy level is actually low, I always feel tired. Hopefully its just a phase but Im going to stick with it. 
p137
aVSorry dude but this makes no sense .you are probably putting more nicotine in your body with the juul then you did with cigarettes .\u000aNicotine withdrawals causes withdrawals and low energy DEFINATELY not withdrawals from chemicals,carbon monoxide and tar.(quite the opposite)\u000aYour phase sounds psychological not physical .realise that and you'll get out of it .
p138
aVHey I\u2019m proud of you! That\u2019s a long time and takes strength. \u000a\u000aI vape currently too. The terrifying, scary juul. But it\u2019s helping me right now so much, oh gosh. \u000a\u000aThankfully that slip up repulsed me a lot more than pulling me in!
p139
aVThanks OP, I am also proud of you! You got this\u000a\u000aFrankly, I would opt for a real mod instead of a juul, or at least one where you can put your own juices. The juul pods have alooot of nicotine and with a regular mod you can eventually ween yourself off of it. Also you're gonna pay slot more in the long run for pods than you would with coils and juice 
p140
aVNot sure if it\u2019s frowned upon to talk about products but I tried everything to quit smoking. Like everything I could find. Gum, laser, acupuncture, hypnosis, Chantix, cold turkey and the patch. The JUUL finally did the trick. Been a week and have zero desire for a smoke. 
p141
aVWhat's JUUL?
p142
aVJuul is amazing. I quit smoking the night I took up with my Juul, 5 months without cigarettes. My voice is back,  no cig smell, can Juul anywhere. 
p143
aVHey, I\u2019ll take it. I\u2019ve been smoking for decades and have tried quitting countless times over the years. This is the first time I\u2019ve ever felt like I can comfortably not smoke. The JUUL gives me the muscle memory and still gives me the nicotine, the ritual and routine of a cigarette. I know it\u2019s not getting over the habit but it\u2019s cutting out the majority of the bad stuff. Things on fire are really bad for you. I\u2019m to the point where it\u2019s gotta stop at all costs. So I will take the JUUL and run with it. It feels like I\u2019m having a smoke. 
p144
aVDude this is awesomely encouraging! Congrats! My buddy kicked cigs with the JUUL and I saw a CBS report about vaping versus smoking and the JUUL was talked about specifically. I bought one the next day and seriously haven\u2019t looked back. I tried a cigarette after going without for two days and holy shit it felt and tasted awful. I grinned ear to ear because I knew it was actually working and my days with cigarettes are over. 
p145
aVI haven't tried the Juul because you are still addicted to nicotine so it's just transferring the addiction. Cold turkey is the way to go in my opinion. 
p146
aVNah it was a juul. You can see him using it on other shows too
p147
aVHow was it stopping the juul? Did h quit cold Turkey or force yourself to ween off it?
p148
aVYou can do it without. The hardest thing to get your head around is \u201cnever again\u201d. \u000a\u000aI liked my juul a lot too, but I knew I had to stop. It was a means to an end, not a shiny hobby. \u000a\u000aBe careful with that chantix. 
p149
aVNice! I've been tobacco free 5 weeks but leaning on a juul when I drink. Hoping to be off that soon too
p150
aVI know a juul pod..is 5% nic..and has 200 puffs. So 5 hits of a juul is more or less equal to a cig. Don't know if that helps you in the slightest but yeah. 
p151
aVThank you for taking the time to reply to me. I had to google what a juul pod is and i'm not sure this information helps me too much (or perhaps i'm not smart enough to work out a conversion) but I do appreciate you replying to my post :) 
p152
aVI've been smoke free for 28 days using the juul
p153
aVI believe in you! You got this! Maybe consider a juul or a vape so you can \u2018smoke\u2019 with him without falling back on cigarettes. 
p154
aVJuul is harder to stop than regular cigs bc you can puff it literally anywhere and it becomes a pacifier of sorts. Expensive as shit too. Avoid
p155
aVI quit smoking cigarettes and moved over to the Juul about 2 months ago. I had no idea how I was going to get myself off of that after. Then I was diagnosed with mono 2 and a half weeks ago. Ended up in the hospital and my tonsil swelled up to a ridiculous size. BUT I'm no longer using a Juul now! Worked out in the end.
p156
aVJUUL is worse?
p157
aVI just tossed my juul in the trash last night. Here's the biggest problem with them, it's immediate satisfaction. For me, while working, I would try reaching small goals or solid stopping points before I went outside to have a cigarette (trying to keep it in check, making sure to not smoke more than a half a pack a day). But with the juul, you just pick it up, inside or outside, and because it doesn't smell, you become less and less conscious about it. It may be less harmful, but I found it more addicting for that reason. Also, 1 pod is essentially 1 pack of cigarettes, I would go through a pod in 24hrs, but I could make a pack of cigarettes last closer to 72hrs. So I ended up spending more on juul pods than I ever did on smokes, a lose-lose for me, personally.\u000aBeen smoking for 9yrs, had the juul for about 2months, hated it, never found it nearly as satisfying, and it just felt really lame. Just smoke or don't smoke. And yes, I am having brutal cravings as I type this, but it's satisfying to get it out.
p158
aVGo to zero nic and refuse to give in, before long you wont want the vape. Juul is prime example of how willfully ignorant the vaping community is, it is not a magical unicorn of safety despite what they claim. 
p159
aVWhy not? There are easier alternatives. E-cigs lieke Juuls relieved me, and it was MUCH easier to get off from e-cigs that it was cigs for me.\u000a\u000aEverybody is different but substituting a cigarette for a swisher is kind of taking a step backwards. It's like quitting smoking for chew. It's still the same exact thing in different form.
p160
aVI have, this is how I quit! I told myself the day I started e-cigging that I would stop e-cigging one month later, and I did. I really feel like getting rid of the cig hand movements and all the weird habits  helped me a ton. But I'm not gonna lie, dropping the nicotine completely was harder for me then switching to e-cig. BUT I was using the juul ecig during that month and those things are loaded with nicotine. It wasn't till day 27 or so that I started to wein off the Nicotine.\u000a\u000aI just bought a Pixel 3XL 128 GB with the money I saved not smoking.\u000a\u000aI highly recommend setting a quit date and telling people it.\u000a \u000aYOU GOT THIS!\u000a\u000aOne more thing, I had two juuls, on day 31, I hid them from myself, like out of sight out of mind. 1 was placed in my glovebox and the other in a pocket in my work backpack. I think after day four I was so confident I sold them off and never looked back.\u000a\u000aYOU CAN DO IT!
p161
aVIt absolutely does work this way.  Had a Juul pod leak a decent amount, it was mint so I could feel it all over my lips.  Got a real big buzz.  That being said, highly don't recommend, dosing would be out the window at that point and you're priming yourself to be even more addicted.
p162
aVtbh my juul pods leak a lot into my mouth because i refill them a few times before tossing them, never huge amounts though, and i've never felt a buzz from them. they only taste nasty and numb the mouth/lips. 
p163
aVThe time I was referencing it was indeed a very large amount.  I've had leaks but this was the mother load.  I guess I could've been expecting a high and felt that way as such, but I distinctly remember feeling like I'd just smoked hookah for an hour rather than just puffed a Juul a few times.
p164
aVMy wife made me wash my hands and brush my teeth every time I came in from a smoke... but the only thing that really works is wanting to quit.  I got myself a juul, works great for me.  I tried to back to cigs after using a juul for a few months and couldn't stand the taste anymore.  Now I just gotta quit the juul.... ugh
p165
aVDo you think using the juul makes you smoke more?
p166
aVI still need to quit juul 
p167
aVI still make myself Juul in the garage and on the back porch just like I did when I smoked. It's helped me not constantly hit it and kinda reprogram me. 
p168
aVMy mission today to post to you guys, but 5 days ago I bought a juul and you guys told me to download this app....\U0001f44a\U0001f3fc
p169
aVIf you know you're going to relapse, you could at least do it with a vape. Suorin, Juul, Smok Rolo all feel close to a cigarette when you use strong nicotine salts. That's what I'm doing right now. I'm considering smoking an emergency that needs to stop immediately, and I can deal with quitting the vape eventually. I just know myself and going cold turkey is a bad plan for me. 
p170
aVThe thing is I haven\u2019t been sweating at all. I still juul so I haven\u2019t been getting any nicotine withdrawal symptoms. I also drink ALOT of water
p171
aVI do both. I drink in bursts after taking some vape puffs because it makes me thirsty but I\u2019m usually drinking water constantly throughout the day.\u000a\u000aMaybe it\u2019s the juul adding to the problem?
p172
aVJuul?
p173
aVA thoughtful review on switching to JUUL
p174
aVI know what you mean and I feel the same - there\u2019s a distinct early culture around people that vape and despite what I think you mean, I don\u2019t see myself being part of that culture.\u000a\u000aThe juul vapor isn\u2019t designed to be big and obnoxious. I don\u2019t blow o rings or do other vape tricks. I don\u2019t talk about it or show it publicly, despite writing about it here. I guess I hide it in a way, like I did with smoking - but it\u2019s still my little escape/reward/addiction.\u000a\u000aI get there are risks. But that\u2019s why I came here for perspective. Are the risks greater than smoking cigarettes?
p175
aVThis was actually very similar to my experience with JUULs. They function well from a harm reduction perspective but I never considered myself \u201ccured\u201d while using them.\u000a\u000aAfter about 2 years on them I recognized that I was taking in way more nicotine than I was with cigarettes because I could use them any time and anywhere. I recognized that this higher dose of nicotine was causing me heightened anxiety and I decided to quit JUULs / nicotine all together.\u000a\u000aQuitting JUULs is just as hard as quitting cigarettes but without the immediate reward of not smelling like an ashtray all the time.\u000a\u000aI can\u2019t say they didn\u2019t help because I switched to them before I quit and here I am 6 months nicotine free. I\u2019d just be mindful about how frequently you find yourself puffing on them and recognize that just because you\u2019re breathing easier doesn\u2019t mean that they aren\u2019t harming your mind / body in other ways.
p176

p177
aVwhat is it? It looks kinda like a juul .
p178
aVI would say it is better than JUUL, smoother and much better quality product. \u000a\u000aIt's called [RELXPod](https://www.relxpod.com). My high school friend recommended to me. I was told this the most popular vape product in Asia. 
p179
aVEvery single post/comment from your account created 3 days ago is spamming your JUUL ripoff. I think it's absolutely safe to assume you're just a spam account.
p180
aVI shamefully fall into the Juul in the bathroom group. I get headaches if I don\u2019t do it every 4 hours and there is no way I\u2019ll make it a full day without it 
p181
aVToday marks day one....I\u2019ve tried to quit before many times but life always makes it suck i have used vapes and quit for 4 months once so today I bought a Juul and hopefully after a few months to a year can quit that
p182
aVYou got this, OP! I just celebrated 3 months smoke fre thanks to my juul. They\u2019re gonna be releasing 3% pods soon to help wane off altogether. My dad is two weeks in since I bought him one and he\u2019s smoked for like 40 years, heavily. \u000a\u000aStay strong. All you gotta do is what you\u2019re doing right now: not smoking. 
p183
aVI can relate to this post. Smoking triggered my anxiety as well. I\u2019ve been cigarette free for about a month and nicotine free for a few days. I recommend you buy a vape \u2014 I used the JUUL vape. If stopping entirely is difficult then buy the vape and use the vape for awhile. I waited until my vacation to quit cigarettes and switch to vaping and then quit vaping. You need time to detox. Also bear in mind that it takes awhile for your brain to reboot and not expect the dopamine fix and stimulating effects of nicotine. You will experience fatigue, anxiety, fear, paranoia, etc. But as each day passes it gets easier. Not everyone can quit cold turkey: cigarettes are said to be as addictive or MORE addictive than heroine. Know that by defeating this addiction you will truly be a much better version of yourself. Your confidence will sky rocket. You will have energy to live life. You will realize how disgusting nicotine / smoking is. I know I did. Hope that helps. 
p184
aVTry a MTL (Mouth-to-Lung) Vape-Pen and use very high nicotine e-liquid (18-24mg/ml) or even go to the pod-systems with up to 50mg/ml nicotine (Juul or others) but MTL devices plus high nicotine is better and cheaper.\u000a\u000aEverything but cigarettes.
p185
aVIm underage and trying to quit JUUL for my friends
p186
aVUmm...is this satire? Not trying to be a dick, asking legitimately. If not, then literally just take the Juul along with all your pods, and toss it in the trash. Problem solved. 
p187
aVBuy a juul. I quit 3 weeks ago and haven\u2019t craved a cig since. 
p188
aVJuul. Not sure if you consider this \u201cquitting\u201d or not, but after 7 years of smoking a pack a day I entirely switched within 2 weeks, then cut down from 5% nicotine to 3%, will soon go to 0% then hopefully off it entirely. 
p189
aVIf your in America the Juul pods contain 50mg of nicotine but in the UK they only contain 20mg.\u000a\u000aSomeone who smokes 20 a day is advised to use 12mg strength liquids. This could explain the tight chest feeling you are getting.\u000a\u000aYou might want to think about may be changing the type of vaporizer you are using so you can reduce the nicotine \U0001f609
p190
aVHow long does it take for you to go through a Juul pod?
p191
aVInteresting! Do you find you still get a significant enough headrush from the nicotine in freebase on 12mg to not miss having cigarettes? I just have never had a vape experience like this before which makes me want to continue using the JUUL, but it's illuminating to learn that I'm not the only one who has experienced this with nic salts.
p192
aVKid, I haven\u2019t had a head rush from nicotine since 1994 when I first started smoking:)\u000a\u000aFor me, the throat hit was important, and 18mg of freebase nic did the job. I liked it much better than salts. The whole concept of salts is to make it smoother, but I didn\u2019t prefer smooth. If you do try 18, just take 3 consecutive puffs to equal one Juul puff. \u000a\u000aGoing from 50 to 35 to 25, then to freebase 18 to 12 wasn\u2019t too hard for me, and I smoked 2+ packs a day. \u000a\u000aI\u2019d hate for you to buy gear and new liquid if that\u2019s not the problem, though. I\u2019d send you a spare refillable pod system I have but I\u2019m not sure if I can get it from Texas through Canadian customs. Lol.
p193
aVI appreciate the thought anyway :)\u000a\u000aI'm going to see if I can get my hands on a Breeze 2 in the meantime, they're not too expensive (cheaper than a Juul) so it's worth a shot at least.\u000a\u000aI was thinking of going back to just smoking but that just doesn't really work out long-term because that gave me the same problems with breathing.\u000a\u000aIn the end, it may actually just be the nicotine causing the issues (I have relatively high blood pressure, I wonder if high blood pressure and shortness of breath have any connection?)\u000a\u000aIf that is the case, I might just have to say goodbye to nicotine. 
p194
aVI BOUGHT A JUUL JUST TO BE A MEME (satire I think juul's are dumb)
p195
aVI felt horrible the few times I smoked while walking my doggo. Really hit me in the feels about how bad I was at controlling my cravings. I'm using a juul now, and when I walk her while using it I don't feel as bad.
p196
aVI downgraded to Juul. I still smoked the same amount, and it it still gave me the same kick. In the end though, I wasn't getting carcinogens and smelliness and that was confidence boosting. Is there any support group you have outside of this subreddit?
p197
aVI don't know what a juul is but I can empathize with your paranoia. It's what has helped me quit.
p198
aVI was already planning to throw away my Juul tomorrow. I'm down.
p199
aVYes vapes got me to quit cigarettes but you will quickly realize vapes have many drawbacks. You can chain vape anywhere and get blasted with the higher nicotine. I can sit in my room all day sucking down $5-15 worth of juul pods or juice and not have to get up to go outside. I also feel as if juuls with their nicotine salts are MUCH more addicting. I have never fiended for nicotine like this before! It's expensive and more addicting. Work on quitting with other aids or try to use vapes to ween yourself off. Don't fall into the trap of thinking vapes are so much better and spending hundreds of $ on juice and vape upgrades. 
p200
aVMy personal experience is that I was a pack a day smoker and I quit smoking cigarettes 2 months ago and vaped as a replacement (mostly e-cig, sometimes juul) as a transition. I successfully stopped vaping 3 weeks ago. I stopped vaping cold turkey when I realized how easy it was to worsen my addiction - not needing to go outside, not really being able to measure how much I was smoking, etc. It did help me to take the edge off so I could hold down my job and not kill anyone.  And there were probably a handful of times that I would have caved and had a cigarette without it, like hanging out with friends who were smoking while drinking. I think you need to find what works for you and what will ultimately get you 100% off nicotine. We all have our journeys. I personally don't think vaping is any less "valid" than using the patch for example. But I know for me getting off everything as quickly as possible was my ultimate goal.
p201
aVQuitting e-cigs (juul)
p202
aVIt seems like a good thing for you is to taper yourself off over a long period of time. Your body is super dependent on nicotine. You can try and get some 3% pods from juul and start there. Then you can start bringing in some non nicotine pods to help ween yourself off slowly. There are some non nicotine pods at [cyclonepods.com](https://cyclonepods.com). Good luck and hang in there
p203
aVNope, I replaced it with a juul and now I\u2019m addicted to that. Try candy. 
p204
aVThanks for the reply! I bought a cheapo 0% with the juul return money, hopefully it works.
p205
aVIf you liked the juul there are some non nicotine pods at [cyclonepods.com](https://cyclonepods.com) that you could check out. hope that can help buddy
p206
aVHi there, if she won't quit we do offer an alternative. There is vaping, and this will offer her nearly the same experience, with less health consequences. Plus, it is more enjoyable because of the flavor options. We would like to offer you 10% off to get your mom a vape, just use code "reddit10" at checkout.  We would recommend something like the JUUL, as this is the most similar product we have to an actual cigarette. Hope this helps!\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a\u005c- VapeGodShop(.com)
p207
aVSounds like you need a healthier upgrade. We are an online vape retailer, and people come to us with these problems all of the time. Vaping is about 95%-99% safer than smoking (depending on who you ask). So, why vape? It's healthier, more flavor options, and it's easy. Simply charge a device and you're good to go. We would recommend looking into a JUUL, Suorin Air, or a SMOK Novo. We also offer reddit users 10% off with code "reddit10" at checkout. Start a safer and more relaxing life today.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a\u005c- VapeGodShop(.com)

aVI smoked for 11 years then Vaped for 30 days and as of today I am 99 days nicotine free. It was harder to drop the vape than cigs but you can do it.\u000a\u000aTBH vaping the juul gave me bad anxiety at times. Set a quit date and stick to it. I still carried a vape in car and backpack but I kept it out of sight and just kept them around for a few days, kind of like a safety net was my thinking..
p209
aVWell if you use a NRD the juul believe it or not is great and you can go to a vape shop get some juice and refill the pods like 2/3 times each I'm 32 smoked Newport 100 for 15 yrs I quit using a vape. It works 
p210
aVYour body is already nicotine free at this point, so using any kind of nicotine now would be a big step backwards.  Juul in particular seems to make people more addicted to nicotine than they were smoking cigarettes. Sounds like you're doing great cold turkey.\u000a\u000aIf you haven't discovered Joel Spitzer videos yet, you might want to check him out. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCag4hg_fX_NnOb1N4yXA97Q . The guy really understands everything about quitting. He helped me a lot. 
p211
aVFirst things first: WTF is a juul? Never mind. I'll just assume it's a variant of a vaporizer. BTW those are becoming an epidemic among teens. This is your first clue how great these so called alternatives will help in any capacity. Stop listening to the legalized drug pushers. Anyone staying otherwise is full of bunk. I've smoked for 25 years , and am coming up on my 5th year without that crap. \u000a\u000aI've done my research and did it cold turkey. Before making new excuses of why you can't do the same, hear yourself making them excuses. That's the little fuck you want to destroy. Right there in front of you. Blocking the exit. Its called ADDICTION. \u000a\u000aI'm not saying it's going to be easy to quit cold turkey. It, in fact, was comparable ( for myself ) to drowning in a pool, while letting it happen. But there are many things you can do that helps dramatically. Do your research and start learning. A lifestyle change is very helpful and possibly beneficial depending on your choice. Personally, it was taking up running.\u000a\u000aI'll not teach you everything though. There's a book, no matter how annoying it is to read that will help the most, But only if you soak in its knowledge. "Carr's easyway to quit smoking" read that thing multiple times til you "get it". Then drop the cigarettes/vapes/Chanix (trainrekts\U0001f605)/patches.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p212
aVRemind yourself that you will not feel better if you smoke a cigarette or puff on a a Juul. Because you've made it long enough without putting nicotine in your body that it actually, truly WILL make you feel bad if you do it.
p213
aVDay 3. Patch, gum, and Juul. Am I doing this wrong?
p214
aVIf you're using patches, gum, and a Juul, you are probably overdosing on nicotine. The Juul by itself has as much nicotine as a cigarette does. You need to trim that back... a lot. Get rid of the Juul or you're going to regret it. If you don't believe me, scroll back through some of the posts on here and look for mentions of Juul. Those things are worse than cigarettes from an addiction level.
p215
aVI haven't used the Juul a ton, mostly a reusable Blu e-cig, but I'm sure the point still stands
p216
aVCongrats Man I\u2019m currently on day 15 cold turkey no patches, medication, gum, vape, or juul. I have noticed I have more energy but also yes I have had an increase in stress 
p217
aVThanks for your reply. \u000a\u000aI'm using the JUUL starter-kit. I'm also trying to quit other bad habits at the same time so its probably a combination of that. I feel much better today. :)
p218
aVEvery time I see an article titled \u201cteenage juul use may cause them to shut down\u201d I die a little inside.
p219
aVWhat's your plan for getting off the Juul?
p220
aVGood. Stick with your plan and don't stay on 3% very long. You may take fewer puffs off a Juul per day than you did with cigarettes, but Juul delivers a lot of nicotine. 
p221
aVI just stopped this weekend. Woke up barely able to breath (unrelated to cigarettes) but it made me realize how dumb it is to smoke.\u000a\u000aIt's been 100 hours since I've had a cigarette and NEVER thought I could ever made it this far without one. Granted I'm using a Juul to help with the cravings, still I'm proud. Planning on buying lower and lower nic juice for the juul and getting to the point where I no longer need nicotine. \u000a\u000aI highly recommend a Juul honestly. It's still nicotine but getting rid of the cigarettes first, helped/helps me. I see cigarettes now and I'm repulsed. My fingers no longer stink and all in all I feel proud of myself. 10 year addiction and I'm slowly getting off of it.\u000a\u000aYou can do it OP. But you have to want it. I want to live. You should too.\u000a\u000a
p222
aVMake a planned quit date. Tell people about the planned quit date.\u000a\u000aOn the quit date: Enjoy the last vape, it's the last one you will ever have(take a picture so you can see the timedate stamp of your very last vape and so you can show your future kids how dumb you once looked with a metal battery in your mouth.).\u000a\u000aDays 1 - 2 or 3: Bring the juul with you for one to two days, or three if the struggle is real. This is just so you feel like you have a safety net if you need one, you won't though! You got this! P.S. try to avoid touching ecig stuff as just a little juice on the fingertip will heighten nicotine levels which will only prolong the pain before the great sensation of fresh tasting food. Seriously, food will taste so dang good after a like a week, your taste buds are gonna love you!\u000a\u000aDay 4 - 5 or 6: Hide the juul in the cupboard, center console, places you wont see them.\u000a\u000aDay 7 or as soon as you are ready: Sell it all! Be free, sing to yourself, "I want to break free!" -Queen --&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUOtCLOXgm8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUOtCLOXgm8)\u000a\u000aDay 8: Feel free, leave the house without thinking about if you have E-juice, batteries, ecig or if the battery is charged.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aNOTE: This is pretty much what I did after 11 years smoking and 1 month juuling.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aP.S. - Whatcha gonna do with all the money you saved?
p223
aVI vaped for a few months before I quit and ended up being very addicted to nicotine\u000aI actually spent more time vaping than I did smoking. I used the Juno, which is similar to the Juul, and felt as enslaved to that as I did cigarettes.\u000a\u000aMy approach was throwing away the Juno and the  pods. I knew it was probably going to be as intense as quitting smoking but that each craving would only last a certain amount of time. By the time I drove to the vape shop the craving would be over. \u000a\u000aIt's worked so far! \u000a\u000aGood luck'
p224
aVWow... this could almost be my post, word for word.  I'm in pretty much the exact situation.  I feel great for not having touched a cigarette for months and it's great that I'm not inhaling burning tobacco, but I'm spending as much (if not more) on juul pods.\u000a\u000aI'm also finding myself doing the same stupid things when I run out as I was when I used to smoke (late night runs to the 7/11 to buy more, even in shit weather), with the downside of being able to vape far more than I smoked (indoors, the bathroom, my office, etc).\u000a\u000aI'm trying to figure out how I'm going to do this myself.  So far I'm thinking nic patches are the trick, but haven't committed to the plan yet.  Cold turkey is probably the best bet.  At least the upside is that in the meantime we know that vaping is not nearly as dangerous as cigarette smoke.  [shrug]
p225
aVI'm 2 weeks smoke free (cold turkey) and never heard about Juul until now. Damn it now I keep thinking about juuling.
p226
aV \u000a\u000a&gt;For me, driving is one of my biggest triggers. I really hate driving, but I drive about 500 miles each week. Vaping has always made driving more tolerable. ... Perhaps I could just keep a box mod for my car and vape while I drive. \u000a\u000a\u005c--&gt; Nice to hear that someone besides me hate to drive cars :-) It is one of my biggest triggers, too.  So for this situation, I would agree to have a e-cigarette with very low nicotine as you said max 3 mg; also use very low contens of  flavouring substances (a third of recommend or your personal regular dose). And please never take your only-for-car-e-cigarette out of the car, never ever!\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a&gt;Isn't that sad? I have convinced myself that a stick that heats up chemicals that I suck into my lungs is what I need to get through the day and/or to make the day more enjoyable. \u000a\u000a\u005c--&gt; That is only because you are an addict. You need this just to feel normal like non addicts. "More enjoyable" for an addict just means addiction without facing/ having withdrawals at this moment. The only way to get out of this is to be an totally non-nicotine consumer for a long time (at least months in my opinion, but it will get better after \u005c~2weeks from day to day with some hard-to-take downs and even some nice ups)\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a&gt; A third option is to continue buying Juul pods and rationing them to myself. Limiting myself to one pack per week at first ( I usually go through about 1 and 1/2 to 2 packs per week), and slowly going down and down until a pod lasts me a week. I think that quitting would be relatively easy at that point. \u000a\u000a\u005c--&gt; For some (in my opinion few) people this could be an option. But you sound like you are very nicotine-addicted. Your addicted brain will have some options like an unconsciously depper inhaling to get more nicotine out of one toke. And your nicotine-brain will trick you that it doesn't have to face nicotine-withdrawals. The same is if you lower the nicotine-content (esp. in smaller steps)\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aSo maybe except of the car situation (only in the first weeks) I would suggest you use an e-cigarette completely without nicotine (cold turkey). If the withdrawals are too hard then use half/1third of the nicotine you were used to for a week or two. And then lower the dose to 0. Also, lower flavouring substances drastically.\u000a\u000aThat helped me alot. Esp. in the first weeks i sucked all the time. But eventually my brain learned that there is absolute nothing rewarding about sucking a vape that doesn't taste very good (due to maximim lowered flavours) and does not contain a (very very hard but legal) drug.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;
p227
aVI haven't used it but my roommate is a hardcore, 1 pack a day minimum, smoker and he switched to Juul and swears by it.
p228
aVI just want to vent, I recently gave up my juul. Long after cigarettes and it just sucks right now.
p229
aVTell yourself this is temporary and going back would just prolong the pain.\u000a\u000aNicotine in all forms can be a serious addiction so don't underplay juul, smoking, or any other delivery.
p230
aVMaybe talk to someone who will hold you accountable and set up a plan to wean off the juul rather than just quitting all at once. I don\u2019t know for certain if that\u2019d help or make things worse, but cold turkey withdraws from a juul are pretty gut wrenching and difficult in my experience. I also use one and am a former smoker but I\u2019m talking with my therapist about quitting. 
p231
aVGet some gum. Cinnamon or something with a strong flavor. Whenever you get the urge, put in a piece of gum. Chew the hell out of it. Take your frustration out on the gum. The urge will pass. \u000a\u000aEventually you mind will associate the urge with the gum... which tastes a million times better and is a lot better for you. \u000a\u000aYou replaced smokes with vape. Replaced vape with the juul... which is still vape, so now you need to replace the vape with something else. Your brain will make the switch. \u000a\u000aI smoked for almost 15 years. Vaped for another 7 or so. This works. 
p232
aVWas your last nicotine in MAy (in any form including patch, juul, gum, patch)?\u000a\u000aWould you consider yourself a regualr to heavy coffee drinker? \u000a\u000aDid you use any meds to help you quit?  Wellbutrin or chantix? 
p233
aVI'll chime in with a patch endorsement. I tried the gum in the past and didn't like the taste very much, not to mention you have to chew it a *certain way.* I use the patch, and I  also  chew regular gum when I have certain kinds of cravings (e.g. after lunch).\u000a\u000aGood on you for thinking about doing this now. The longer you wait the more experiences you'll have with the cigarette (or juul) as your "companion". It's only recently that I've started thinking about all the life shit (good and bad) I went through while smoking. It didn't make it impossible to stop; just a bit harder because those associations get stronger and stronger. So doing it now you're saving yourself a bigger pain in the ass down the line.
p234
aVI just wanted to say you can't smoke a Juul, unless you -really- do it wrong. The Juul could be a very useful step to quitting nicotine, good luck!
p235
aVWhaaaat you\u2019re tweaking if anything the juul made nicotine more accessible to me 
p236
aVJuul is extremely high nicotine so it actually strengthens the nicotine addiction.
p237
aVIf you're having a hard time quitting completely, there is always the option of getting an e-cig or vape. These are no doubt much healthier and the cost is definitely lower. Nicotine isn't the harmful part of ciggs, it's the chemicals. This is just an option if you're finding it impossible to quit, if you can quit completely then awesome! If not, I would recommend checking out products such as the JUUL or Suorin Air. Search "VapeGodShop" on google and you can browse what we have to offer. Use code "reddit10" at checkout for 10% off. Quit smoking, it's the best thing you can do to live longer and happier. 
p238
aVAnyone else never smoked a ciggerrete? (Quitting juul)
p239
aVSeveral missteps here! People do not copy this quit! \u000a\u000aThe WORST thing you could have done was interrupt your chant-ix to go cold turkey to go to Juul.  It don;t work like that! Each one is going to negate the other. \u000a\u000aYou just wasted a lot of days, a lot of medicine, a lot of Juul, a lot of cold turkey. \u000a
p240
aVIt is wrong and hes a complete douche canoe. Dont listen to this gatekeeping prick. There is nothing wrong with your quit. 5 days is awesome. You do you. You can do this. If you need the juul to help the transition then use the juul. Just remember you are just trading one delivery method for another. But the juul is far and away a safer alternative. Just dont ever pick up a cigarette again. Thats half the battle. Putting down the vape can come when youre ready. One step at a time! :)
p241
aVHi guys! Thanks again for all the support. I am now seven days, that's a WHOLE WEEK, with no cigarettes. I started the Juul on Tuesday, I have to admit I ran home so I could get it from the mailbox on my way to my second job. But now that I have it I don't see myself smoking cigs again! I even reused a very beautiful tin a friend made years ago as my carrying case, and it's wayyyy nicer than any cardboard pack. \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aThis morning, I ran about a mile and a half. I haven't gone running in months, and it was wonderfully not painful! I actually enjoy working out! Thanks again for handling the "gatekeepers," I'm looking forward to getting my 900+ days!
p242
aVShit. I\u2019ve been juuling forever. Been a long time since cigs but not I\u2019m scared to set down the juul 
p243
aVoha, searched the inet, because i didn't know anything about Juul. But what the hell: 59 mg of nicotine??!?! halleluja thats like heroin-fentanyl. how can anything like that be legal?? if someone wants to get nicotine addicted, i would suggest to start with juul, within a few weeks you are so used to nicotine you can soon start to smoke 10 packs of cigarettes/ day.\u000a\u000ai wish you good luck with your setting down. do it slowly, i would suggest to buy an e-cigarette where you can easily lower the nicotine content from time to time. if you do cold turkey, i am sure it would be similar to an opioid withdrawal (never had by my own, only friends tbh). give you enough time and it would be cool if you post sth. on reddit to share your experience and progression

aVNew smoke free user here as well! 250 hours smoke free!\u000a\u000aCouldn\u2019t have done it without my new best friend, the juul. Congrats to you and your husband!
p249
aVCongrats to you!\u000a\u000aI´m at 24 days using a Vape-Pen (Exceed D19) and I´m doing fine and I can regulate how much nicotine is in the liquid.\u000a\u000aJuul is very high-nicotine content and I would advise anyone to swith to something else, because you don´t need 50mg/ml especially not if you want to hit it because of the habit and not dependency.\u000a\u000aKeep it up!
p250
aVI did the exact same thing but instead of Juul mine was the Juno,  Crazy addicted to that thing.\u000a\u000aCongratulations on kicking everything to the curb and awesome on those 30 days! \U0001f389
p251
aVCongratulations, you\u2019ve got this! I used a juul to get through the first 3 weeks of my quit (I had initially planned to use it for the first month but after misplacing it in week 3, I just went with it). I decided to quit at one of the most stressful points of my life/ career which may seem crazy, but now I can\u2019t use stress as an excuse for backsliding. Last week I hit 2 months smoke free and, aside from one drunken night that I ended up sucking on a straw pretending it was a cigarette, it hasn\u2019t been that bad! Now I feel too stubborn to smoke again, I don\u2019t want to reset my counter! You can do it!!
p252
aVI dropped cigs and only Vaped the juul for a month while browsing this sub silently.. then I dropped the juul. I mainly used this sub as a source of motivation seeing everyone else stopping too.\u000a\u000aJust somethings I noticed.\u000aWithout the vape I don't think I would have been able to quit cigs. I've tried more times than I can count.\u000aDropping cigs and only using juul was pretty simple compared to dropping the ecig too. Nicotine withdrawals are real.\u000aAnyone can do it! \u000a\u000aalso in my humble opinion: this is is the internet, F what people say if you don't like it, simply ignore and move along.\u000a\u000aGood luck, you got this!
p253
aVWorked AMAZING for me, I live in a recreational state and buy the pure CBD cartridges to vape, no THC, no nicotine, no juul etc. No head high or if there\u2019s one I can\u2019t feel it, I can work, focus, workout etc. Just sucks because I travel so much, flying every weekend and I can\u2019t take my vape pen with me for obvious legal reasons. 
p254
aVYou have to resist the urge, it will be difficult but you control your body. Just don\u2019t do it no matter what. I was the same way but I just told myself every time I felt the cravings \u201cthis is how I\u2019m supposed to feel right now, it will get better and better\u201d and it really does. If you do buy a vape I suggest the Juul, it has helped me a lot.
p255
aVAnyone trying or tried the juul?
p256
aVI was curious about a Juul to quit cigarettes.. as a stepdown.\u000a\u000aGood question, man.
p257
aVDo a search here on Juul and you'll see that switching from vaping to a Juul is going from the frying pan into the fire. They are extremely high in nicotine.\u000a\u000aI don't think nicotine addiction in any form is ever something to be excited about. \u000a
p258
aVMy switch from box mod to JUUL was when my nicotine addiction got very bad, so 100% agree here. 
p259
aVI got a JUUL to stop smoking cigarettes and ended up even more nicotine addicted because of it.  Just got a myBlu because the nicotine level is lower in its pods. Seems to be ok so far.  There are a lot more options out there now for small, pen-like vapes other than the JUUL, just make sure to find one with a lower nic level!
p260
aVDude, the withdrawal from juuling is way worse...\u000aMy addiction went from bad to worse the moment I switched...\u000aThose things are crazy high in nicotine...\u000aI\u2019d recommend doing it cold turkey. \u000aThat\u2019s what worked for me. \u000aIt\u2019s two to three weeks of hell and then the rest of your life free so long as you can eat over the occasional craving but even those fade after some time. 
p261
aVI switched to juul on June 1st. My plan was to use it less and less until I'm back nicotine free. I Haven't had a cigarette since but I'm also realizing how addicted I am to this thing. When I can't charge it or if I've misplaced it I start to think "ok maybe I'll just smoke a cigarette for now" I haven't and hopefully will not but it's made me realize in order to no longer be a smoker you have to ditch the nicotine addiction. They also create a lot of waste when you're going through a pod every day or two. I'm glad I was able to stop smoking cigarettes but now I have a new habbit I have to kick.
p262
aVHonestly, you might not even know it but this is one of the best choices you can make. I spent more money on JUULing then I ever did on my box mod, and I am (was) a very avid vaper. It\u2019s a pure nicotine stick and the withdrawal is not worth it, especially when you can get more fulfilling juices and flavors.
p263
aVI have no direct experience with the Juul, but I do with a vape pen. Didn't work for me, actually got more addicted it that thing than I did normal smokes. \u000a\u000aymmv. Good luck!
p264
aVI picked up a juul the other day and have had 2 cigarettes since. The first one was alright but the second one tasted horrendous, like how had I been smoking for that long? The juul seems more satisfying to me too than other vapes I've tried in the past.
p265
aVI've owned four Juuls
p266
aVStop celebrating the Fourth of Juul-aye and celebrate Independence Day instead!
p267
aVSame! The juul pods helped me move off the "take a walk around the block and smoke a cig habit" and I instead replaced it with the adult pacifier. \u000a\u000aI switched to the nicotine patch and holy shit it is working. I think the juul helped me move away from smoking being the way i take a break from life but it made me way way more nicotine dependent.   \u000a\u000a\u000aThe patch really makes withdrawal and urges way easier to manage. I'm on step 2, about 21 days in and I'm feeling really good about my quitting. 
p268
aVJuul+begleri=my new ritual. It\u2019s good.
p269
aVI quit with the juul, got one for my dad and now he\u2019s quitting too
p270
aVdid you directly transition from cigs to the juul? slowly taper off? or just drop cigs one day and pick up the juul? some details would be great.
p271
aVYou have been using for a year. You aren't weening yourself off, you are helping to cement your addiction. Throw the Juul, the vape, and any other source of nicotine you have in the garbage and just stop. Within less than a month you will barely remember having ever used tobacco. At that point, the only issue you will ever have is falling into the trap of believing that you are safe to use it occasionally. Don't think about it, don't consider it, don't set a quit date. Just do it now and you'll feel better by the time Labor Day weekend rolls around.
p272
aVThanks. The social isolation was the part of the reason I quit chewing. I was so addicted that I would chew in front of women I was interested in. If I go to a party, half the people have a JUUL and the other half are mooching off of them.
p273
aVI\u2019m also on this journey. I\u2019ve invested in a Juul to help with the process. The creme brûlée pods are my favorite! 
p274
aVJust quit smoking but I bought a juul?
p275
aVFrom what I've seen on here, the Juul does nothing to get you over the addiction. Sure, you get away from a lot of the nasty stuff that cigarettes have, but you'll stay just as addicted, if not worse. I'd suggest anything else but it. \u000a\u000aJust my $0.02 though. Hang in there. At least stay off of cigarettes. 
p276
aVthank you! I know the juul isn\u2019t helping my actual addiction I just hope once I get my CBD pen I can really stay away from nicotine and cigarettes in general 
p277
aVHere with ya, on day 6 of quitting the Juul myself. No more nicotine!
p278
aVI was in the same position as you about 3 weeks ago. I picked up a e-cig (like the JUUL they sell there in the States). It's still got nicotine, but the dosage is so low so the withdrawal symptoms don't hit so hard. I'm down to taking a few  drags once in the morning and then before I go to bed. This coming from smoking a pack a day to me is a huge victory. I still get tiny cravings, but I eat an apple every time it happens. A craving lasts approx 3 minutes so do something else to take your mind of it. I say take the leap and quit. Get a e-cig and give it a go.
p279
aVFound a website that says it's 18mg/ml. That's pretty high up there. No where near Juul level, but as much as a real cigarette. When I quit I started out with 9mg/ml. \u000a\u000aHang in there, hopefully it'll just be a quick detox this time. 
p280
aVHow I Quit the Juul
p281
aVThe biggest problem I see is that, unlike cigarettes, you can get away with getting a fix almost anywhere. When I started vaping to quit I had to force myself to treat it like a cigarette so I wasn't constantly puffing on it. I was using very low nicotine levels, so I can only imagine what a Juul would be like. \u000a\u000aHang in there, you can beat this. \u000a\u000a\u000a&gt;Juul is well aware we do not need 5 mg's of nicotine.\u000a\u000aAlso, slight correction and probably just a type-o, but you said the Juul was 5mg. It's more like 50mg. You're point is very well taken regardless. 
p282
aVDefinitely a big thing down here for the rush, see tons of people with one of these now.\u000a\u000aAlmost tastes like a cigar/cigarette, it's weird. I've tried someone else's Juul with a mango flavor -- reminded me of a blunt.\u000a\u000aYeah they like the rush but that rush goes away! Good for you on putting it down, within a week or two I doubt you'll think about it as much. Once week one is down, half the battle is won.\u000a\u000aGood luck, you can do it!
p283
aVCongrats on quitting! I'm so so glad to see a fellow Juul quitter here, I quit smoking cigarettes years ago but unfortunately got lured back into vaping. I was at most a 10 a day cigarette smoker, but with the Juul I'd have days I went through a pod and a half (Juul estimates 1 pod to be about 20 cigs worth of nicotine). Day 4 here of zero nicotine, right here with ya!
p284
aVAddicted to Juuling
p285
aVFirstly is "Juuling" not smoking but regardless:\u000a\u000aSwitch to normal Vape(-Pen) and taper off the nicotine in the liquid if the nicotine-withdrawal is your problem and stop vaping once you are at 0 nicotine or maybe jump off at 3mg or 1.5mg/ml.
p286
aVI just quit juuling cold turkey a week ago. It's bad the first few days, but gets easier. The hardest part is insomnia. Let's just say it is 5am currently... yeah. The only way to stop juuling is to go cold turkey. Cutting down your intake is too tempting/easy to forget. I suggest throwing it in the trash. \u000a\u000aIf you don't mind insomnia for a week or so, then you will be okay. I've been getting 2-4 hours a night. Other than that, it's not that hard. \u000a\u000aAlso, exercising like riding a bike helps a lot by getting aggression out. \u000a\u000aMy biggest tip for you is to make the decision to never juul again before you quit- otherwise you will run straight back to it after the first couple of days (which are the hardest).\u000a\u000aQuitting is not easy by any means but it is also not as hard as you think. Its better to quit than be enslaved by an addicting market that wants your money at any cost to you. \u000a\u000aGood luck!
p287
aVI can't lie, Day 2 and a hit from my juul sound pretty nice right now.
p288
aVI quit smoking by vaping. Different techniques work for different people. It's my opinion that if you are reducing your nicotine level regularly and working your way toward nicotine freedom, vaping is good. If you pick up a Juul and start sucking down the same amount of nicotine you were when you were smoking, you've just swapped one delivery mechanism for another. 
p289
aVHonestly, you are still addicted to a form of smoking so I would kindly say that it's not really even close. Not to judge you, just to be real. I tried using a Juul for a few weeks. I was just a smoker using a Juul instead of a cigarette.
p290
aVThat\u2019s one reason I finally ditched the Juul, not having an option to decrease the nicotine level made me realize they are not trying to help you quit just trying to make you use the Juul in lieu of tobacco.
p291
aVSounds like a tight mouth to lung draw would be good for you. Which is also nice because those products usually cost less, use less juice, and use less battery power. You could start with a Juul or something like that. Nice and easy. If you think that might not be enough, get a mod and a tank. Then you can change you're juice easily and they cost less than pod systems in the long run. If you do get a Juul or some kind of pen style little guy, GO TO A VAPE SHOP. The shit they sell in gas stations is cheap, but they break easily, aren't very satisfying, and have short battery life. You don't want to be in the middle of a craving only to find out you're vape is dead.
p292
aVThe overwhelming answer here will be, as it should be, "Don't do it. It's bad." This is a forum of people who are at serious stages of quitting, so this is the only correct answer to your question.\u000a\u000aAs someone who's using vape as an NRT to remain smoke free, however, I infer from your post that you've already resigned yourself to a social relapse being an inevitability. If this is the case, then I guess what you really should be asking is, "How can I minimize the damage?"\u000a\u000aFirst of all, it's at least somewhat positive that you intend to relapse with a vape and not an actual cigarette. It's definitely the lesser of two evils.\u000a\u000aIf there's no question at this point that you've already made up your mind that you're definitely going to vape socially, I recommend avoiding your buddy's Juul and investing in your own vape that allows you to choose a low nicotine or, preferably NO nicotine juice option.\u000a\u000aEither you'll decide, a) "I like to vape socially. Even without nicotine, it prevents me from smoking which is my ultimate goal," or b) "Vaping without nicotine is pointless. I don't enjoy it. Therefore I need to quit vaping altogether."\u000a\u000aSo again, no you shouldn't do it. But if you're already going to do it anyway, at least try to minimize the damage. 
p293
aVI mean, the thing is that I have pretty solid willpower, but I love to get drunk with my boys and I'll probably take a few rips of one of their Juuls the next time we go out boozing. It's not like I'm gonna wake up the next morning and go throw another $50 down the drain to buy my own Juul afterwards, I just don't wanna go through the whole foggy head/anxiety thing for another two days if I rip one of my friends. 
p294
aVFair. Only reason I'd assume my case would be different is because I was only Juuling for 6 months and wasn't ever hopelessly addicted to it. Just kinda enjoyed ripping Juul. 
p295
aVThe Juul pods pack a much higher dose of nicotine than even most cigarettes, though, which is why I'm suggesting investing in your own vape with low to no nicotine over the Juul.
p296
aVYou're right. It's definitely good advice. I'll probably try to find some 0 nic juice I can refill my Juul pods with. It's really the social aspect and act of taking a rip that I enjoy. Better alternative then getting drunk and bumming all my friends' Juuls anyway. 
p297
aVI got off of cigarettes with the Juno ( similar to the Juul). For me I went from being addicted to vaping instead of smoking. I\u2019m not sure how good vaping is in terms of getting completely off nicotine, but it\u2019s probably one of the best way to actually get people off cigarettes.\u000a\u000aI stopped vaping over three months ago and maybe quitting after vaping made it a little easier.  I\u2019m convinced  that big tobacco puts addictive things in cigarettes to make it harder to quit. 100% convinced.\u000a\u000aGood luck!\u000a\u000a
p298
aVThank you man I appreciate it! \u000aI think it just depends on how long you use. \u000aI\u2019ve heard some people say it takes two months while others said two weeks, were all different. \u000aFor me it was a mont and five days.\u000a\u000aHow long did you use and roughly how much? \u000aI was using about a juul pod a day along with some dip and one or two backwoods gas station cigars. (I know, disgusting) \u000aI was only addicted for roughly a year though before I knew I had to quit. 
p299
aVTry salt nicotine in a pod system! I picked up one called Juul at a gas station and it\u2019s helped me tons. Gave me the same throat feel as a cigarette. The other day I upgraded to one called the Aspire Breeze 2. Mainly because it\u2019s refillable and the juul pods are like $20 for a 4 pack. Still less than I was spending on smoking, but still not cheap. Each juul pod is comparable to a pack of cigarettes, but I found I wasn\u2019t going through an entire pod a day. Usually salt nicotine is very high concentrates so it\u2019ll get you the nicotine fix very efficiently. 
p300
aVUpdate: I've been totally cigarette free for a week. I'd cut down a little bit every day, supplementing in a traditional vape and nicotine gum. The big change was getting a JUUL (which I'll admit I thought were some dumb hipster shit until I tried one), which took my from half a pack a day to 2 cigarettes a day almost immediately. Here's to hoping I'm still cigarette free come Halloween! I even did some heavy drinking over the weekend and didn't succumb! 
p301
aVTwo things. First, consider reading Allen Carr's book. You need to reprogram the way you view cigarettes. Once you finally understand that smoking doesn't help with stress, you can deal with the cravings a lot better.\u000a\u000aSecond, NRT isn't going to stop you from having cravings, that's not the point of it. NRT is to help control the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can focus on the mental cravings. About the only thing that I have heard people using that will get you off of cigarettes with no withdrawal is a Juul, but when you do that you're just trading one addiction for another and you'll never get free.\u000a\u000aThe only way to get clean is to go through the process. Take a deep breath, toss out the cigarettes, and don't smoke again. It isn't going to be easy, you're going to crave a cigarette, you're brain is even going to fight you through the process, coming up with some pretty good arguments for why you should smoke. You are going to have to fight through it and know that eventually, you'll be free.\u000a\u000aYou said that you're a veteran. That means you went through basic. AFAIK, you can't smoke in basic, which means that you've gone at least 8 weeks without a cigarette before. If you can make it 8 weeks without a cigarette again, you'll be free of the physical addiction and at a point where you'll be strong enough to fight off cravings when they occur. Focus on that. Just make it 8 weeks. You've done it before, you can do it again.
p302
aVQuit smoking for almost 3 weeks now. Smoking since I was 16 and turning 22 next month. Switched to using a Juul. Wondering about next step and what to look forward to.

aVI did the Juul for the first 30 days, and I\u2019ve been off nicotine now for 3 days. For me, the Juul wasn\u2019t nearly as hard to kick as cigarettes. I just carry some Nicorette around in case I\u2019m feeling tempted. No issues yet, and congrats on quitting!
p304
aVDid nicotine free give you the good throat hit though? I don\u2019t like the juul because it gave me a headache and i was crazy hooked on it still. But I want a nicotine free vape for when I drink. I just want something that gives me an ok throat hit while I\u2019m drinking.
p305
aVCongrats on moving away from smoking. There are  non nicotine juul compatible pods that may interest you at [https://cyclonepods.com](https://cyclonepods.com/). It has helped some people ween themselves away from nicotine.
p306
aVI use the Eleaf iStick 30W. It was the first 'large contraption' type vape I ever got because the little vape pens like the Juul, Blu, etc never worked for me. I always went back to smoking in a week or 2. The benefit to the larger, adjustable vapes is that you can control the size and feel of your hits. I like a lower temp and an...uh... easy suck I guess. I don't want to have to pull hard. Also, I like flavorless juice. I never liked any flavor that I tried that's out there, they all leave a weird aftertaste in my mouth and most are super sweet. With this, I can buy flavorless juices with whatever nicotine content I want. I started with 18mg so they vape would be "better" than cigs. I still currently vape 3mg, sometimes 6mg. Before my relapse several montha ago I was mixing 0mg with 3, just when I "needed" it, like when I'm drinking or around other vapers or smokers.
p307
aVExactly. Everyone was telling me, "bro pick up a juul". But its the act of smoking in itself that is equally as addictive as the nicotine. What also helps is stepping outside like you would have a cigarette/vape and take some breaths of fresh air. Take your break outside just dont smoke. That break feeling really helps too.
p308
aVI\u2019ve actually been juuling for awhile now and it was really easy to switch from cigs to vape but I\u2019m definitely more addicted to the high nicotine in juul pods than I was with cigs. How long did it take for you to start to feel normal again?
p309
aVI honestly don't remember. I bought a 30-40 dollar vape from a local vape store. I figured that buying 50 bucks worth of vape stuff wouldn't matter in the long run in savings. Dont buy the JUUL or other brands that are pre-packaged. Buy a vape pen that you put liquid in yourself. It's more expensive, but the $3,900 I've saved since then doesn't mind much.:)
p310
aVI did the exact thing you\u2019re doing. Stopped smoking started JUULing. It was great but I felt way more addicted to nicotine. So I quit. I was straight up mad for 2 day, then sad 2 day, then felt ok. I\u2019m going on 2 weeks now and cravings are there but so small and short that you forget about them. Still getting cravings though. Hopefully they go away after awhile and I can put this all behind me. I smoked for 10 years, a pack a day. 
p311
aVi'll just say this, i had to get 5 teeth extracted and found myself smoking through my god damn nose at a bar high as fuck on oxies to avoid getting a dry socket.  at a certain point, addicts like us need to understand that we are literally willing to do anything for a fix, short term satisfaction, than to deal with the temporary discomfort of getting through healing and recovery.  \u000a\u000ait isn't about the juul, the nicotine, the physical urge for the buzz.  we need to find ways of distracting ourselves.  download tetris, make yourself a cup of tea, cut your toenails, think about how ridiculous your nose will look if you continue being a fiend, etc.  there are other alternatives; an endless amount of alternatives to nicotine.  you need to ask yourself, am i looking for a substitute chemical or a new behavior?

p313
aVHey bro I know this is a bit late but you\u2019re not alone.\u000aI\u2019ve suffered terrible panic attacks and have had derealization/depersonalization since I was about 12. \u000aI\u2019m 19 now and turning 20 in August and I had always experimented with nicotine such as dip and vapes starting at age 14 but did not become addicted until last year.\u000aAfter a year of using a disgusting amount of nicotine often times smoking a cigar a day along with going through 1 to 2 juul pods on top of that and sometimes some dip thrown In for good measure my girlfriend found all my stuff on June 25th and I vowed to quit.\u000a\u000aWell dude let me tell you, I was not prepared for the two week constant panic attack and horrible brain fog and derealization that followed.\u000aI constantly went to the e.r thinking something was wrong with me and was on the verge of believing I was going insane everyday.\u000a\u000aFinally, after a bit over two weeks I accepted that this was indeed just nicotine withdrawal. \u000aIt is my first day of week three and the brain fog and derealization is about 60% better and so is the anxiety. I know it\u2019s scary but you have to power through it, grit your teeth and do whatever you can to make it through and you will be able to do this, you\u2019re not alone and you\u2019re stronger than you think. Put your mind to the test and beat this horrible addiction and don\u2019t look back.\u000a\u000aAll studies I\u2019ve read said it takes six weeks for your brain chemistry to normalize after you quit smoking and dude I believe it. With my rate of progress I would say me being back to normal in another three weeks sounds about right. \u000a\u000aDon\u2019t be afraid to book an appointment with your psychiatrist to help you manage and don\u2019t get into the pattern of letting your panic attacks control you because then they will follow you long after the withdrawal has gone. 
p314
aVHaven't had a cigarette in over a month. I smoke my Juul daily tho. Does it count?
p315
aVI think you\u2019re still considered a smoker while you inhale any form of nicotine, I might be wrong though, if you plan on quitting 100% then the Juul will only prolong the addiction like any nicotine replacement does.
p316
aVF that. You are a non smoker!!! No more trips to the gas station. No more standing in the rain, cold, heat just to smoke a cigarette. No more smelling like an ashtray. No more planning your day around your smoke breaks. The Juul has done so much for me and I'm so thankful for it. Worry about the Juul in the future. Just stay strong and never smoke a cigarette again. Plus I guess technically you are vaping with a Juul and not smoking so by definition you are not a smoker. Congrats on quitting. You are definitely a non-smoker
p317
aVI just started using Juul two days ago and it helped me. 
p318
aVBut why quit the JUUL? Just vape. 
p319
aVQuit tobacco 120 days ago today, but hooked on Juul right now. Any tips on breaking the habit for good?
p320
aVI'm in the same boat about 3 weeks in, Juul Has to be not as bad a cigs... But it is easier to quit... That's the gambit you and I are playing, at this point it's just gotta be... You forget to charge it one night... See how long you can go without the charge then just progressively use it less and less... I mean the end goal is to quit right? I'm with you on this, these techniques are starting to work for me as well\u000a\u000aAnother thing I've been doing, is Juul is very easy to use because you can use it in your house.. Just never hit it for pleasure, just when you feel the chemical imbalance. Everytime you bring it up to your mouth you have to have the goal that you are going to quit, our brains are elastic and if you keep telling your self this it will eventually start to be true! 
p321
aVI love my Juul. MyBlu will help in a bind too.
p322
aVThe Blu's are like $1. Juul's too but a stater pack is like $50
p323
aVJust picked up a Juul and am on day 4 of no smoking. I've been going through a pod every 2 days but it seems like I am starting to vape more. I'm scared of getting MORE addicted to nicotine with these high nicotine vapes. Whats your average pod use?
p324
aVI go through about the same. The way I see it is that I am no longer smoking cigs with tar and other super harmful chemicals, so it works for now. I plan on stopping the Juul soon though. For me, I have already noticed my smokers cough went away and my teeth are white again! YAY! (For reference, I was a pack a day smoker for over 10 years, so this is a huge improvement for me). As long you know that you wont vape forever, I think that's the best attitude to have. I've tried cold turkey, patches, gum etc, but the Juul is the only thing that had curbed my cravings and kept me successful in not smoking actual cigs. Good luck friend. You can do it!
p325
aVA couple of tries ago, I tried to stop smoking by using a Juul. Big mistake! I think if you are going to quit, it should be from vaping, juuling, etc., as well. True, you are dropping the tobacco, but you are still inhaling nicotine and other substances. They haven't been around long enough to know the long term effects. Even though you are getting nicotine and other stuff with vaping, you are not getting the same out of it because there is much more to smoking than we initially think about. There's the lighter. There's the act of lighting a cigarette and then watching it burn away as you smoke it. You don't' get that from vaping. Good luck to you! I know you can do it!  
p326
aVI had that issue too. THis time i'm sticking with pod system vapes like the Juul. I just buy replacement pods at the gas station and dont have to worry about juices coils etc etc.. So far so good.
p327
aVDitch the Juul. Those things are full of nicotine, so every time you hit it you're setting yourself back. Either use patch, gum, or lozenges, or get a low nicotine level vape to take the edge off.
p328
aVOk, but doesn\u2019t the gum losenges etc have nicotine as well? I went for the juul because of the notion of puffing it more than anything. Where would I find a low level vape? The juul says it\u2019s 5%. How much lower should I be looking for?
p329
aVGum, lozenges, and the patch all have nicotine in them. That's why they're called nicotine replacement therapy. The idea behind them though is that they have less nicotine than a cigarette, and you are breaking the mental habit of smoking, even while you are still getting nicotine into your body. They also have levels of nicotine that you can select from, so you can step down the amount of nicotine that you're using. \u000a\u000aVaping with regular juice allows this also, though it does nothing for the mental habit. You can select how much nicotine is in the juice that you use. The problem with the Juul is that you really can't change the nicotine level, and the nicotine level is extremely high. \u000a\u000aThis means that when using the Juul you are still puffing on something, reinforcing your mental habit, and you are still getting similar levels of nicotine, maintaining your physical addiction. In essence, a Juul is literally nothing more than a electronic cigarette and you are still smoking. Granted, your aren't getting the tar, ammonia, and other nasty chemicals that a cigarette would give you, but you're not doing anything to help you with either. \u000a\u000aNow, let's compare a Juul to regular vape. You said that a Juul had 5% nicotine, but that's not how regular vape is measured. It is measured in mg of nicotine per ml of juice. I had to look it up, but apparently the Juul is 59mg/ml. I used vape to get me through the quitting process, but I started with 9mg/ml, then stepped down to 6mg/ml, then 3mg/ml, then 0mg/ml. \u000a\u000aLet's compare the two. When I was vaping, I was using about 5ml of juice a day. That means that at the worst I was using 45mg of nicotine a day, and on the 3mg juice, only 15mg of nicotine per day. By contrast, the same amount of Juul would give you 295mg of nicotine per day. There's also the fact that I was stepping down my nicotine levels so that after about a month I was only getting 15mg per day, whereas that isn't an option with the Juul and after a month you'll still be getting 295mg per day. \u000a\u000aHopefully this all makes sense. Essentially, I don't see how the Juul can be considered a quit smoking tool any more than switching from cigarettes to dip is. It is just changing out one delivery method for another. \u000a\u000a**Side note:** It is my understanding that there are ways to modify a Juul so that it gives less nicotine, but...\u000a\u000a1) real people aren't going to modify their Juul, they're going to use it the way it came. \u000a2) even if you modify the Juul, it still starts at 59mg, which is extremely high. \u000a\u000aBecause of these factors, I willfully ignore the ideas of modifying the Juul and still reject it as a method of quitting. 
p330
aVWow, that\u2019s awesome information. I understand everything you\u2019re saying. I\u2019ve heard of nicotine levels in e cigs and always thought the average was 3-18mg. When I saw Juul bad 5 I figured it was on the low end. I understand now that it\u2019s just labeled differently. I\u2019ll ditch it then. Do you have any recommendations for ecigs that are lower nicotine? 
p331
aVi got a juul and it has been incredible. i bought a regular vaporizer but it didn\u2019t really help with the craving for a cigarette, so then i was doing both. juul is great because it\u2019s discreet, doesn\u2019t leave huge vapor clouds everywhere and delivers the nicotine you\u2019re craving. most importantly it draws like a cigarette and has a throat hit like a cigarette. i have smoked a few since getting the juul and i haven\u2019t enjoyed them at all. give yourself a week or two on the juul and maybe you\u2019ll be lucky like me. most successful i\u2019ve been at not buying cigarettes in ten years, and i have no plans to buy more. \u000a\u000aTL;DR: the juul has helped me immensely and was a great way for me to quit. 
p332
aVVaping is a good way to avoid cigs, but the one drawback is that you WILL use the vape A LOT. It doesn\u2019t stink, you can do it nearly anywhere, and it feels better on the lungs. I got a Juul and it kept me from cigs but my nicotine dependence skyrocketed because it was so easy to use it all the time. \u000a\u000aI would highly recommend checking out ZYN tobacco free nicotine pouches. It\u2019s a little pouch that you tuck under your upper lip and after it flattens out it\u2019s virtually unnoticeable. It\u2019s not like dip or chew either, you don\u2019t have to spit or anything. It delivers a satisfactory nicotine hit. \u000a\u000aI like ZYN because you\u2019re not inhaling anything, you get a rockin buzz, it\u2019s as discrete as you can get, it\u2019s very reasonably priced, and, most importantly, it\u2019s super easy to moderate your consumption. \u000a\u000aCheck out ZYN. It\u2019s really great. It\u2019ll do your lungs a favor, and because it\u2019s tobacco free it doesn\u2019t make your teeth yellow or anything like that. It has helped me not smoke or vape and has helped me reduce nicotine intake by boatloads.\u000a[ZYN website!!](https://zyn.com/find) 
p333
aVNope absolutely not. \u000aIf you have your addiction/tolerance very low then yes weaning off is VERY easy with vaping.\u000a\u000aVaping has its own addictiveness however because you can do it anywhere. I vaped more then I smoked so I threw out my juul. WHICH BTW IS MORE ADDICTIVE. Then bought customizable juices, I am now smoke free but have a problem with oral fixations.\u000a
p334
aVIf you went with a Juul you could get some non nicotine pods as well. There are some at [https://cyclonepods.com](https://cyclonepods.com/). Best of luck quitting cigarettes and nicotine!
p335
aVi got a juul to help with cravings of oral fixation and nicotine. gum is great too. 
p336
aVIts true, yankees stadium doesnt allow it, nor does prudential center in newark, who used to have an outdoor deck for smoking. I juul now so i can just do it discreetly or goto the bathroom and take a few pulls. quitting this thing might be harder than cigs, but thanks to the juul i havent had a cig since beginning of January. 
p337
aVBear in mind that the Juul is healthier than cigarettes, not healthy. You should work toward being free from the dependence on nicotine. Getting off of cigarettes is a great first step though, do congrats on that. 
p338
aVanyone having issues with those damn JUULs
p339
aVFirst things first, talk to your friend and tell him you appreciate his generosity (seriously, JUUL pods are expensive, when I used mine I def didn't share) and tell him you're staying away from nic. When you're hanging around friends, I'd consider bringing a setup with 0mg in it so you're not tempted to use their stuff. \u000a\u000aTrust me, I feel your pain. Quit vaping almost two months ago. My fiance vapes a JUUL type device and I work in the industry, so all of my co-workers vape. I can't escape it. 0mg is the only thing that gets me through. 
p340
aVYeah, im 6 hours into quitting my juul. It is a crippling addiction, can confirm. No, you just gotta stop hitting it? I thought you quit 3 months ago? 
p341
aVThat's hard. Quitting is hard. And for everyone it might be a little different.  Maybe, finding some sort of NRT like the JUUL so that when you are out with friends and they are smoking you can technically join them but just vape instead.  It does sound good that your friends are amazed that you stopped. Maybe find something you love more than smoking and remind yourself of it as much as possible.  Also the Smoke Free app has helped me ALOT.  Keep coming back to this sub. fellow quitters are always a huge help to me. It's hard, one of the hardest things I've ever done.  I'm only on day 6.
p342
aVHey! First of all, congratulations on your decision to quit. Second, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve gotten this suggestion, but I got a juul and have hardly ever picked up a cigarette (I was a pack a day, most I\u2019ll pick up a smoke now is once or twice a month socially\u2014 and can\u2019t even finish them) ever since. Highly recommend! 
p343
aVI didnt experience the waking up so often, as much as I did irritability and stuff. Honestly what helped me was just eating more, or exercising. Any type. Take long walks through nice parks, walk your dog for an hour if you have one, stop focusing on the cig! I know it\u2019s waaaay easier said than done, but remember that most often, cravings pass within a few minutes. I try to associate quitting with a positive thing in my life. For example, treat yourself to ice cream for your effort, or enjoy a nice home cooked meal, try drinking lots of water, convince yourself in your mind that you are NOT a smoker, just someone who smoked cigarettes, but now you\u2019re done with that part of your life. The toughest fight is the mental aspect. Distractions, distractions. Eventually the cravings will get smaller and fewer between, and if you keep up with exercising or eating healthier, your body will literally cringe at the thought, sight, and smell of others smoking, because you\u2019re not a smoker, just someone who tried it for some time, and realized it wasnt for you. Sleepless nights, ambient sounds helped me fall asleep (Rain, Thunderstorms, Forest sounds) whatever you like, commit to it. You got this, and you CAN do this!! 2.5 months smoke free and so fucking proud :) and worst case, a vape/juul is not the worst thing in the world to transition to a smoke free life. I juuled for the first month transitioning, and then weened myself off that. The goal is smoke free, the path does not matter. Stay strong \u2764\ufe0f\U0001f64f\U0001f3fc\U0001f919\U0001f3fc

aVJuul Habit
p345
aVPeople can make fun all they want but the fact of the matter is that I was addicted to nicotine and chose to stop. I started with the juul in college and later got a suorin on 50mg of nic. Loved the fucking thing but it had to go
p346
aVI\u2019m not really experiencing much stress. Last night I was walking my dog up and down the boardwalk at the beach and I really considered buying a pack of cigs or a juul. The juul was 60 dollars plus another 18 for a pack of pods I was not gonna fucking do that. So I kept thinking about buying a pack of cigs, didn\u2019t wanna buy a whole pack so I was considering bumming one off a random person. I ended up doing nothing and just went to bed
p347
aVThrew my Juul away
p348
aVFor someone who smokes a pack a day (so not worried about nicotine increasing haha) would you recommend the juul for quitting? It seems really promising but is it close enough to an actual cigarette to curb the cravings?
p349
aVYeah man. The juul is super satisfying, it had a ridiculous amount of nicotine so one rip off of it strikes your throat super harshly, and then you get that buzz we all crave. Would definitely recommend, nothing comes as close as the juul to emulating cigs &amp; why we smoke cigs. If you have any questions about it pm me good luck my man.
p350
aVCool man. Mint is my favorite flavor, it\u2019s really refreshing, if you smoke menthol cigs try mint menthol, &amp; if you\u2019re trying to emulate cigs as much as possible get tobacco. Don\u2019t waste your time with the other flavors imo, definitely not made for smokers. Needless to say, vape will never perfectly emulate the feeling of a cig, but the juul has its own sort of satisfaction that is really easy to replace cigs with. I really think you can do this man. Good luck, I\u2019m rooting for you. Feel welcome to pm me your progress/what you think about the juul if you think it\u2019d help you quit. Have a good night friend.
p351
aVI quit smoking 14 days ago. Picked up a juul and have found it to be extremely helpful for quitting cigarettes. Don\u2019t think I could have gotten this far without it. Switched to a lower nicotine % today. GL :)
p352
aVI used to smoke pack a day. Quit cold turkey with JUUL. Bought a 30 ml saltnic and refilling the pods (juul pods are expensive)
p353
aVBuy a Juul man don\u2019t smoke those cigarettes. We\u2019re addicted to nicotine, that I can\u2019t deny. When you puff on the juul it disassociates the physical cigarette from getting your nicotine fix. You can now associate all the negatives with an actual cigarette, smells terrible, bad breath, the constant wasting of money, flipping out when you can\u2019t find a lighter, etc etc.  \u000aThe juul has made it so I don\u2019t need a cigarette anymore. And I puff this thing far less than I used to smoke cigarettes. It\u2019s a way to ween off without becoming an asshole. Because believe me I turned into a hot tempered irritable asshole every time I tried quitting in the past as well. I\u2019m only on day 7 but the juul has made putting down the cigarettes much easier.
p354
aVI just ordered a Juul! The only time that I successfully quit smoking cigarettes was when vaping. I didn\u2019t have a cigarette for two years. That\u2019s saying a lot from someone who has had a pack a day addiction for 22 years. 
p355
aVI love mine. I haven't had a cigarette for several months, although I wasn't intending to quit. The Juul phased out the habit naturally after a few weeks of doing both. I just really enjoyed the mint flavor (it turns out I don't like the flavor of tobacco at all), not smelling like ass, not having to brush my teeth and wash my hands constantly, not having to stand outside in the cold/wind/rain/heat, not having to stop at the store constantly, etc. \u000a\u000aI had purchased a brand new pack right before I stopped, which I had been keeping in my car "just in case". Yesterday, I gave the pack to a homeless man who asked if I had any cigarettes. I feel 100% lighter now that they are gone. Good luck to you!
p356
aVI know everyone here is telling you to not consume nicotine ever again and you should definitely try that no matter what. \u000a\u000aBut if for some reason that doesn't work and I'm not talking about giving up on that method of you fail a few times. I'm taking about when you fail and relapse hard on cigarettes, think about getting a vape . You would be surprised by how much of you addiction comes from the habit of smoking something and not the nicotine . \u000a\u000aI started with the 6mg nicotine for one week and then switched to 3mg nicotine for 3 weeks. After switching to vaping I found it way nicer to hit than a cigarette so if my friend ever offered me a cig again I would just be like nah I got my vape. But this past weekend I traveled out of state and forgot to take my vape. I was worried I would get withdrawals but surprisingly three days went back and no withdrawals. I started vaping 0mg nicotine now just to get the feeling of smoking. But I can sense that habit slowly dying in me.\u000a\u000aOne thing to note: please don't get the juul or any of those tiny low key vape mods that look like pencils. Do your research and get a proper mod. The flavor and the vapor buildup will make you realise how much more enjoyable it is to vape. Also investing in a proper vape will make you stop buying cigs for a while anyways.
p357
aVI quit juuling 3 days ago. First two days were VERY rough but it seems to have gotten better from there. I felt a sudden change when the nicotine completely cleared out around this morning. Cravings are rarely occurring (coming from every hour on the first day) and the withdrawals are almost gone. 
p358
aVI had to google juuling, I\u2019ve never heard of it before. They describe it as stronger than the usual ecig (I used 20mg) so fair play to you for managing 3 days so far. I had 2 patches left so I\u2019m using those to get the nicotine while I get used to not vaping. Nervous about going patch free tomorrow, but I\u2019ve wasted so much of my life on this addiction, I don\u2019t want to waste any more time and money. 
p359
aVSo you took vaping up as a cigarette replacement and have now been able to quit vaping? Nice! \u000a\u000aWould you happen to have any suggestions for a vape? I don\u2019t really know much about them. The only ones I\u2019m really familiar with are Juuls. They just seem like a lot less work then your standard vape that requires you to carry liquid with you every where you go. 
p360
aVHey! Congrats on trying to quit and get off it. Only if you have already purchased a Juul but there are some non nicotine pods you can use to help taper off the addicition. The store is at [https://cyclonepods.com](https://cyclonepods.com/). Best of luck on quitting! 
p361
aVTrying to quit Juuling, 26 hours!
p362
aVYou've made a smart decision. There are many forms of nicotine addiction and Juul gives you a lot of nicotine.\u000a\u000aAfter 72 hours, your body will be free of nicotine and the most intense part of physical withdrawal with be in the past. Hang in there. \u000a\u000aThese daily quit smoking lessons from Joel Spitzer really helped me. http://whyquit.com/joel/dayone.htm#dqlg
p363
aVI'm at almost 2 months now using the juul. I don't think any nicotine replacement should be frowned upon because I feel so much better now than when I was smoking. In fact, my nicotine use probably went up from what it was when I first started using the juul, but the fact that you aren't inhaling tar makes all the difference. Be proud of yourself however you manage to quit. Of course ending nicotine use altogether is the ultimate goal, but focus on one problem at a time; smoking first. Keep it up!
p364
aVYeah, I\u2019m not entirely certain how the nicotine mg stuff works yet. To my understanding at least, I have an enclosed system similar to a juul that is like 4.5% nicotine per pod, which is a whole hell of a lot. I\u2019m still trying to use this thing sparingly, but the cravings have gotten pretty intense recently. After I make my way through the remaining pods I have, I think I\u2019m going to look into getting a device where I can control nicotine content and wean myself down (this particular device only has pods at 4.5% nicotine).\u000a\u000aBut congrats to you for going as long as you have without analog cigarettes! I\u2019m heading into day 2 and I\u2019m feeling better than ever (minus some typical aches and pain type stuff, haha)
p365
aVWorks for some but not all, good on you for having that willpower and a healthy mindset to do so! Have you ever tried a vape? The juuls at several gas stations have helped many kick the habit of cigarettes. It gets expensive though so it\u2019s meant for short term In my opinion

aVJuul has quite a lot more nicotine than cigarettes, so you may be digging yourself deeper into addiction, rather than quitting.
p367
aVBest of luck to you. I've tried to give myself the same loophole in the past and all I did was obsess about that one cig everyday. But, maybe the Juul +1 plan will work out for you. \u000a\u000aAs the saying goes, "Every man must get to heaven his own way."
p368
aVI haven\u2019t had any problems with it so far. It seems the community is rather strongly opposed to the Juul in any way, but if it gets the tobacco out of my lungs, that\u2019s a pretty good start. 
p369
aVGotcha. You didn\u2019t distinguish between cancer and heart disease risks. \u000a\u000aAnd PS - I see nothing wrong with the Juul. Whatever works for you.
p370
aVI see. Most of the people who come here are looking for support to quit all forms of nicotine addition. Some come because they are addicted to Juul and want to quit. 
p371
aVIt's not a matter of being strongly oppose to Juul. This is a stop smoking community. To be frank, I don't know what you're trying to achieve. Are you trying to switch from cigarettes to vaping? Because that's a completely different subreddit than quitting smoking. 
p372
aVm00n- I'm stopping today as well. I am 20, I've been juuling for 2 years, and it stops now. Hold me accountable, I'll hold you accountable. Let's take it one day at a time. I'm feeling my first withdrawl as I write this!
p373
aVGood luck. I hope you conquer your addiction.  Why did you start using the JUUL after being free for so long? I don't know anything about ecigs or vapes of any kind. 
p374
aVYesterday was day 1 of no juul for me 
p375
aVOne month ago I would have told you that I had accepted I would die from lung cancer because there is no way I could ever quit. But 4 days ago I had this weird aha moment mid-cig and quit at noon that day without any prior planning. It has been a lot easier than previous attempts to quit for some reason. Using Juul ecig (Godsend) and Nicorette gum to manage cravings. Longest I\u2019ve been without a cig in 10+ years. Feeling optimistic :)
p376
aVYes, I bought the Juul and think it really helps so far. I totally plan to wean off of this as well.
p377
aVWas primarily using the 5% pods for Juul, the only size/amount available at my worst vaping through one pod a day. For perspective I was at worst a half pack a day smoker when I smoked. I\u2019m no math guy, so I don\u2019t know the difference. I\u2019m going to give it a couple more days then start to worry if symptoms don\u2019t subside.
p378
aVYou might be allergic to PG or VG? Idk how a juul works but if it uses coils you may be allergic to Kanthal or whatever metal it uses. Besides that I can\u2019t think of what else would be the issue barring underlying stuff that just get triggered by vaping.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m also not a doctor 
p379
aVYou're vaping from the Juul which contains nicotine salts, which is a far more potent form of nicotine.\u000a\u000aI would look up nicotine salt withdrawal, half the people I see smoking those things use it for the head buzz, which I find ridiculous but seems to be the new fad in my area.
p380
aVOne Juul pod is equivalent to one pack of cigarettes. Juul juice is 59mg nic. So yes, your withdrawal would suck the first three days until the nic is out of your system. Now you\u2019re battling the mental habit stage. Isn\u2019t it fun? Lol. It\u2019s so worth it, though. It\u2019ll get better. Hang in there. Proud of you.
p381
aVJuul
p382
aVJUULS are great, I have one too. However I am wanting to get a Sourin only because you can buy different juices for the Sourin with a lower Nic content 
p383
aVThe problem I see with the JUUL is that there isn't a way to change the nicotine level in the vape. No denying it's better for you than cigarettes, but it's still a nicotine addiction, and I seriously doubt that breathing anything other than air into your lungs on a regular basis is harmless. We just have no idea what the long term effects are of vaping yet.\u000a\u000aI think that vaping is a legitimate way to quit smoking, but I'd recommend looking into a form of vape that offers control over how much nicotine you get.
p384
aVCongrats! How long did it take you to quit the e-cig? I\u2019ve had my juul almost 2 months and to be honest I smoke it more than I ever smoked cigs, However I can count on 1 hand how many cigarettes I\u2019ve had since the switch but want to know your journey. 
p385
aVI was using the juul, too. I got my juul in December of last year after being unable to quit cigarettes cold turkey. I stupidly thought that it was going to help since \u201ceveryone uses it.\u201d I was going through two pods a day. For comparison, I used to smoke a pack or two of cigarettes a day.  I would juul from sun up to sun down. I honestly think it was terrible for me to ever purchase it. That\u2019s how I realized what a monster nicotine is. This week of quitting has shown me how badly smoking was hurting me. My sinuses have been absolutely killing me and I have near-constant headaches. I recommend trying to quit if you can. If you need a friend or any tips, feel free to PM me. I\u2019m going through the same thing. 
p386
aVA Juul
p387
aVGood for you! I went from cigarettes to a juul to a little refillable sourin air. I\u2019m going to start cutting out nic as soon as the current bottle of juice I have is empty. I\u2019m pretty excited to give it a try
p388
aVCongrats. The benefits you mentioned are awesome! I'm only 12 days of smoke free and i can feel the gain. \u000a\u000aBut i am feeling really empty. I dont use anything. I just cold turkey and dont use any nic product. Do you recommend me Juul? I will not going to smoke a cig for sure but i want that 'throat hit' . 
p389
aVYou got this! I spent 6 months addicted to the Juul. I got a positive pregnancy test and they immediately went into the electronics recycling bin (hopefully that was the right place to dispose of it). It\u2019s been 4 weeks nicotine free (9.5w pregnant)! Apparently the only time I can quit is when I\u2019m pregnant, but this is my last pregnancy, so I really have to make this the final goodbye. Stay strong, my friend!
p390
aVThis is awesome to see - congrats! I just quit about a month ago and my Juul has been incredible for cravings (not to mention how deliciously minty it tastes in comparison to a nasty cigarette). I\u2019m still in the process of weaning myself off of this - but you\u2019re giving me hope that I\u2019ll be able to do it soon. Keep up the progress :)
p391
aVNo nic at all?  Don\u2019t juul whatever ya do lol
p392
aVAlmost 24 hours. YAY ME! But, using the Juul to get me through has me feeling guilty..
p393
aVYou're still addicted to nicotine, but you aren't getting all of the other, burning leaves, downsides. I'm not a fan of the JUUL because you can adjust the nicotine you're receiving to help work your way down, but it's better than smoking. Small wins. 
p394
aVJust quit vaping also, my juul broke and i was going to just buy another kit since it usually  was only $20, however when i went to the gas ststion to buy another it ended up being $50... i just said screw that i think its time to quit and now im here 4 days later. Still kind of feeling crappy however i'm still going strong. I could have bought some cigs, but i REALLY did not feel like withdrawing from those again too..Keep up the good work man
p395
aVIt's got to be at least a little better than smoking though right? It's gonna be a lot harder to quit this thing than cigarettes, and I've already sunk so much money into it. I think for now I'm just going to enjoy being a non smoker and hope I can taper my Juul habit into something a little healthier and more affordable over time.
p396
aVDefinitely get off the nicotine ASAP, some people have tried using these non nicotine pods to help quit. Good flavor and totally work with Juul. The store is at r/https://cyclonepods.com. Best of luck
p397
aVI know this isn\u2019t a vape forum but a lot of cigarette smokers I know quit thanks to vaping. A lot of them like the Juul cause it gives a throat hit like cigs and a very strong buzz. Try it out, life is too short for tar in the lungs
p398
aVHey, we have some non nicotine Juul compatible pods that you may be interested in. These pods can probably help with that. The store is at [https://cyclonepods.com/](https://cyclonepods.com/). Best of luck!
p399
aVThe juul helped me quit. Over 5 months without a cigarette from a pack a day for years. Be strong. 
p400
aVVaping is better than smoking. I'm not a fan of the JUUL because they're good in nicotine and you have no control over the level in them. Maybe consider a regular vape with juice you can control. Either way, hang in there, you can do it. 
p401
aVlol wot "juuls 4 tots"\u000a \u000athat shit is fucked up. You should focus on selling to people in countries that have banned vaping or E-juice/nicotine.\u000a \u000aBtw if anyone wanted to find you I bet you didn't have the foresight to obscure your IP when you posted here to Reddit so I'd do yourself a favor and delete this since it's obvious you didn't find this trash .onion link randomly and decided to post here lol \u000a \u000aDouble btw: Your shit tier HTML page is using Google Analytics, why? lmao did your Intro to Web Design prof make you like your first pages to it?\u000a \u000aSPAMMING THIS ON ALL YOUR POSTS AND ILL BUILD A BOT TO DO IT IF YOU DONT DELETE THIS ACCOUNT AND POSTS.
p402
aVHonestly that's a good point. I've been smoking cigarettes for a couple of months, but I was juuling before that. Should I just return the vape? The thought of being over this so soon is very appealing. 
p403
aVSo you've been using a Juul too? That makes a difference, I assumed you were just smoking cigarettes only. Depending on how long and how often you've been using the Juul, it could be worse. I'd recommend that you try to get off of nicotine completely. You can use gum or patches, but you really need to just get off of it all together and claim your life back. The longer you avoid quitting, the worse the quit will get.\u000a\u000aOne way or another, just make yourself a promise that you will never smoke another cigarette. It isn't cool to be addicted to nicotine, but getting nicotine from a Juul or vape is \u005c*\u005c*way\u005c*\u005c* better than smoking cigarettes. Vape may or may not cause you issues down the road, but anyone who has smoked and vaped can tell you that vape isn't even in the same league as smoking when it comes to "bad for you".
p404
aVI've only been Juuling since January, so maybe the quit won't be too bad still. I don't juul in addition to smoking; it's always been one or the other and I haven't juuled since I started smoking. I think I'm going to return the vape tomorrow and just go cold turkey. The longer I go, absolutely the worse it will be. Congrats on 48 days by the way, that's incredible, and thanks for the advice. 
p405
aVI quit 2 weeks ago, and I\u2019ve been using a Juul to help with cravings. Juul liquid is 5%, but it\u2019s fairly concentrated and gives a nice buzz. Since I still have access to nicotine, I still don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve completely \u201cquit\u201d  the addiction yet. I\u2019m going to start weaning myself off in about a month or so. However it\u2019s been helping me quite a bit. Best of luck :) 
p406
aVDecided on the patch/gum to see how it goes first, if it doesn't make me quit I might try a vape and I'll keep Juul in mind thanks a lot.
p407
aVI\u2019m almost three days in. I hit one of those fucking JUUL pods, 1 hit because the temptation was killing me. From that one hit I got a little buzz. And now, I hate myself. Did that stupid hit completely fuck up my journey. I am extremely disappointed in myself. This stupid nicotine monster inside me is unreal. So strong and so tempting.\u000a
p408
aVDon\u2019t do it. Get a vape or a juul\u000aYour mind is playing tricks on you! \u000aTwo days=your body is almost free of the toxins/nicotine 
p409
aVIsn't the vape or juul (I'm assuming you mean the disposable ones at the gas station) isn't that just as bad?
p410
aVHey there from the States! I started smoking (what some Americans refer to as) moles when I was seventeen. Started slow and before I knew it I was smoking 10+ a day. Trying to skip out of work just to sit in my room and mole. I quit three months ago shorty after turning twenty two. Black spirits is all I used. I was and still am very ashamed that I even got myself into it. Here is what I used to quit tobacco. \u000a\u000a1. You have to want it. You really have to want to quit. I use a Juul for now and I'll get to that in a second but nothing will replace the feeling. Just know it will get better. \u000a\u000a\u000a2. Find someone who also wants to quit. I quit with my friends and I think that played a huge role. \u000a\u000a\u000a3. Find a vape for now that will help will the nicotine withdraw. Don't listen to people who say it's harmful it is 1000x better than cigs. And it will be much easier to quit a vape. \u000a\u000a\u000a4. Do not give up no matter what. If you fail, start again and again until you succeed. And believe me if I did it and all of my friend's did, I promise you can too.

p412
aVI am ALSO on day 4 cold turkey! \u000a\u000aSo nice to know someone is on my similar path. I went from splifs--&gt;cigarrettes--&gt;juul (e-cig) and I am emotionally done with this shit. Keep up the good work. 
p413
aVThe JUUL is keeping the stress away. I\u2019ve read that it has to do with your mouth becoming more acidic after quitting cigarettes. Do you still get them regularly?
p414
aVNice, I don't know much about JUUL, does it help with tapering? \u000a\u000aThat makes sense I guess. I only get them if I'm super stressed or I have more than like 4 alcoholic drinks in a week. 
p415
aVStress definitely causes canker sores for sure, I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s the reason I\u2019m getting them at the moment. JUUL is just an e cig, it helps because of the nicotine 
p416
aVYup same here. I started smoking cigarettes when I wasn\u2019t getting the buzz from vaping anymore. It didn\u2019t help that vapes are unreliable and always break whereas cigarettes don\u2019t. I recently quit cigs and now I\u2019m weening off the nicotine addiction with a Juul. But if I could go back in time and beat my own ass for buying that first vape, I would.
p417
aVThe Juul is the only thing that's made me actually successful in quitting in the past over 10 years. Besides a stupid 1 day, 2 cig, relapse.
p418
aVHello! I'm a college student very addicted to Juul, and who desperately wants to quit.
p419
aVOh wow we\u2019re the same! Let\u2019s cut the bullshit juul out, get them A\u2019s, fuck up the mcat, and become doctors. 
p420
aVAlthough I can't really tell you how good it is, because mine isn't going to be here until Thursday, the Juul is supposed to be a good alternative. I've never like vaping, and I want to give up nicotine for good, but I've read a lot about people switching to the Juul and then eventually putting that down too. \u000a\u000aBasically the Juul is supposed to give you a hit similar to a cigarette, in regards to feeling in your chest if you know what I mean. The only reason I mention it is because you said you were using the patches. Best of luck to you, you got this!
p421
aVI just looked 'Juul' up.  Looks interesting.  Lets us know how it works.  \u000a\u000aThanks for your support! 
p422
aVTry a juul
p423
aVThank dude, that's what I'm scared of. It's gotten to the point that the majority of the time I get a craving to use the juul I take a nap.
p424
aVhave you tried getting a juul?
p425
aV&gt; juul\u000a\u000ano, i now little about juul
p426
aVHaven't smoked cigs since new year! But can't say the same about smoking a Juul. Can't tell if I'm doing good or bad. Anyone else have similar experiences?
p427
aVJuul helped me get off cigs too but it also had negative consequences after using it for too long. I was overly stimulated at times since it has 50mg of nicotine compared to a typical vape that usually has 4-12. I\u2019m happy to hear your off cigs but be careful bc the juul can easily be just as addictive.
p428
aVQuit about 100 times cold turkey. Bought a Juul last night after another failed attempt
p429
aVGood luck to you, but I don't think the JUUL is a good way to go. From what I've heard they are actually higher in nicotine than your average cigarette, which is probably why you like it more than a cigarette, and they are not adjustable in the nicotine level without some sort of hacking being done on them.\u000a\u000aIf you really want to go this route, I would suggest trying a regular vaporizer where you can control the nicotine level in the juice, and make sure you use a low enough nicotine level that you actually experience some withdrawal, with regular reduction in the nicotine level until you get to 0mg juice.
p430
aVCongratulations - you've stopped smoking! Try to keep juul under control since it might hook you up on nicotine even more than cigarettes. Good luck! 
p431
aVJuul is super addictive, ended up tossing min out the window while driving because i was way more addicted than smoking.
p432
aV&gt; From what I've heard they are actually higher in nicotine than your average cigarette\u000a\u000aDefinitely not, a light cigarette contains 6mg of nicotine. I do see your point thought, but you must understand that the juul is pretty helpful because the nicotine content is similar to that of a cigarette. All OP has to do is moderate his use of the juul. Also, not give into each craving for a smoke. Using a regular vaporizer doesn't help most people quit cigarettes because it's doesn't feel at all like a cigarette. It just feels like a portable hookah. \u000a\u000a[One simple chart](https://ecigone.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/JUUL-E-Cigarette-Review-Nicotine-Salts.png)
p433
aVI certainly hope it works for OP and anyone else who tries to use one, but if moderating your use of the delivery mechanism worked as a way to get off of nicotine, we'd all be smoke free by now. I'm sure everyone on this sub has attempted the "cutting back on smoking" method before and found out how useless that is. If the JUUL had a way to reduce the nicotine gradually, I wouldn't have an issue with it, but from what I've seen I don't hold a lot of hope. \u000a\u000aAgain, this is just my opinion and I actually hope I'm wrong and it can lead to a full quit. If nothing else, I would say that the JUUL is better than a cigarette, so at least it's something. 
p434
aV&gt; but if moderating your use of the delivery mechanism worked as a way to get off of nicotine, we'd all be smoke free by now.\u000a\u000aFew people actively moderate it though. (I know I can't explain everyone's situation based on my own, as I'm only 3 days off cigarettes) But, thanks to the juul I haven't touched a cigarette for 3 days straight, that's the longest time without one in over 10 years. I'm killing the addiction to the act of smoking, the nicotine will take more time. I guess only time will tell, but I'm planning on being able to write in a few months that I am nicotine free. \u000a\u000a&gt;  If the JUUL had a way to reduce the nicotine gradually,\u000a\u000aYes, that would be awesome. Keep in mind that juuls slogan is basically "the adult smokers alternative to cigarettes." It was just created in 2017 with the goal to give smokers an alternative nearly equal to a cigarette. That being said, it's a fairly new product and maybe they'll focus more on getting people to quit entirely. Of course, this would be a totally separate item because I doubt they'd want to lose every customer. \u000a\u000aIt's not the perfect solution, but as someone who has smoked a cigarette every day for the past 10+ years, it feels fucking amazing to have this juul. For the past 3 days I've been able to breath and run with my dog without having to stop to cough up a long every 5 minutes. Also, I don't stink! 
p435
aV&gt; but if moderating your use of the delivery mechanism worked as a way to get off of nicotine, we'd all be smoke free by now.\u000a\u000aAlso, I have to add, this reasoning is quite flawed. I have tried the "cutting back on cigarettes and eventually quit" method. That shit did not work. I was so hooked on the entire habit of smoking and the nicotine of course. Going outside and lighting up the cigarette was just as much as my addiction than the drug itself. I'd smoke an entire cigarette and eventually for down to 3 a day. I ended up just slowly adding more cigarettes until it was back to normal. \u000a\u000aWith the juul I could just take 3 or so puffs if my craving is really bad. I don't have to go outside and so my entire "ritual" that comes along with having a cigarette. I can be in my bedroom or in my living room, or at work. Basically, it's much easier to moderate puffs off of a juul than to smoke entire cigarettes and cut back when you have a whole pack in front of you. 
p436
aVSomeone mentioned the JUUL this morning and I looked it up. Apparently, they only come in one level of nicotine, the "entire pack of cigarettes in one hit" level. You should really get off of those. Yes, you are avoiding a lot of the really bad stuff that is in an analog smoke, but remember that vaping hasn't been around for that long and hasn't been fully tested yet. There's no reason to kick one bad habit and replace it with another.\u000a\u000aStick with the quit, you can do it.
p437
aVDon't think that I'm trying to put you down for using a vape, I just don't think the JUUL is a good idea. I'm vaping to keep myself sane, so I have zero issue with vaping itself. The problem with the JUUL is the fact that they appear to actually have **more** nicotine than a cigarette, and you can't vary the level in them short of just hitting it less. \u000a\u000aThe advantage to a vape like I'm using is that the level of nicotine in the juice is adjustable, all the way down to nicotine free, and the level of nicotine that I'm at is less than I was getting with cigarettes. If you're going to use NRT to wean yourself off, you have to actually be moving in the direction of less usage. I think the lozenges are probably a good idea.\u000a\u000aGood luck, and hang in there.
p438
aVAh.. I used a JUUL. Took three years of vaping it. Quit two months ago. F\u2019in hell. I still smoke if I\u2019m with certain people. This is rare though. Like once every two months. No longer an addiction. Toughest thing is figuring out what to do in place of.. f man, my belly getting big. Imma need to cut back on munchies now... 
p439
aVHas anyone successfully quit cigarettes through JUUL, then quit the JUUL itself?
p440
aVI'm not familiar with the JUUL. Does it have varying nicotine levels? If so, gradually reduce it. \u000a\u000aPersonally, I'm vaping with 9mg juice. It isn't as strong as I'm used to with a cigarette, but it's enough to take the edge off. I'm planning to step down to 6mg, then 3mg, then 0mg. Once I'm at 0, it's all mental and I'll cut it off. Hopefully it's the right choice for me, because the only other thing I haven't tried in the past are drugs, and I'd rather not go that route if I can avoid it. 
p441
aVJuul is absolutely insane, just do some research lol. I had to toss mine.
p442
aVIt was super hard, switched to gum now i just quit the gum. Juul is stronger than actual cigarettes in my opinion.
p443
aVI smoked cigarettes for 9 years, then used a juul for about 6 months. I thought it was easier to quit after the juul as opposed to cold turkey from cigarettes
p444
aVNo the JUUL doesn't have varying nicotine but there are videos on the internet on how you can manually change it. I suggest you try it if you can't stop because I tried vaping and it didn't even come close either, but this one is made for smokers and has a really similar inhale and nic level.
p445
aVTry to remind yourself that you are quitting nicotine, not just cigarettes. I'm in the same boat and find that the best way to not end up fully hooked on the juul is all about moderation. I try to not use the juul at work. Also, you can try to not give into each craving to take puff on the juul. Maybe try every other craving, just wait it out until you get another craving. I'm only 3 days cigarette free but already feel a huge difference in my breathing. Keep it up, you can do it! 
p446
aVI'm definitely addicted to both. I'm using the juul but occasionally really miss just lighting up a cigarette and ashing, dumb shit like that. 
p447
aVI know this is an old post, but I really hope this is me. Just switched to JUUL a day ago after trying to quit cigs countless times. 
p448
aVCyclone pods are non nicotine Juul compatible pods which some people have used to help quit the Juul. Check them out at [https://cyclonepods.com/](https://cyclonepods.com/)
p449
aVDon\u2019t be a fool rip the juul
p450
aVI switched from cigarettes to a juul for a little less than half a year, the juul broke so I quit! I'm two weeks in today. Good job transitioning, I think it made it way easier for me personally   
p451
aVI got something similar, to taper off juul which got me off cigs but was more addictive tbh. I bought this little nicotine pouches from my local gas station they are like snus without tobacco just nicotine. They also are more effective than nicotine polys. found in gum because they are nicotine salts.
p452
aVTry nicotine pouches , they are sold at gas stations, its like snus without tobacco and its nicotine salt like a juul inside the pouch so it feels more effective but less harsh.
p453
aVUse low nicotine snus to taper off high nicotine vape(juul)?
p454
aVI've never used juul but is there a way to fill the pods with 0 nic juice? Might make more sense than reaching out to tobacco (snus)... 
p455
aVi bought a juul. worked for me.
p456
aVJuul

aVI know this community is very anti nicotine, but I'm going a bit unorthodox with my method. I've quit in the past, twice, but both were temporary quits due to circumstances with no intention of actually quitting and what they've taught me is that my nicotine crave isn't nearly as bad as my *cigarette* crave, if that makes sense. It's the habit. So I'm splitting this up into first getting the habit out of my system, and the Juul was the closest thing to that. Then I'll get the nic out, which isn't hard for me.\u000a\u000aIt's two days earlier than I set my deadline for but I finished my pack about 9 hours ago and figured, why not. \u000a\u000aSo far, the nicotine crave isn't there, obviously. But I *really* want a cigarette. The sizzle of burning tobacco, knowing when I'll toss the cigarette out and my little break ends, all that stuff. But I'm coping with the Juul and a lot of snacks. My pod is already halfway through, which is about half a pack, but at least I haven't had tar in 9 hours.
p458
aVHey man I got a juul too! Just bought it 2 days ago and I'm cig free currently.
p459
aVBeen juuling since new years eve.... love how i dont smell of cigs anymore
p460
aVHahaha the first time I saw a Juul I wondered the same thing (*why is that why sucking on a USB stick. Oh there's vape. Oh ok.*)
p461
aVJuul pods are crazy expensive. I\u2019d recommend getting a sourin drop and buying your own nic salts if you don\u2019t wanna break the bank
p462
aVTen days since i switched to juul. Ten days since ive had a smoke. Whatever its doing, is working.
p463
aV$16 for the equivalent of 4 packs. Where I live it's $8 a pack and where I'm moving it's  $17 a pack. Either way it's way cheaper the Juul route.
p464
aVim 3 months smoke free thanks to my juul. I still need the rush of nicotine just without all the awful side effects of smoking.
p465
aVWarning to smokers considering trying a juul and similar salt based nicotine devices.
p466
aVVaping helped me quit smoking but im tired of being addicted, just tossed my juul and I feel liberated.
p467
aVI just stopped using my Juul yesterday and now I'm 24 hours nicotine free. I'm a little jittery but I got a standard vaporizer that lets me vape nicotine free juice to keep myself occupied. My plan is\u005cwas to use Juul to break free from the social\u005croutine aspects first, then nicotine free vape for about a month to get clear of the nicotine addiction. 
p468
aVThat\u2019s the thing, I started vaping because I started to get fidgety, mood swings, difficulty concentrating... I\u2019m so mad at myself because I\u2019m trying to write a paper as we speak, and couldn\u2019t concentrate, so I just took two puffs of a JUUL, and was so mad at myself. I mean, comparatively, my normal habit is vaping from the moment I wake up (like, literally the first thing I do when I open my eyes is reach for my vape) to the moment I go to bed. Sucks that I gave in, but I\u2019m happy I stopped myself at 2, and that I waited a while before giving in... the craving is definitely still there but I satisfied my body a tiny bit so it would shut the hell up. And now I feel like I\u2019m just coming up with excuses for giving in. This sucks. Counter reset, and knowing myself I doubt it\u2019ll be the last time. But you know what, as long as the time between resetting the counter keeps getting longer and longer, I consider that progress. In all of my past attempts, me caving was me going all out and vaping for 10 minutes straight, and then continuing use as usual... not this time though, it\u2019s weird, it feels different. I\u2019ve never actually been this upset with myself for giving in, I really wanted this time to be the final time, and I gave in (albeit not as badly) so early... 19 hours... I\u2019m so weak man...
p469
aVProps. I haven\u2019t begun myself, I keep pushing it back because I feel like quitting would make my semester hell, but at some point, I have to accept that there may not be a best time, and just quit. On the other hand, it is much harder for me because I don\u2019t actually smoke cigarettes, I vape (~5 years), which presents a problem because I can hit it anywhere I\u2019d like. Not to mention the fact that pretty much everyone has a JUUL (shout out to all the idiots getting addicted to nicotine for the buzz that\u2019ll disappear in a week or two) or box mod these days, making it too easy to succumb and take a drag or two. I always feel like shit after I do. I tried quitting twice this past year, longest was 6 days, failed both times because I got drunk and my roomate succumbed to my begging for his JUUL, even though I told him not to. I ended up convincing him to quit too, though, so we\u2019re both going to do it together. I feel that may make it easier. I hate myself for ever starting, to be honest. I wanna punch 15 year old me in the face. What a dumbass. 
p470
aVDude, get a juul or some other vape. It makes quitting so much less stressful and then lowering the nicotine levels is easy when you're ready. 
p471
aVRight here w you pal. Honesty, going the vape route isn't a bad way to go. Invest in a juul or a phix and taper down from that
p472
aVHey man,\u000a\u000aI suggest dropping the nicotine down.\u000a\u000aI vaped juul for around 2 years, which is about 50mg nicotine. About two days ago, I dropped the nicotine content down to 3mg (by refilling the pods with 3mg juice, which is a **94%** decrease in nicotine from the previous amount.\u000a\u000aI was afraid it would be too much, but it isn't (this is about my 4th attempt at quitting vaping. Other times i was doing cold turkey) \u000a\u000aNot only is the flavor better, but the withdrawals are curved just enough for me. They are still there, but it's alot easier than quitting cold turkey. \u000a\u000aNot only that, but eventually cut down to 0mg juice (if you're already on 3mg). I'm going to vape 3mg nicotine for around 2 more days or so, then bump down to 0mg. The act of vaping itself (actually inhaling the vapor) is very relaxing, even with 0mg nicotine.\u000a\u000aI suggest, if you are vaping with a big box vape that blows cumulonimbus clouds, to buy something that blows smaller clouds that you can refill with less nicotine. Work your way down from there.\u000a\u000aI've been eating more, and I have a bit more energy, too. My skin feels less dry as well. The biggest withdrawal I had was brain fog (my brain felt like it didn't work yesterday, could barely think) but that's just *me*, and everyone withdrawals are different. \u000a\u000a\u000a
p473
aVI was kinda in the same boat. I ended up getting a Juul pen because someone on this sub recommended it. I\u2019ve been using it for about a week and it\u2019s been great. It doesn\u2019t produce a lot of vapor so it\u2019s discreet and I feel it\u2019s giving me enough nicotine to keep cravings at bay. I was a pack a day smoker; and each \u201cpod\u201d, which contains roughly the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes, last me about 2-2.5 days. The pods come in packs of 4 and are roughly $15-$17 a pack, depending on the flavor. It charges via usb and lasts me about a day or so per charge. \u000aPM me if you have any questions-
p474
aVQuit for 4 months my friends got me a juul
p475
aVthis sounds innocent but the problem is that you re-activate your nicotine receptors and these guys don't give a shit if you deliver the juice using a juul or by smoking. so it's a risky game. i'd suggest to ditch it.
p476
aVI\u2019m currently using the juul. It has allowed me to go down to 2 cigs a day, to now none. It\u2019s my 5 day today. I still pull on it frequently, but slowly I\u2019m gonna decrease the amount. Hopefully, I can successfully drop nicotine all together. \u000a\u000aI still feel better without all the other junk that\u2019s in cigarettes. 
p477
aVIf you don't mind the nicotine, a juul is a great and safer alternative although not harmless of course. No smell, no disgust, less lung issues. 
p478
aVcollege student here, I gave my juul to a friend. I felt the same but I\u2019ve saved 30 bucks on pods in eight days so try to justify it that way- it\u2019s hard but you\u2019ll notice the money saved
p479
aVYou're already adicted, no question. The longer you continue, the harder it will be to quit. Also, you might have wasted money on whatever the fuck a Juul is but imagine all the money you'll continue to waste if you don't quit now
p480
aVHaving problems with your juul vape or how to clean and for more information
p481
aVThere comes some maintenance with vaping. The thing that helped me quit was the Juul vape. Heres a video I made about it for information. Its also about the size of a normal cigarette so its not too obnoxious.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnEeh7Is4Fw&amp;t=1s
p482
aVFirst day of stopping JUUL
p483
aVHey guys- I'm a "new" to Reddit, though a long time lurker. I quit yesterday, but I am using the JUUL. It's still so, so hard. I made it. I did cry once lol but just woke up, day 2. I hate the empty feeling... but what I hate more is that I even have that. Who is using vaping to help?
p484
aVI am also using a juul and haven't had a cigarette in 5 weeks. Last week was a rough one but I've managed. \u000a\u000aIt gets better. \u000a\u000aI find myself not even desiring a cig because I know how gross it'l make me feel 
p485
aVHang in there I'm 38 and trying this same as you I have one kid. And looking at 40 coming up and being in the same boat as you at 30 32 34 36 up until now I can only imagine what it would be like if I had just stuck with it years ago and quit I probably wouldn't be worried about or even know what the fuck a juul was. You can do it I can do it and whoever else is reading this cigarettes suck and it sucks 2 feel like you need something all the time
p486
aVYou can do it. Your future self is thanking you right now for being strong and doing the right thing. \u000a\u000aJuul is pretty nice, mint is my favorite cuz I smoked menthols and I like the mango to switch it up every now and then.\u000a\u000aGood luck!
p487
aVHave you tried vaping? The nicotine in a Juul can be pretty fucking intense but it's been proven to be at least wayyyy healthier than smoking.
p488
aVIt's not cheating to use a JUUL (imo). I've been using a vape to cut down on smoking and have been doing both for almost a year. Today I've taken the first step and thrown my stinkies away. Vaping isn't proven to be harmless, that's true. But personally I'd rather take the risk than know I'm harming myself with cigarettes! Do what you need to do to drop your bad habit and congrats on 31 days!
p489
aVGet a juul, you won\u2019t look back. Worked since mid-Dec for me. Get off the cigs first, work on the nic later.\u000a
p490
aVas an idiot who got addicted to juul and not cigs, how have you gone about quitting vaping/nicotine only and is there really a point health wise in your opinion? I mean, i'm puffing on these good ass cucumber pods right now and on the one hand, being addicted to something is bad but on the other hand, it doesn't seem very harmful at all. I don't know, I'm 17 and these shits are everywhere, i feel like if i get rid of mine ill just be bumming off of friends for a few months and end up buying another.
p491
aVGet a vape that allows you to dial back the levels until you get it to 0. Juul is for smokers trying to stop cigs, not kids.\u000a\u000aYou have a different problem than OP.\u000a
p492
aVThis will sound counterintuitive, but lecture him LESS about smoking. Get on his was LESS. there are many ways to help someone quit, but they have to want to quit. In my previously failed attempts to quit (I'm finally doing it, but it took several attempts), friends and family preaching about how bad for you it is just made me want to light up even more. \u000a\u000aSmokers know smoking is bad for them and telling them how bad it is and not to do it is like asking someone to NOT think about a purple penguin wearing a tuxedo in an Applebees parking lot. Naturally the first thing we do is the very opposite. \u000a\u000aGet him a juul or some salt nicotine vape. They require next to no maintenance and buying new pods isn't that much more expensive than buying tobacco everyday (well the juul is a *little* more expensive in the long haul, but hopefully he will like it enough to not need to sort out the details). \u000a\u000aI wish you luck. 
p493
aVI\u2019ve got a Juul. The pods are essentially a single pack a day (5mg). I\u2019ve gone from a full pack in 24 hours to a pod every few days. Restricting your intake that way might be the answer. I\u2019m not sure what else to say except to try to get control back. 
p494
aVFirst of all.. don\u2019t be so down on yourself. Nicotine is a hell of a drug and makes you do funny things. I\u2019ve been in the same exact position as you. My brother recently told me about JUUL and I know it\u2019s a substitute but you can slowly diminish the amount of nic in it till you\u2019re free. I bought one today and it is the closest thing to dragging a cigarette I\u2019ve had. Haven\u2019t had the need or want to light one up all day. 
p495
aVYeah... the ones made by JUUL are. It\u2019s damn easy to refill with whatever you please if you do some research.
p496
aVCouldn't figure out how to have the picture and text lol.  The worst two days were the last two, I had awful itch to buy a pack when I was checking out at convenience store.  My lungs feel clearer and I've been exercising.  I use a Juul but have only really gone through a pod in two weeks so I think I'm doing well there.  Good luck to all
p497
aVGood luck. To me the vape is much more addicting than cigs although it\u2019s healthier. The reason is I can vape anywhere. I\u2019d constantly be hitting my nicotine packed Juul. \u000a\u000aIt\u2019s hard. Very. You\u2019ll notice that everything you did, literally everything, you\u2019d be vaping while doing it.\u000a\u000aWatching TV? Vaping. Computer? Vaping. Bathroom? Vaping. Driving? Vaping. Doing Schoolwork? Vaping. Just woke up? Vaping.
p498
aVI quit on the first and have been using a juul here and there. It definitely is faaarrr less damaging. I get the argument against it but I\u2019ve tried enough times without and never made it very far. I\u2019m at 2 weeks and having the juul when things get crazy or around other smokers while having a beer just makes the transition much easier and has a much higher success rate.\u000a\u000aI know I\u2019ll have to fight that too but just nicotine seems to be easier than an actual cigarette and all of the chemicals in that. \u000a\u000aSome people here view it as cheating but, I don\u2019t. I view it as an advantage.
p499
aVThe problem with a juul is the juice is very strong. I think a cartridge is as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes. And you can't buy different strengths. People find themselves as addicted to the juul as they were to cigarettes, if not more. I think it is better to get a tank system vape and you can gradually reduce the nicotine content to the ultimate goal of 0. 
p500
aVDoes using a Juul e-cigarette count?
p501
aVIMHO yes. I am attempting to quit juuls as I type this. Day 5 here. Just as hard as quitting cigarettes except you don\u2019t get all the immediate benefits that you notice when you stop breathing smoke into your lungs.\u000a\u000aOn one hand juuls are good because you\u2019re not getting the tar / smoke on the other I found myself using them way more frequently and likely increased my nicotine intake significantly. The addiction was just as strong.\u000a\u000aTLDR: If you plan to keep smoking juuls aren\u2019t bad from a harm reduction POV. If you plan on quitting, skip the juuls and just get it over with.
p502
aVDay 3 of no Juul
p503
aVGood on you! Nicotine addiction is nicotine addiction, whether it been cigs or vapes. \u000a\u000aFrom my experience with vaping, I always end up smoking more. Partly because it's basically unlimited until you run out of juice. And then I always ended up smoking cigs too because vaping just made me want a cig.\u000a\u000aMy brother has one of those and I tried it during Christmas break. I used to smoke black and milds (and inhale every puff, as embarrassing it is to say) and one small puff out of that Juul and I was coughing up a lung. I was so surprised. \u000a\u000aCongrats on making the decision to quit! We can do it!
