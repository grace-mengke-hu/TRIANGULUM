VWhat would be a good budget starter kit for a newbie?\u000a\u000aI\u2019m thinking between procolor, or a juul. If anyone have a better in the price range, that would be great!
p1
aVIm pretty used to juul and eon pods, and I\u2019m just refilling them now with 5% mix salt juice. But I\u2019m still not tolerant to the nicotine as my friends. I still get buzzed because I wait 8-12 hours and quit on the weekends. I just want to know how long I should shake it because I\u2019m waiting a long time to get buzzed, and It\u2019s still not hitting, so I think this is an issue with how long I\u2019m shaking it.

aVTheres a couple parts to a vape you should know.\u000a\u000aMod: the box/stick/etc. that you hold, it contains the battery(ies) to power the vape.\u000a\u000aTank: the glass/plastic piece on top that holds your e-liquid and atomizer.\u000a\u000aCoil: the thing inside the tank that actually creates vapor when an electrical current goes through. These two are the core part of vaping, and determine flavour, cloud production, etc.\u000a\u000aWhat you wanna buy first depends on what you're looking to get out of vaping.\u000a\u000aDo you wanna quit smoking? I'd recommend a pod system like the JUUL or the SMOK Novo. It has the parts I just described but in a really compact pod that fits in your hand. Emulates a cigarette, and is usually designed for high nicotine e-liquid to help wean off the itch for a smoke. However these have next to no customization options.\u000a\u000aA stick system, like the SMOK Stick Prince, is a bigger version of that. It's made up of a single battery stick mod, with whatever tank you want on top. This is still very portable, but now with the ability to choose what kind of tank and coils you want instead of the base ones provided in a pod.\u000a\u000aA box mod, like the Vaporesso Revenger or Voopoo Drag, is a bigger, two-battery system that looks like... well, a box. They tend comes with more advanced chipsets that let you customize a ton about the electrical side of vaping, unlike the sticks or pods. Wattage, voltage, temperature, etc. can all be changed with some box mods. These are however much bulkier (still pocket sized, I keep my Revenger on me) and the most expensive option. They are also good for rebuildable atomizers, which you'll learn about later.\u000a\u000aHit me with your questions!

aVRefillable Pod Mod Recommendations\u000a\u000aI need help with some pod mod recommendations. I have a phix, juul, sourin air, drop, and i-share, aspire breeze and also the smok fit and infinix. I wanted to know if there are any pod mods that are refillable but keep that small and sleek design like the juul. I was looking at the rubi by kandypens but it's expensive and I've heard they can break easily.
p5
aVBoulder Rock!! 2ML \u2022 360 mAh \u2022 nice thick clouds!! Got an aluminum casing USB on the bottom very slick hair thicker than the juul but the same length +\u005c- \u000a\u000a$9.95 most sites (ET) and it comes with a 10 mill American \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 Blend tobacco, and I'm telling you, it's the best tobacco ejuice I've ever tasted. It's made in Switzerland or Italy or something like that.  50/50 vg-pg\u000a\u000a$8.95 Is the other option without the Juice. Spend the buck
p6
aVOVNS JC01 refillable pods work with the juul and are great! I've filled one 5 times and its still going strong! (Although I think it might give out soon, but 5 fills is impressive!)
p7
aVI work in a shape and sell a ton of stuff. The biggest ones right now that seem to have the most happy users are the Smok Nord, and the Lost Vapes Orion. They're pricey, but well worth it, and to a degree they're ambidextrous devices allowing salt nicotine and regular e-juice. If you're looking for sleeker, the Smok Novo is probably the most popular one I've seen recently. All of the devices listed aren't necessarily as small as a Juul, the Nord and Orion being near the size of the Breeze, but they're definitely the highest quality ones I know of at the moment. 
p8
aVI\u2019m a huge fan of the Zero. Best tasting and feeling one I\u2019ve used. The mouth piece rocks and it has ceramic coils in the pod. I own a juul, breeze 2, nautilus aio, spryte and a novo and I only use the Zero now. I actually have two. 
p9
aVYou can brake juul pods open if I'm not wrong you have to lift the plastic retaining fins on the side and pull it off, then you can throw in new liquid. Don't quote me on this and I do not recommend it as I have no expirience with pods
p10
aVLongest lasting coils/pods?\u000a\u000aVape is illegal in the current country I'm residing. There are no vape shops, can't buy online neither. The only way to get something local is through sketchy people and for 4x the price, with limited options. \u000a\u000a\u000aI received a Juul as a gift from my sister when she visited me from UK. It made me quit the Marlboros. However the replacement pods are impossible to find here and I have burned all pods due to the continuous refilling.\u000a\u000a\u000aMy sister is visiting me soon, and I'm here to ask you guys what's the best option available in the market that have the longest lasting coils/pods. Like is there a coil/pod system that can last at least two weeks? This is for MTL vaping.\u000a\u000a\u000aI don't care much about the flavor, nor the battery life, not even the cost. My biggest concern is that I don't want to run out of replacement coils/pods and revert back to the cigarettes.\u000a\u000a\u000aI don't have the understanding or the experience to deal with RDA/RTA. A pod system or an AIO is perfect for me. I use 50/50 nic salts.\u000a\u000a\u000aI'll appreciate all of your feedback.
p11
aVI have a 2.5 month old Novo pod that still works from when I quit cigs. Not pretty or tasty, but it works &amp; gets you your nicotine. I'd buy a backup device (I'm of the owning 2 assures you have 1 philosophy) as you could get 2 for the price of a Juul stick here in the States. \u000a\u000aThis is all I have personal experience with longevity-wise atm for pod systems. But I hear good things about the Aspire Breeze 2 or Smok Nord (I have the latter &amp; love it, but can't speak for longevity as I've but only had a month &amp; I use more DL mods now) or the Nautilus 2 (adjustable airflow sounds nice).\u000a\u000aGood luck &amp; hope this helps!
p12
aVI just curios if every juul has the words \u201c1richrah\u201d I want to know what this means, I googled it and couldn\u2019t find anything so can someone please explain?\u000a\u000a
p13
aVIt may be a batch number/lot number from the factory. That\u2019s my only guess really, never owned a Juul personally.
p14
aVEven the raccoons know what\u2019s up\u000a\u000aImagine one foaming out the mouth with a juul in its hand

p16
aVLost Orion.. it's more pricy than most pod systems but worth it! Check out all Lost vape products. They are pioneers in the industry. Just picked up an Orion myself a few days ago. Have been using mod systems for years.. went through so so many  until I came accross LOST Vape. best mod I ever bought.\u000a\u000aRecently I decided to look into pod systems. Same story. Though I only went through a couple pod systems ( none of them did the  job for me) until I realized LOST VAPE had one. The ORION. Granted I've only had it for less than a week but it kicks ass compared to JUUL, SMOK NOVA, SUARIN ( saurin is a good system too but dont know if it takes regular ejuice)\u000aBut even if it did..Orion's where it's at.\u000a
p17
aVDepends what type of device you\u2019re going to be using. In a pod system using nic salt try 25 and if it doesn\u2019t work go up to 45/50. If you\u2019re using a sub-ohm tank probably 6 and if it\u2019s too much step down to 3. \u000a\u000aI smoked ~ a pack a day and started w/ a Juul (which is 59mg) stepped down by refilling to 45. When I switched to sub ohm started w/ 6 and switched to 3 after a month or so. \u000a\u000aHope that helps 
p18
aVI work at a vape shop mate, you\u2019re being mis-sold. \u000a\u000aThe workers there either get paid commission or they get rankings/bonuses based on their daily averages. \u000a\u000aYou accepting what they sell just raises their average sale/commission especially when they upsell you this hot garbage. Their job is to upsell you. \u000a\u000aGet a cool fire 4 or a TC150s with a Zenith or Nautilus X tank and use 12mg liquid or 20mg Solts (solts are better). \u000a\u000aDon\u2019t use cloud kits/sub ohm kits to quit smoking, only get one once you\u2019ve already quit with a non-cloud vape and downed your nicotine strength. \u000a\u000aOr you could get a Juul \U0001f602
p19
aVThanks man. Hope it helps someone out. I see people recommending some crazy shit to newbies. That's awesome for some people that want to tinker. But after vaping long enough to see the evolution of vaping, seeing trends come and go, seeing all of the cool new innovations, there's just something to be said for a bulletproof setup that just works. Hell, even as someone that has built a mod out of a damn flashlight, I still think pod systems, even the Juul, are really cool. They're just so simple and minimalist and they just *work*. I see a lot of elitist behavior around the simplification of vaping, but some people just want nicotine, not a hobby. 
p20
aVHey crazyJ2018. Thanks again for the info. I have another question that I can't seem to get answered online.\u000a\u000aWith the juul system I was told not to use a regular phone charging usb box to charge it but rather use a laptops USB port. \u000a\u000aDoes this recommendation the same for the Orion? \u000a\u000aAlso, I am having some difficulty  determining when my Orion needs a charge. last night I put it on the charger for the first time after using it for a few hours and the light went from red to blue in less than a minute. I thought to myself so it must be fully charged.\u000a\u000aAbout 30min ago, I felt like I wasn't getting strong hits so I decided to charge it. This time I plugged it into my laptop and the light has been slowly flashing red. I assume because it has escribe its okay to plug into a computer or laptop? And I assume it would charge it too, correct? If so:\u000a\u000a\u000aIs the light supposed to flash when it's charging?\u000a \u000aWhile not charging but vaping Will the light come on and indicate when I need a charge or do I just have to guess based on how the device is performing? \u000a\u000aHow long should I keep it on the charger for on average, based on your experience with yours?\u000a\u000aI know that there are phases of lights it runs through from dead battery up thru fully charged. But besides that, they do not give you as much instruction in the manual as I thought they would.\u000a\u000a( My paranormal DNA 250c mod came with a book practically)\u000a\u000aThe one I bought was unfortunately the one on display at the store as it was the color I wanted.\u000a\u000aIf you feel what im saying is wrong and that all these questions should be answered in the manual, please let me know as they may have forgotten to give me all that was in the opened box.\u000a\u000aThanks again!
p21
aVHonestly if you can spend the extra money, I have a Smok Novo, provides the same service, no button etc, has a refillable 2ml tank, 450mah battery (over double the JUUL) and the pods last forever. Highly recommend. 
p22
aVThanks! I saw it next to infinix and uboat but didnt pay it much attention. The price is about the same where I\u2019m from (Bosnia), around 35-50 KM which is like 15-27 USD I reckon. Never used JUUL cuz it\u2019s a salt nic with replaceable pods (not e-liquid), which bothers me a little. 
p23
aVWhich vape to get for 0mg nicotine?\u000a\u000aI am thinking of getting a vape, I first saw the Juul and thought it looked very sleek and was leaning towards buying one. I then realized that it\u2019s not officially refillable and there\u2019s only a workaround to refilling the pods. I am looking for something that can hold 0mg nicotine and easily refillable but about the same size as the Juul or Novo. Since this is my first time buying a vape, I just want to know whether nicotine free is harmful in any way?\u000a\u000aThanks
p24
aVInterested in getting a box mod\u000a\u000aSo I\u2019ve only ever used tiny refillable cartridges like the juul and suorin drop but I want to start using a box mod but don\u2019t know the maintenance process of it. Do you have to change anything, for example, the coil or anything? I know for juul and suorin all you do is pop in the cartridges and that\u2019s it. But is a box mod harder to maintain?

aVMTL tank for V2 Trinity\u000a\u000aSo I tried to start vaping months ago and bought the V2 trinity starter kit.   I didn\u2019t do much research and I am not happy with it. So I tried the JUUL system. Just the type of hit I was looking for.   \u000a\u000aI\u2019ve been doing research now and I\u2019m still at a loss. \u000a\u000aI\u2019d like to know if there is a MTL tank that would work with the trinity or should I just ditch it and pick up a new mod?\u000a\u000a

aVPod system with best throat hit 321. Go\u000a\u000ahey everyone. First thanks to all that have been responding to me lately. It seems some of the answers have been lost so I just wanted to revisit this one more time. What would be the best throat punch. My first was a juul and it's okay. I just bought a smok Nova and a little disappointed and the throat hit itself stunt really feel it. \u000a\u000aMy next purchase will be the Lost Orion, however I am looking for suggestions on another pod system that packs a serious throat punch.\u000a\u000aThanks \u000a
p28
aVI was smoking around 15 cigs American Spirits a day (they are pretty up there in nic.) I think with your explanation I\u2019m gonna just try to do a puff or two every hour. I\u2019m doing 50 nic salt. I think I\u2019m gonna have to reprogram myself to not need as many puffs. I had the Juul and could do 6 drags and not have an issue. Then again I wasn\u2019t getting much vapor production/it wasn\u2019t ripping as much nic. Thanks. 
p29
aVLooking for mod or pod\u000a\u000aGreeting vapers, \u000aI need your help. I currently am using a paranormal DNA 250 with a smok tank. Buy issue is that I vape at a very high wattage. 130watts and up. Because I travel a lot I am looking for a compact vape mod or vape pod to switch over too. \u000acan someone please suggest a couple of either mini mods that go up to 140 Watts or above, or a vape pod system that packs a powerful throat hit/punch. \u000a\u000aMy first salt nic purchase was the juul last week and I'm having issues with already ( loose pods)  on top of the fact that it just doesn't hit hard. Feel like I get dizzy from long pulls and not much vape.\u000a\u000aI've heard good things about the Lost Orion... But looks to be more like a mod concept with a coil etc.. and only goes up to 40watt? Correct?\u000a\u000aAnyway. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, as I've been searching for quite some time. \u000a\u000aAlso, if anyone could list good tanks that take high watt coils other than the cloud beast that would be very helpful as well as I'd like to get a smaller tank 4 my paranormal DNA mod but I can't seem to find a tank that has coils that can hit up 150 or above\u000a\u000aThank you vapers!
p30
aVYou're going to have a hard time finding a small device that hits up to 140W.  A compact dual 18650 is probably what you're looking for.  The Smoant Cylon is quite compact.  Check out this [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c4MZ2xYBE-1-0A6rLYY46OHtzHCM-roJINpxghmhzXM/edit#gid=591887101) for some other options and do a bit of research to find their dimensions.  \u000a\u000aRegarding the Juul and the salts.  Nic salts don't have as much throat hit as freebase nicotine and are not designed for large clouds of vapor.  You'd be better off vaping freebase nicotine.  \u000a\u000aTank wise, the Sigelei Slydr Tank has two variants of coils that range between 50 and 285W.  
p31
aVWow this is awesome info thanks alot. I believe you are right about not finding a mini mod with that kind of wattage as I've been searching for a long time.\u000a\u000aWill definitely have to research free base nicotine not so familiar with the concept. My goal is not big clouds so if I can find something that packs a punch and moving away from The big box mods will be fine. I don't mind that the juul doesn't give me a ton of vape though it feels as if I drag for 10 seconds before I get anything. That may be because I'm used to such volume in an instant. But but that being said I just want that throat feel you know
p32
aVAwesome. Thanks for the info. I'll do some more research and come back with my findings. I have many box mods so one more won't hurt. going to keep looking for an alternative to the juul as well. 
p33
aVDepends on your device, nic level, coil... pretty much every factor under the sun.\u000a\u000aLow-level vapers (eg. Juul vapers) will probably vape a pod a day. (0.8ml)\u000a\u000aAverage vapers between 1-2ml/day.\u000a\u000aModerate vapers 3-6ml a day.\u000a\u000aHeavy all-dayers with low nic can do 10-15ml in a day.\u000a\u000aMy personal record was 40ml in a day (and what a day that was)\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aI'd say on average, for someone with a generic set up (lets say... Falcon on the Drag? Why not) but still vapes pretty consistently, average estimate is 60ml/week, counting for coil primes and any minimal spillage.
p34
aVI'm pretty sure there's a Smok branded pod system that is sub-ohm, I've not tried it though so I can't speak about its quality. I don't remember the name but it isn't the novo or the new Nord (which could also fit your usage as it has an .6 mesh coil option).\u000a\u000aThe Mi-Pod is one system I've actually use and it hits harder than my other pod devices (Smok Fit, Rolo Badge and Juul), I don't think it gets to the kind of wattage you're seeking but it does have a lot more airflow and produces more vapor than them.
p35
aVSucks that juuls pod prices just went up too. Right after I purchased it. 
p36
aVJuul help\u000a\u000aRecently, I got some cucumber pods for my juul and was using them for like a day or so. I popped in a refill watermelon pod today and it still faintly tastes of cucumber.

aVQuit juuling to go back to my mod and it's been a great decision\u000a\u000aAt some point I switched to a juul, but after a few months I was very addicted to it. It was getting ridiculous. Spending tons of money on pods and to get my nic was not good for me.\u000a\u000aI finally went back to my mod and it's been much nicer, cheaper, and I'm able to wean myself off well.  \u000a\u000aIf you are juuling and are thinking about switching to a mod, DO IT. 
p40
aVHonestly the "Juul" is really good for people that are trying to quit and arent that interested in getting into vaping as a hobby . They're hits are similar to cigs , you get the Juul it comes with a little magnetic usb port charger, chargers from 0-100 in about 30 mins . You buy pods for them from about any gas station around for 15$ USD for 4 pods. Each pod has the same nicotine as a pack of cigarettes . On the Juul website they actually have a calculator that you can see how much youll save, so if at a pack a day , for newport 100s ( in NY atleast ) youll be saving just under 4k a year. \u000a\u000aJuul Website : [Click](https://www.juul.com/)\u000a\u000aJuul Calc : [Click](https://www.juul.com/calculator)\u000a\u000aThe Juul is the most user friendly vape you could buy for anyone trying to quit . 
p41
aVWithout a doubt , Juul it known to help people that have smoked for 10+ years fully quit cigs . They have alot of success stories . 
p42
aVI second this. Definitely check out Juul. 
p43
aVBasically you're looking for a non-refillable pod system. Meaning you can buy a prefilled pod and just stick it into the device like the Juul. In terms of which brand is better than the other I cant really help you as I'm not very experienced when it comes to pod systems, however 2 good places to look would be \u000a\u000ahttps://vapewild.eu\u000a\u000a and \u000a\u000ahttps://www.electrictobacconist.co.uk

aVJuices/flavors that don't really smell\u000a\u000aBasically I've juuled a while, and I've tried vaping before, but once I got complaints about the smell from my roommates(I had hype blue slushee 3mg + stick prince tfv12), I decided to eventually move back to juul. I tried quitting juul cold turkey(horrible mistake), so I've decided to give my vape another shot.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAnyone know of liquids and/or flavors that aren't very strong in smell? Currently considering peppermint but I'm open to other suggestions

aVbest guess is like a 650mah 3.7V battery. you could get like a kanger evod or t3d, maybe an aspire k1 tank. It wouldn't be a good setup. most people these days use those batteries for THC pre-filled cartridges.   \u000a\u000a\u000aIf you want something small and easy to carry and use I recommend pod systems. You've probably heard of the Juul, they suck, get a refillable pod system like the Mi Pod or a Suorin or the Renova Zero, Lostvape Orion Lots of great options. nic level depends on how much you smoke.  salt nic just is great, you won't have to vape all day and it feels just like smoking.  I like a 30mg salt nic, the Juul is 55mg there are all sorts of juices out there. I like Fuzzy Man by Zen Nic Salts its a Mango, Peach, Kiwi shit is bomb af

aVUp to date beginner kit to buy for a family member who smokes? What should I get?\u000a\u000aI hear juuls are popular. What should I buy and where to buy it?
p49
aVJuul is far too expensive. I personally had a good experience with the Smok Stik Prince but I've heard a lot of things about them as a company that are quite negative. But what I can say is the coils lasted me quite a while although I don't know what wattage I was running as I was still a newbie vapor. Oh and it was super easy to use.\u000a\u000aGood luck!
p50
aVJuuls are expensive.  But are still a very good starting point.  They are extremely simple to use and for someone wanting to switch from analogs to vaping simplicity is key at the beginning. \u000a\u000aMost if not all Vape shops will have a Juul kit
p51
aVas the people are saying juuls arent that expensive compared to cigarettes , if you smoke about 10 cigs/per day youll be saying over 1200$ with juul. Juul's are incredibly easy to use and you can find them atleast in upper new york. In almost any gas station around here , if not just go and find your local vape shop they will have them ! 
p52
aVWhat kind of prices should I be expecting to pay? Was looking for something in the 50$ range to compare to the Juuls starter kit. 
p53
aVThe Juuls price is pretty cheap, around $50. It's the pods that'll cost you. There's very little juice inside them, so you'll probably be using half a dozen or more a week, which can be $20-$30 or more, depending on where you get them. The Breeze is around the same price as the Juul at $50, coils $4 which will last around 2 weeks, and a 30ml bottle is anywhere between $12-$20 and will last roughly 3 weeks. Long term, and minus initial device cost you'll be looking at upwards of $80 for Juul pods, and $48 for coils and juice for the Breeze. Those are Canadian prices tho, so you may get them cheaper elsewhere but the ratios will still be the same.

aVSourin air or sourin drop. They only last about 3 months before dying but there 20$ and the amount of money saved by changing from the Juul makes up for it 10x

aVMoving up from Juul\u000a\u000aI was a 46 year Newport smoker that tried a Juul and quit without even really trying. However, I'm read for a sub ohm I think. I've been researching all day and have come up with these 4 possible starter kits....would you experienced guy tell me which one you'd pick out of these? I really appreciate your help.\u000a\u000aInnokin Endura T20S Vape Starter Kit\u000a\u000aEleaf iJust 2 Starter Kit\u000a\u000aKanger SubVod Starter Kit\u000a\u000aJoyetech eGO AIO D22 XL Vape Starter Kit\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;

aV&gt;2 comments\u000a\u000aNewports are a very strong cig, but they don't burn your throat. I like how the Juul crackles a bit, but I don't like having to buy pods and refilling Juul pods are a pain. I want a nice big hit that tastes good. I've been refilling the juul pods with this menthol blackberry e juice that tastes pretty good, but it's killing the juuls. So yeah if you can gleen anything from that please let me know....this vaping stuff is complex....!
p59
aVAlright, so I'm narrowing this down... But first, kudos for learning how to refill Juul pods but to be honest there are refillable ones you can buy that will give you a much better experience than refilling Juul pods. \u000a\u000aBy "strong hit" I'm assuming you mean how hard the nicotine hits? If so, what strength of juice are you using? It'll be marked on the bottle like "50mg" or "5%". If you can find me the PG/VG ratio that would help me a bit too, but if you can't that's not a worry. I just want to dial in your wants *and* needs.\u000a\u000a"Big hit" meaning bigger clouds than the Juul? 
p60
aVOK I just looked up the one you suggested earlier and if I'm not mistaken it is a "mouth to lung" starter kit as opposed to a sub ohm? When you say there are refillable ones, do you mean refillable Juul pods? I did think just getting a diabetic syringe might make it a bit easier, but I don't have one right now. The juice I've been using is 50/50. Big clouds are kinda cool, but I just want to feel the hit as strong, but I don't want it to be dry or burn my throat, and I want to try all kinds of flavors that are spicy and cool....and nicotine is important too, I've only had the juul and the NY purchased ejuice which I think is the same as juul when it comes to nicotine; I could probably go a bit stronger on the nicotine. . When I bought that first bottle of e juice and saw how little I used I thought moving from the very regular buying of pods could be replaced with the semi regular buying of juice and I'd save even more money. I'm good with using software, but I'm also like my privacy and don't like the idea of some company knowing every time I take a hit....Thanks so much for your help. Let me know what you got...
p61
aVAlright, so there are a few options. The first one is the Lost Vape Orion; it's still a pod system but it has a lot more customization and flexibility than any other pod due to the advanced software and hardware it has. You get 5 custom wattage levels (think of it as how hot the vapour is and how big the clouds are; the higher the wattage, generally speaking the higher both of those qualities get) and once you get the wattage set right you press and hold the wattage button to change it into a mode ("Replay") that will give you the same hit every time you hit the fire button. This includes giving you dry hit protection, very nice to have. You don't really need to fiddle with the PC software unless you get into the customization aspect of it or it comes improperly configured out of the box (mine did); in either case feel free to shoot me a DM or chat on here and I'm always happy to help if I'm online. You don't really have to worry about any company knowing your vaping habits as the online service is separate from the Escribe program, but I will note that the mod does internally record how you vape. Again, there's no need to plug it into your computer once you have your settings dialed in though.\u000a\u000aThe second option would be something like a Uwell Nunchaku mod ("mod" refers to the battery part of the ecig as opposed to the tank part, similar to the pod part of the Juul) paired with an Innokin Zenith tank. The styling on the Nunchaku is sort of aggressive but the full black Nunchaku and Zenith look really nice together. The Zenith doesn't throw gigantic clouds but it's currently top of the pack when it comes to flavour tanks. It can do either a MTL (mouth to lung) or RDTL (restricted direct to lung) pull depending on which coil you use. The Nunchaku mod is simple to use; once you have the right wattage set for your taste you don't have to worry about fiddling with any settings, you can leave it where it's set and it'll be great every time. You'll need a battery called an 18650 with that; for that, only get it from [Illumn](http://www.illumn.com/), [Liionwholesale](http://www.liionwholesale.com/) or [IMR Batteries](http://www.imrbatteries.com/). Those are the three most trusted websites out there and knockoff (rewrapped) 18650s can be dangerous. For the battery, get the Samsung 30Q; if that's not available get the Sony VTC6 or LG HG2.\u000a\u000aFor another mod suggestion there's the Innokin Kroma-A, which is what the Zenith is paired with as a kit. That's convenient

aVOVNS makes refillable JUUL pods that are 1ml instead of 0.7ml
p63
aVI went from a old pod device to a smok vape pen 22 to another mod that really sucked. They were ok, but buying coils gets old quick. The Better the flavor of the juice you get, the quicker those coils seem to get nasty (sucralose and artificial sweeteners gunk up the wicks). \u000a\u000aOf all the ones I had, the vape pen type setups were the best, but buying coils might get expensive. \u000a\u000aAlso, I quit on 4mg juice, not realizing it was that low. You've been using juul which is 50mg per. With these sub tanks you will get a lot more vapor so the juice you've been filling your juul with will be potentially dangerous with sub ohm Vaping. You may need to look up a similar flavor with 3 or 6 mg per milliliter. \u000a\u000aEventually I found RDAs (rebuildable dripping atomizers) and other similar devices and I wish I had had the confidence to start with those because everything else seemed like a waste of money in comparison. \u000a\u000aIf you can operate a screwdriver you can rebuild an atomizer.  Using external batteries opens up a lot of options and it is much better (and yes you\u2019ll need a charger but they aren\u2019t expensive really). \u000a\u000aCongratulations on quitting. I have several people in my life who also tried vaping and failed. They just didn\u2019t try hard enough. 
p64
aVYou bring up alot a great points in areas that are fuzzy for me right now. See, I thought I just want to get a vap where I can open it up and dump some juice in. I thought the Juul Pods costs could be cut down further buying bulk ejuice....so I started researching the vape pens too. It took me several hours before I realized you have to buy the coils semi regularly. The cost seemed a little lower to me that juul pods (cost me $15 for 4 in NYS) I was going through 1 pack a week, so $60 per month. According to my research coil replacement happens about every 2 weeks give or take. I was seeing coils for the vape pens at about $10 for five. So, the 5 should last you 1-2 months and the cost should be around $10 on top of the juice, which might be $30.00 per month (that's a guess). So yeah, I hope I'm not banging my head against the wall thinking I'm gonna save some money when in the end it costs the same. But I do want the improved hit and some of the flavors as well. I like menthol, and would probably try some of the more hot or spicy flavors as opposed to sweet. I had two juul atomizers and the juice I bought did ruin one of them. I'm not sure if it was actually the juice or the fact that I reused a juul pod and refilled it with the juice....the juice appeared to completely drain out of the pod directly into the juul...it got so hot I couldn't hold it and hasn't worked since. The other one is still hanging in there.  I appreciate what you are saying about the rebuild-ables. While I was researching the types of vapes, I was like, that must be for professional vapers or something....they sound intimidating....and it sounds like you're buying so many different things that it could become very expensive? Thanks again for your help ...very insightful
p65
aVHonestly, depending on a variety of things you're very likely to save money switching from the Juul regardless of how much you vape. I actually wrote a breakdown of the difference in costs[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vaping101/comments/9zepho/ever_wondered_how_much_the_juul_or_other/) and did up a few very simple algebraic formulas. You know your Juul cost, so I'm gonna do a really rough calculation to see how much money you could potentially save:\u000a\u000a$2/coil\u000a$12.50/30ml of salt nic ejuice (educated guess, I'm not sure what prices are in the US)\u000a\u000aTaking your Juul consumption into account (you're vaping roughly 12ml of ejuice through the Juul per month) and adding 10% to make up for the different style of vaping and if you use 2 coils in a month you'll be spending:\u000a\u000a(12 * 1.1 * 12.50 / 30) + (2 * 2) = $9.50 a month. That's:\u000a\u000a(12ml plus 10% multiplied by the price of a bottle divided by bottle size) plus (the cost of 2 coils a month) = what you'll be spending in a best-case scenario. For a worst-case, maybe a stressful month or something:\u000a\u000a(12 * 1.3 * 14 / 30) + (3.5 * 2) = $14.50\u000a\u000aThis is assuming 30% more usage than the Juul and 3 1/2 coils.

p71
aVall the cool kids use juul tho /s

aVThis is why they are banning Juul flavors. 
p73
aVI\u2019d say the Sourin Air. It\u2019s been working great for me. But then again I have only had the chance to use 2 pod systems (the air and the Juul). The pods for air are cheap too and they last upto 7-10 refills from what I have heard.
p74
aVUpdate:\u000a   Used a Juul for a week loved it but wanted to upgrade it for cost effectiveness and flavor profiles. \u000a     Upgraded to a Nautilus AIO since they didn\u2019t have the Drop at my local shop. \u000a     Used 50 nic for 1 day felt fine, got really sick day 2 at a child\u2019s first birthday party. Went back to stinkies. Tried watering it down with 0 nic and was still too scared to use it. \u000a     Just bought 6 nic juice at a different shop got to explain to a guy my history with Vaping and what I smoke analogue wise. Was getting good hits while driving home and was able to rip it again after I left another store. So far so good. \u000a     He explained that the 50 nic salt is too high for the power of the Nautilus for me. It\u2019s not a lower power level pod system. 
p75
aVNice! I need to try that mango one! I\u2019m 8 months of smokes! Was way easier than I expected. I used a Juul for about 2 months and switched through a few pod kits until I got my renova zero. Love the ceramic coils.

aVMy juul has disappeared in my car\u000a\u000aI had my juul in my car never got out of my car and I lost it somewhere I\u2019ve looked everywhere and it\u2019s still fine I\u2019ve lost 3 now in my car and idk where it could be 
p77
aVAll of the devices here are sub par pod systems with the exception of the Juul.. I only say that because it works but is extremely expensive for most users.. The way they describe Smok products is complete and utter BS.. Same goes for Sourin. I'm not saying I have all the knowledge of pod systems but I have enough to know there are FAR better systems that should've made this list.  These wouldn't have even made my top 20.        It almost seems like they paid to have these on here given how ludacris this list is... I would recommend the Innokin EQ, The MI-pod or The Smoant S8.. Those are my top three and either one of them will serve you well, My Friend.
p78
aVEver wondered how much the Juul (or other closed/non-refillable) is costing you vs a refillable pod system? Come on in, I ran the numbers! (And they don't look good...)\u000a\u000aA 4pk of 0.7ml Juul pods (they're all the same capacity) is $21CAD at my B&amp;M before taxes. (All of the prices in this post are in CAD but are specifically designed to scale easily to USD.) That's $5.25 per pod. If I went through one to one and a half pods a day I'd be saving a little money as a pack of death sticks is $11-13 here, but when I tried a Juul-compatible pod system (OVNS JC01 and DO NOT BUY IT, it's dirt cheap for a reason) I could've easily ripped through 2.5-3.5 pods a day at my current nicotine consumption level. Admittedly, I vape a lot, but at that price if your mother vapes more than a pod and a half daily and depending on price (US cig prices, anyway) she's more than likely gonna lose out financially.\u000a\u000aLet's go calculate the price of Juul pods per week, month and year based on what I'd assume a smoker would use (1 pod a day). Let's not even think about how much I'd spend, alright? YIKES!\u000a```\u000a$5.25 * 7 = $36.75/wk ($27.79USD)\u000a\u000a$36.75 * 4 = $147/mo ($111.17USD)\u000a\u000a$147 * 12 = $1764 ($1333USD)/yr! YIIIIIKES!\u000a\u000aFor the math to figure out multiple or fractions of pods:\u000a\u000ap * u = amount spent per day\u000a\u000aVariables:\u000ap = price of pod\u000au = number of pods used per day\u000a```\u000a\u000aOpen pod systems are incredibly cheap by comparison but the math to figure it out is more arbitrary. Your mom will likely only go through 2-3ml of juice a day if high-concentration salt nics are used (35-50mg would be ideal). The average open pod's capacity is 1.5-2ml, so that's one to two fills a day. The general rule with pod systems is they get 5-8 refills before the pod mouthpiece has to be discarded due to nasty flavour or lack of clouds (normally the former will happen long before the latter). The average pod is $2-5CAD and a 30ml of 50mg salt nics is $18. Assuming average consumption, capacity, refills and pod price:\u000a\u000a18 (dollars) / 30(ml bottle) * 2 (ml per fill)  === $1.20 per fill. Already we're seeing massive savings; 2ml of Juul pods (price includes pod cost) would cost you $15!\u000a\u000aBut then we have to factor in the price of pods:\u000a\u000a3.50 (average pod price in CAD) / 6 (fills per pod) === $0.58 per fill. Add the salt nics and the pod price together and you get $1.78 per fill. That's a very rough average of the daily cost if using very high nic concentrations. In Canada, $1.78 would buy you 4 cigarettes; $1.78CAD === exactly $1.35USD and in the US from what I gather that's anywhere from 4-8 cigs. If your mom smokes less than that talk up the health benefits! :)\u000a\u000aSo let's turn that into a weekly amount:\u000a\u000a1.78 * 7 === $12.46 per week ($9.42USD)\u000a\u000aMonthly (assuming a 30-day month):\u000a\u000a$53.40 ($40.38USD)\u000a\u000aYearly:\u000a\u000a$649.70 ($491.24USD)\u000a\u000a*****\u000a\u000aHere's a formula for you to use:\u000a\u000a```\u000a(c / b * f) + (P / F) === your cost to fill the pod *per day!*\u000a\u000aVariables:\u000a\u000ac = price of a bottle of ejuice\u000ab = bottle size in ml\u000af = capacity of the pod in ml\u000aP = price of a pod\u000aF = number of fills per pod
p79
aVHad a Juul, price was coming out to that of 3 packs of cigarettes for 4 pods. I was saving 1 pack of cigarettes. Went to a Breeze 2 system for 2 people, comes out to \u005c~$20 for a 30ml bottle every week to a week and a half. So instead of $17 every \u005c~2 days, it goes to around $60 a month effectively saving over $100 a month. I feel Juul would be a better system if the pods weren't nearly as much as a pack of cigarettes themselves.
p80
aVGreat write-up! I\u2019ve never bought a Juul for this very reason. I always try to tell my friends how much cheaper it is, but maybe they\u2019re just too lazy to fill it up or try something new. I\u2019m currently using the sourin air and it\u2019s just as satisfying as the Juul imo
p81
aVThey don\u2019t need to lower their prices because they sell a shitload of them. What juul sells is convenience. 150 bucks over the course of a year isn\u2019t really much to a person that doesn\u2019t want to bother with buying juice and filling their own pods. 
p82
aVFor most people that use reddit they already know this and aren\u2019t gonna use a juul. \u000a\u000aConvenience is pretty important tho. I mean you can get that cost down to about hmmm 80 for the year using salts on a rebuidable instead of a pod. 
p83
aVThat\u2019s why I switched to juul. \u000a
p84
aVSince your mom isn't buying it for herself then I would go with something that is super super easy to use AND (this is the important part) she can refill as easily as she would buy a new pack of cigarettes. I think that means you should stick to a pod system, and one carried in gas stations, drug stores, and supermarkets. Hopefully she likes it so much, and is so impressed by how easy it is, and how much better she feels coming off combustion products, that she leaves the cigarettes behind. If she wants to branch out with more customizable (or cheaper refill) options, that can be something she does after she gets used to vaping instead of smoking. \u000a\u000aLook for a Juul, Blu, MarkTen, etc...

aVA big review of a little device: the OVNS JC01\u000a\u000aI saw this impossibly small mod at my local shop and I couldn't resist. When I found out it took Juul pods it was a done deal as I didn't want to pay the money for a Juul battery but wanted to try the Juul ejuice experience. Well, I mean I got an experience alright but, hahah, yeahhhhh. Let's get right down to it.\u000a\u000a*****\u000a\u000aCrucial tech specs:\u000a\u000aWattage: ~5-9 (Juul pods), ~6-11 (refillable OVNS pods), ~4-8 (refillable CBD-only pods)\u000a\u000aPod resistance: 1.8ohm (Juul pods), 1.5ohm (refillables), 2.0 (CBD pods)\u000a\u000aBattery capacity: 400mAh\u000a\u000aDraw-activated\u000a\u000a*****\u000a\u000aFor starters, this thing visually impresses no matter what colour you get it in. The Aurora is particularly beautiful, but I went with the red. The finish on the non-metallic ones is nice; slightly rubbery so it won't slip from your grasp even with gloves on (important in Canada!) but without looking overly like a Fisher Price toy. \u000a\u000aThe size is impressively small considering there's a 400mAh battery on board, which is fully double that of the Juul. I'm not really sure what's going on with that 400mAh battery; I know Juul pods only run at between ~5-9w but I've never had any pod system's battery last more than 5-6 hours. I only charged this guy once a day when I was using it.\u000a\u000aThe flavour out of the refillable pods was damn good considering the size of the device; on par with or perhaps better than the Justfog Minifit. I was surprised at how flavourful the Juul pods were. I tried the Cool Cucumber and Virginia Tobacco and was surprised when I loved them both, particularly the tobacco. \u000a\u000aHowever, now we have to talk about how this little guy performs. And hoo boy. Oh *man.* This thing is quite literally *painful* to use. I have no idea if this was just my unit or if I don't know how to Juul but I'd get a single good hit off of a Juul pod and then nothing but dry hits. The stock refillable pod burned within 5-10 hits. I managed to fix the pods by tapping them with my fingernail, but that's not really feasible to do after every single hit. I'm thinking there's an imperfect seal around the pods that prevents proper suction from happening to both the Juul and the stock refillable pods, which may be just my unit but it's extremely frustrating and makes this thing almost unusable for me. The only way I use it now is if I need a single stealth hit every so often when I'm out and about; aside from that it just stays in a coat pocket until I realize I forgot to bring a mod with me. \u000a\u000aAll in all, this device not only doesn't get a recommendation from me but a firm "no". There's something wrong with either the draw activation or the seal around the pods, but the end result is ceaseless dry hits unless you tap it against something after every hit. Not really something anyone wants to do when there are so many better alternatives out there. I'd rather deal with charging a Juul every 5-8 hours, but once I'm out of Juul pods I'm probably going to recycle this device as it's honestly not worth keeping and I don't feel like selling it is very moral considering I know how much it sucks. I'm not even going to go through "I deducted points for..." because considering the screwy dry hit crap, this thing should get a 0. However in the interests of fairness I'm giving this thing a 3/10 because that first hit before the dry hits start is great. But everything after is like inhaling superheated volcanic dust.\u000a\u000a#3/10

aVMetal detectors and vape pens\u000a\u000aSo I live in Miami and because of all the school shootings and shit, my high-school decided to add a metal detector at the door and it wasn\u2019t a problem till everyone said fuck it and started vaping the most common vape is the Juul and we ended up accidentally walking through with it Bc we her high and forgot it was in our pockets now every one juuls in school but lately it\u2019s gotten crazy people are trying to sneak in crazy vape pens and some don\u2019t beep like a 300$ one that you can only get it in by wearing cargo shorts but that\u2019s besides the point. My question is if I go through the metal detector with my Sourin Drop will it cause it to beep or am I good ?

aVVape pen and nicotine liquid sourcing recommendation for Bluebird CBD oil + low-nicotine solution\u000a\u000aHi Reddit -- please be kind to me!\u000a\u000aI was a daily weed smoker for about 15 years. I recently decided to kick the habit, and have been supplementing with capsules of Green Mountain CBD a couple times a day. Going by how I feel when I have the capsules vs the days I don't, I definitely think it's making an impact on easing me out of what was for me an addiction.\u000a\u000aI'm also Juuling, which needs to stop. I'd like to switch over to a vape pen that can support a decent-quality, vetted low-nicotine oil supplemented by CBD oil. I've looked around and it seems like the most vetted and affordable CBD oil I can find is from Bluebird at around $56 (with discount code) for a 1000mg 30ml bottle (though I've also considered Hemp-Direct's.\u000a\u000aTLDR/get to the point: can you recommend affordable vape pens that can reliably take Bluebird's oil? Bonus points if you can recommend a decently-sourced low-nicotine vape liquid. I'm aware that the science is developing in all these areas, and know that almost anything will be better for me than the Juul I've been using, but I'm concerned about vape pen safety, so anything that's probably less likely to leech toxic metals et cetera or at least sold by a somewhat credentialed company would be ideal. Simplicity is key, I'm not personally looking to become an expert on vaping.\u000a\u000aThank you!
