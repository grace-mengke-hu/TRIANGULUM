VI go home on weekends from college so i use those days as a t break, honestly the addiction us MUCH less than nicotibe. I dont smoke anymore but i use a juul, and the withdrawls are so much more
p1
aVis that for a juul?
p2
aVOnes a pax era, ones a juul.
p3
aVlol I had to do this with my juul for like 2 weeks while waiting for a new charger to come in
p4
aVTurning concentrates into e-juice?\u000a\u000aHi, I'm looking for any information you guys can give me to help me about what and how i should go about diluting solid concentrates, such as wax, so that it can be put into a Juul, or similar liquid e-juice cartridges/pens. I read on another thread to use Propylene glycol to dilute, but I was curious to hear about you guys have to say/ how to do it properly. Thanks!
p5
aVlol i use a juul so that helps but i don't like the idea of getting hooked on another substance so i don't use it too much
p6
aVYeah it's a pax era and you can only vape the pre-made cartridges. It's the same thing as the Juul except you get the cool features like Bluetooth connection to your phone and change colors :) In Colorado the pods are made by The Lab and there are 5 available strain specific live resin pods (I tried all of them and the flavor you get from the live resin is amazing). 
p7
aVI always juul while smoking, but then again I always juul.
p8
aVYeah my town has a parents against underage drinking thing so idk why they're going after weed but they sent a thing in the mail that warned parents about electronic cigarettes and vapes and how kids put wax in it and the THC is high and can cause permanent brain damage like it's true and all but worry about other shit like kids being addicted to JUUL and thinking it's fine cause it's vape and not smoke. Like it's a pack a pod and they're worried about weed. Maybe parents against underage drinking should worry about drinking and not weed. I'm ranting sorry
p9
aVPax 3. Pax Era. The links they shared. Juul or iCare mini for nicotine. 
p10
aVbro there's this nicotine vape called a juul and it's the best god damn vape ever. hits like a cig, super light and discrete, and comes with little pods with 50mg nic! honestly made me never want to smoke cigs again 
p11
aVHAHAHAHA man juuls pods are practically currency at my school
p12
aVAyy nothing better than the juul while high 
p13
aVJust got caught by parEnts(drgtest)Little do they know that them stopping my weed habit will only "force" me to become dependent on nicotine (spending 80 dollars on a juul tomorrow, which is like a vape with an extremely high level of nicotine) to fill the craving of something to take the edge off.
p14
aVJuul is only 39.99... \u000athat's in store 
p15
aVJuuls go hard, but you're gonna pay way too much money and then transition over to cigarettes for a quicker, cheaper buzz. Stay away from the Juul, no matter how hard that shit rips ;)
p16
aVGet a Juul!!!!!
p17
aVJUUL vale pod?\u000a\u000aHas anyone tried to refill a JUUL pod with thc oil? I was told a buddy of mine is able to refill his pods by taking the top off so I was wondering if it would work for thc oil instead of vape juice?
p18
aVBeing a Juul user and seeing the mistakes PAX has made lately consumer side has discouraged me from wanting to support them at the moment... BUT the PAX Era is something I'm going to be keeping an eye on.\u000a\u000aNonetheless enjoy your new toy!! Congrats! Not meaning to be a naysayer haha, just my experience :)
p19
aVI have no affiliation with them, so I'm not trying to advertise (rule 9 lol), but I've heard good things about the Juul vaporizer for beginners looking to switch to vaping from tobacco.\u000a\u000aGood luck man!
p20
aVI trust my local brick and Mortor because they sell all pax products, including replacement parts,etc. I also use a juul and have had nothing but positive experiences  with the pax team. I'm leaning towards the 3. HAve you tried anything else?
p21
aVYeah its annoying i bought a juul recently they hit hard and never leak but the pods are expensive.
p22
aVYou can smoke weed with a juul?? Howwwww???
p23
aVThc pods in the works give it a few years though. Once weed becomes legal im sure they will be out there for now i have a guy who can refill old juul pods with wax and that kinda works alright.
p24
aVFlying with an oil pen\u000a\u000aI am flying from California to Chicago next month and am thinking of bringing my stiiizy pen(looks just like a juul). Anyone have any experience flying with a concentrate pen? 
p25
aVThis picture has me nervous that cat is going to just swat your bud all over the place LOL. Is that a normal juul or is it modified for wax etc?\u000a
p26
aVI spotted the juul and instantly got moist 
p27
aVWhat\u2019s a juul?
p28
aVOh ok I\u2019ve never seen those but I got a stiiizy vape it looks like a juul and really hits
p29
aVJuul Wax Cartridges\u000a\u000a
p30
aVI've tried, only thing at holiday is juul pods 
p31
aVSounds like you're best taking a look at nic salts. I know a lot of heavy smokers who are happy with the buzz and throat hit of 59mg, which is what you're gonna find in most pod systems like Juul 
p32
aVMy 14yo started using a Juul, and once her pod hookup got busted, she switched to cigarettes. I really don\u2019t want to give Ploom any money on principle. But I have a Pax 3 and buy Era Pods so I suppose I\u2019m already feeding the same beast...\u000a\u000aI\u2019m not really looking to up my own dose much, if at all. Like I said I\u2019m down to about 2 cigs a day(unless things get really stressful.) But I would like to up it enough to kick the 2 cigs. I feel like I\u2019m almost there.
p33
aVParents casually tell me that life insurance test is tomorrow... Not sure what to do\u000a\u000aTLDR at bottom \u000aSo to start off I don\u2019t smoke much really about once or twice a month. Anyways so yesterday my housemate made brownies and a blunt and asked if I wanted some. so I decided that I haven\u2019t smoked in a while and could relax for the rest of the day so I say sure. Wake up today all good and drive a couple hours to see my family for the weekend. All is good till my fam casually mentions to not eat or go to the bathroom tomorrow morning for life insurance test. Never heard about this and my fam prob thinks I don\u2019t smoke anything so question is should I worry about these life insurance test? Not sure what to do I know I\u2019m fucked for nicotine and marijuana since i have a Juul and smoked yesterday but is it going to fuck my life insurance up?  I\u2019m probably going to wake up multiple times tonight and down water bottles to do something but other than that not much I can do.\u000a\u000aTLDR: Smoked yesterday, fam tells me life insurance tomorrow, will this do damage to life insurance and should I worry 
p34
aVUpvoted because I used a juul because I have to stay clean for a drug test:/
p35
aVDepends on how you pull on the vapes, the potency, and how many pulls you do. I have THC juice in my juul and 3\u005c-4 pulls on that gets me at a solid \u005c[8\u005c]. \u000a\u000aIf you only do small bowls and one\u005c-hitters, 1 good pull on a vape will get you up.
p36
aVI took dab pens and dabs with me for spring break to Arizona. Checked bag in plastic bag with toothbrush and other juul vape shit 
p37
aVThis is how I hit my juul super hard haha
p38
aVI love nicotine sober or high. I\u2019ve kicked cigarettes with the help of my juul, but I still smoke socially and yeah the little rush is great. Sometimes when my friend and I are running low on weed we throw a little bit of rolling tobacco in our bowls to stretch them out
p39
aVQuestion on cbd oil\u000a\u000aTHC oil is illegal in my state, but i recently found out about CBD oil. Has anyone ever tried putting CBD oil in a vape or cart. Hows was it(the high)? Im thinking about buy some for my juul
p40
aVI MADE A JUUL!!!\u000a\u000a
p41
aVI couldn't post this in r/juul or r/drugs but I figured some of you might appreciate this. 
p42
aVThat\u2019s a juul pod boss
p43
aVOil juul?\u000a\u000aWould taking diluted oil or wax and putting it in a juul work??
p44
aVI\u2019d say lungs wise honestly doesn\u2019t feel much different but the high is way cleaner personally, none of the real groggy/lazy feelings even when it\u2019s a heavy indica, you just have a clear head but still high as tits if that makes sense\u000aBut no vaping of any form isn\u2019t a safe alternative to smoking. Some studies have shown that it\u2019s actually worse (but the types of capes are unclear, I\u2019m assuming it refers to standard vapes not carts or things like the juul)
p45
aVPax Era Equivalent in My State?\u000a\u000aIn my state, medical marijuana is legal, but only that, so obviously the Pax Era is not sold here. I was wondering if there was a good equivalent to it that is available everywhere, or at least in my state? I can disclose my state if necessary. \u000aI really like the idea of the Pax Era though. I know Pax makes the Juul and was wondering if it would be ok to just get a Juul and fill the pods on my own or something?\u000aThanks in advance!
p46
aVCan I pour dab juice into a juul?\u000a\u000aThis might sound silly, but I just wanna make sure before I do it. If I take dab juice out of a cartridge and put it into a juul pod will it work properly? \u000a\u000aI got arrested about a year ago and now i'm really sketch about things, so i'm trying to be as inconspicuous as possible. 
p47
aVIf it leaks ur juul is fucked, and they are prone to leaking
p48
aVThe problem is that it will be more susceptible to leaking because u opened up the pod . And also the oil will be impossible to get out of the juul
p49
aVI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good plan, even if you can fill it without the oil leaking. If a cop finds your carts they will not just take your word for it that they\u2019re nicotine because you say \u201cno but look it\u2019s a juul\u201d as evidence that it\u2019s not THC. They\u2019ll confiscate and test it. The police actually have to verify that drugs are drugs, you can\u2019t be charged based on assumptions. That being said, using a juul won\u2019t make it less suspicious in the eyes of a law enforcement officer who is already at the point of searching you. 
p50
aVIs that a juul? A vape 
p51
aVme but smoking a juul lmao 
p52
aVTolerance extremely low?\u000a\u000aI havent smoked in 4-5 months (~18 weeks)\u000aJanuary (12 weeks ago) I started blazing up again.\u000aI smoked at least 3 times a week with my friends in the first 2 months (stopped because of grades). Now I only do Fridays and during school ill hit a dab pen once or twice during lunch and get absolutely baked.\u000aI started smoking at home to 1-3 times a day the last 2 weeks. I would smoke through a gram a week like that since my tolerance is so low.\u000aNow when I was with my friends I would get so baked i wouldnt be able to move. And everyone else is fine. Just high. And im baked out of my mind.\u000a\u000a**TL:DR**\u000aIt seems like my tolerance would rise after smoking massive amounts to the point were I cant move and (once fell asleep while hitting my juul; dont judge, im quitting from cigs) while everyone else is completely fine.
p53
aVDab Oil in Pod Device - help\u000a\u000aAlright so i bought a juul pod refilled with DIY dab oil.\u000aIve been rippin it on 2 different juuls. So much that one of them went from green to red (battery level).\u000aI was told that i need 10-15 hits to feel anything. I dont. It rips but im not experiencing anything. Its been 3 and a half hours since i got it and have been ripping it the whole time.\u000abtw the dab juice in the pod turned darker (from dark honey to black as a pencil tip).\u000aAm I doing anything wrong?\u000aI know that my friend didnt give me fake shit because i know him well and he filled it up in front of me. I also have an eleaf iCare if anything. (Its just hasnt been used in a year and it had juice in it and it now smells like puke).\u000a\u000a**TL;DR**\u000a\u000a**Does DIY dab oil work in juul pods? Am I doing something wrong? Will dab oil like this work in an eLeaf iCare?**\u000a\u000a\u000aedit: I bought it for $5
p54
aVThe Juul pods are kind of made to burn out so that people have to shell out $20 for 4 more instead of refilling them with Mr.Salt-e. Those coils build up carbon quickly and it seeps back into whatever juice you refilled with.\u000a\u000aThe reason you don't feel anything is because the Juul pods are designed to do smaller hits of high nicotine juice.  My guess is that your juice isn't strong enough for it, but there could be a lot of reasons. The Pax Era is better for vaping THC juice.\u000a\u000aHaving said all that, I recently found out that Pax is backed by big tobacco. The Juul pods are really high in nicotine so people get hooked. 
p55
aVFrom my experience, You can refill a juul pod 2-3 times after it becomes shitty *and* dangerous: ive broken 2 juuls because refilled x4-x5 pods leaked in the matter of minutes.\u000aBut the dab juice-oil does look very gooey, like glue.\u000aSo I dont know if that could affect it but it probably does.
p56
aVI have vaped flavorless e-juice with no nicotine in a juul. Btw it is horrible. The taste is complete unflavored puke in a juul and it feels like its more of water vapor. You can blow big clouds tho its unpleasent.\u000aBut in a Baby Beast Tank (sub-ohm atomizer) its completely fine.\u000a\u000aThis oil doesnt taste like that.
p57
aVTry a juul
p58
aVQuit a pack and a half a day habit but now i just vape like 120ml of 3mg every 2 weeks i havent tried the new stuff like a juul but my box and clieto 120 keep me off cigs, though i dont know if its any better for me lol
p59
aVGet a juul 
p60
aVJust wanted to share what happened to me...\u000a\u000aSo I was coming home from a friend\u2019s house and decided to stop on the way home to grind up some bud. I\u2019ll preface this story by saying I am an 18 year old high school senior in the Chicagoland area that is going to college next year. I was driving my father\u2019s car, so I need to find a spot outside to grind, and I parked near the end of a street and walked to a nearby pond covered by some trees.\u000a\u000aWithin five minutes I see a cop pull up, just as I had pulled out my weed and began grinding. My heart rate quadrupled and I attempted to shove everything in my bag as I tried to hide in the woods, hoping the police wouldn\u2019t spend a significant amount of time trying to find a kid smoking weed.\u000a\u000aI thought I was safe, but about ten minutes later I heard shouts saying that they knew I was there and I needed to come out. I had thrown my bag into the woods earlier on, and when I finally approached the cops they asked if it was mine. I said yes and admitted that there was marijuana in there. They approached me with a near empty bag of weed that I left behind when I made a run for the woods The cops walked me back to my car and asked to search my bag, to which I consented.\u000a\u000aOne by one they pulled out hundreds of dollars worth of cannabis and paraphernalia. The contents of my bag included a grinder, a bowl, a vaporizer, a dab pen, about 8 grams of weed, about half a gram of shatter, about 5 grams of kief that I had been saving up for fucking months, and a bag of AVB.\u000a\u000aI was questioned for about twenty minutes, asked about my age, where I\u2019d gotten the weed, if I\u2019d tried any drugs before, if I was planning on driving home. I knew I was absolutely fucked. They threatened to arrest me if I didn\u2019t give up my dealer, but I refused. It was a classic good cop-bad cop situation, with the latter admonishing me and the former attempting to calm me down and telling me that it\u2019s not the end of the world.\u000a\u000aI explained to him what everything in my bag was, admitted that I was going to drive home after smoking (because I knew they wouldn\u2019t believe me if I said I was just planning on grinding weed), apologized, explained that I just use weed to help me to relax and emphasized that I\u2019m a hard-working student with no criminal  record and that I am attending college next year.\u000a\u000aAfter I had explained how this incident could literally ruin my life, the officers had some empathy and only issued me two local ordinance violations for possession of cannabis and possession of cannabis paraphernalia. I am lucky to not have been arrested, but now have to pay $500 worth of tickets and had over $300 worth confiscated.\u000a\u000aI know this could have gone far worse, but I am still shook several days later and since I am a high schooler working at a burger joint, this is traumatizing in a financial sense.\u000a\u000aTLDR: tried to grind some weed on a nice spring afternoon, ended up with a heart attack and a $500 ticket\u000a\u000aEdit: they also stole my Juul (even though it was legally purchased), so y\u2019all oughta feel even worse for me
p61
aVDefinitely not about the movement. At all. But get a mini vape pen like a juul and just chief that when you get the devils lettuce urge 
p62
aVHad a dream some dude robbed me at knife in the middle of a party for my juul, then i got laid
p63
aVblue dream, then we all took a walk in the woods and juuled lol
p64
aVTook the wax out of the dab pen and put it in a Juul pod.\u000a\u000a
p65
aVI did this and it worked well for a while, but then it started leaking... it was not a fun experience. Just make sure that you don't put the pod under too much stress or you will end up with a very sticky juul! Not fun.
p66
aVhow u do dis I really wanna try it! I heard about a company making aftermarket juul pods with thc in them in medical states!
p67

aVBoulder &gt; Juul &gt; Phix &gt; Stiiizy
p69
aVIn my experience what works really well in juul pods is the distillate mixed with some propolene glycol and flavoring. If you got this from a cartridge that's likely what it is already minus the flavor
p70
aVIn New York the problem seems to be more empty juul pods rather than vape carts. But there\u2019s definitely a huge problem with cigarillo wrappers EVERYWHERE
p71
aVI live in Milwaukee and my local head shop has a deal if you bring in empty juul pods they will give you a discount on your next juul purchase. 
p72
aVIs there an incentive from pax/juul to claim back used pods from shops? Or is it just a really cool shop, taking a small loss for less litter
p73
aVPax owns juul, as well as the Pax Era, a pod based oil device
p74
aVI work at a local bar and it pains me so much cleaning up the numerous straws, cups and juul pods off the ground throughout the night. 
p75
aVNo way I didn't even know they owned juul.
p76
aVPax created/used to own juul\u000a\u000aJuul split off sometime in 2017
p77
aVFirst hand info about health of weed vapes\u000a\u000aIve read about this a lil bit on the internet, and Im sure this topic has been covered here before, but I have concluded that I am on the fence about the vaping I have been doing for months now. I love it (though its overall nothing compared to bud) for its discreetness and convenience, but with all the hoopla about how bad Juuling and nicotine vaping is, the same questions arise in this field. I mostly use cartridges from a company that says "100% pure cannabis oil," and "Organic MCT and Natural Terpenes," which is reassuring information, but what are the cons, health-wise? I've read about polywhatever glycol and how oil may come from basically stale bud, but whats the reddit reception on safety for these products? Sorry for likely being post #45623 about this. Thanks.s
p78
aVI haven't tried the Pax yet, I'm a hardcore Juul user though. I personally can't even step outside of my house without it. If you do get a chance to try to Pax, let me know. 
p79
aV93% THC Distillate Juul Pods (\U0001f300~\U0001f300)\u000a\u000a
p80
aVA juul still has to vaporize it's nicotine juice shit bro. I'm sure this works no problem. 
p81
aVOn a serious note can anyone ship me and op some juul Pods. My moms credit card keeps getting declined.
p82
aVI used to, but I stopped recently and now have a Juul that i use every day. I rarely smoke anything other than blunts rolled in tobacco leaf wraps anyways so i doubt it was tobacco related. 
p83
aV\u201cwe don\u2019t even smoke\u201d, and when we wanna get together and smoke we say, \u201cYou guys wanna hit the JUUL?\u201d
p84
aVYou should look into getting a Juul vape. For the most part you're addicted to nicotine, not cigarettes, but cigarettes are what will kill you, not nicotine. Juul's are better than most vapes because they are designed for cigarette smokers. 
p85
aVYou\u2019ll be fine man. Got a 2 day suspension from school for getting caught with my juul like a dumb dumb (18, wasn\u2019t using it, someone snitched) and it felt like the worst thing in the world when it happened, but I\u2019m slowly coming to terms. \u000a\u000aKeep your head up mang 
p86
aVI agree completely. That nicotine buzz with the high is just... well... it's just fucking tits. I got a Juul and it's doing a good job replacing the cigarettes. 
p87
aVE-Mole lifestyle. Bust a fat dab then hit the juul and you'll be melting into the flood
p88
aVPut a Juul instead 
p89
aVWent from cigs and blunts to a juul and a dab pen. Healthier on the lungs and who needs to get out of bed to smoke?
p90
aVHaha I\u2019m at a [8.69) rn off the digital except just a juul instead and I\u2019m loving it listening to some Travis Scott, pure bliss
p91
aVYou should be able to put cannabis oil in there as I have seen people do it with Juul pods, not sure if distillate would be too thick or not tho.
p92
aVHmmmm, cigarettes are legal. Juuls are becoming popular with youth now. And they make nicotine vapes. Yes, for sure, nicotine is definitely being outlawed and treated the same.....
p93
aVI feel like I've read juuls pop up several times the past few days. Is it a vape or something?
p94
aVJuuls are like a super concentrated vape. Small, and high doses of nicotine. At least that's the way I understand it
p95
aVHate to burst your bubble but this is much more for people going and juuling/vaping in bathrooms during break period 
p96
aVNic buzz and weed go together well \u000aEdit - by this I mean I hit juuls or nic vapes pretty often when high. Never smoked a spliff or straight tobacco before
p97
aVMaybe consider a Juul?  Maybe you could mix nicotine and THC oil cartridges to get the same effect without the negative consequences of smoking. My buddy smoked a pack a day until he bought a Juul a month ago.  He\u2019s had like two cigarettes since and said they weren\u2019t enjoyable. 
p98
aVMy good friend got a juul. It helps with the craving to smoke and you can get pods without nicotine
p99
aVStiiizy or Pax Era fit in Juul??\u000a\u000a[deleted]
p100
aVDab pods for Juul's (illegal state)\u000a\u000aI live in a illegal state and my dealer said he was selling diluted pods for 15 and 99.99% thc for 30. Do dab pods work well?
p101
aVSounds like he is talking out of his ass. No such thing as 99% pods/carts. And what is it diluted with? Sounds sketchy. Legit juul pods from a dispensary are good. 
p102
aVJuul \u000a
p103
aVPax + some juul rips are amazing if you're a nic fiend.
p104
aVIts made by the juul dudes so it\u2019s basically a juul for THC. Rips. 
p105
aVOh man there's things are real... looks like a juul for concentrates 
p106
aVPax labs developed the juul but Juul has since becomes a separate company (I think) so they are related for sure.
p107
aVYeah that\u2019s the best part about it. Whenever anyone asks about it I\ufe0f just tell them it\u2019s a Juul.
p108
aVYou're missing a juul 
p109
aVA juul is now a unit of measurement.
p110
aVIf you've got 40nic in that juul and hit em both it should be fun
p111
aVIf you aren't using your juul to kick the stoges then you are in fact super gay
p112
aVThere have been these \u201cCBD juul pods\u201d going around at my school that are filled to the brim with synthetic marijuana. First seizure happened today, but it\u2019s fine because at least they weren\u2019t smoking the devils lettuce \U0001f602\U0001f602\U0001f602\U0001f602\U0001f602\U0001f602\U0001f44c\U0001f44c\U0001f44c\U0001f44c\U0001f44c\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBut seriously fuck you Jeff Sessions. Your policies are killing people.  
p113
aVI've hit wax filled juul pods but seriously dont fuck with the synthetic shit.. When I got caught up for weed a few years back when I was in high school I had to do drug classes for 6 months with drug tests every other week so I bought this spice e-liquid that I would drip on my mod. It got me high as giraffe tiddies but I shit you not I would be damn near hallucinating off the stuff, best to stay away from any form of fake weed and stick with the good shit we all know and love
p114
aVLooks like a JUUL what is that exactly 
p115
aVIt\u2019s basically a juul, like the replaceable pods and everything except it\u2019s not e juice it\u2019s wax
p116
aVIt\u2019s basically a thc juul
p117
aVThought you guys would like the new skin I got for my Juul\u000a\u000a
p118
aVWhat is with all the sudden influx of Juul posts? Can you even vape weed out of them? Damn teenagers.
p119
aVI have an ecig, usually use 3 nicotine. My friend has a Juul and I tried it the other day and almost threw up they hit so strongly! Lots more nicotine than I\u2019m used to!
p120
aVHave this exact skin and made dab juul pods a couple weeks ago. 11/10 would recommend 
p121
aVword i love juul 
p122
aVHow? I hate juuls but they look sick.
p123
aVI made thc e-juice using shatter and wax liquidizer. Then after filtering through a syringe filter, I simply put the juice into my friend\u2019s empty juul pods
p124
aVHe posted his juul skin with pineapples on it. How did he break any rules?
p125
aVThat\u2019s what it feels like rn. I took one hit to test a juul pod I filled and I still feel off like 6 hours later.
p126
aVAre juuls safe?
p127
aVHow is that weird it's nicotine same substance as cigs. Don't go near it because at the end of the day it's definitely not a good thing to be doing health wise and it's really addictive. Trust me I use a Juul now after having dipped for a couple years and it's damn near impossible to stop I get irritable and headaches. Seriously just don't do it.
p128
aVWhy the Juul is an ecig ask are/electronic_cigarette
p129
aVI guess I'm just confused why the Juul is mentioned on trees or vaporents as it has aboslutely nothing to do with weed
p130
aVJuul 
p131
aVOne bong hit for one juul hit...\u000a\u000aJust smoked with these kids from my town and this girl gave me one minute with her bud and bong in exchange for one minute with my juul... nicotine is a crazy addiction man... 
p132
aVBe careful man. Just read how juuls may increase the risk of cancer. But I guess the bud cancels that out lol
p133
aVah, i know i've heard mixed things. apparently juuls don't have the cancer causing chemical in it? according to the juul subreddit, (I know, reliable source) juuls have not at all been proved to give you cancer and if you tried to tell them otherwise you'd probably get banned lol. I need to take my juuling down a notch though because I definetly am feeling it in my lungs, that's why i'm so willing to give it up to other people now 
p134
aVMy school has that issue, kids in my school have almost fought me in the bathroom cuz they thought I was hitting a juul in my stall. Kinda sad to see high schoolers that don\u2019t realize they\u2019re hurting themselves with this shit. 
p135
aVPeople are always like juuls are fuckin gay only butt chompers smoke juuls but I found one on the ground the other day and bought thing of cartridges and I haven't felt the need to suck down a stoge since 
p136
aVWhat is Juuling? The Most Discreet Vape Pens in the World\u000a\u000a
p137
aVThc juuls?
p138
aVIt is the Pax Era, a concentrate vaporizer. Basically a juul but for THC. 
p139
aVDid you know that the Juul and this, the Era, are both made by Pax?
p140
aVSame logic would apply to the Juul but that thing took off like a rocket.
p141
aVWax / PG Mix Too Thick? Help\u000a\u000aI heated up about 3mL of PG and mixed in 1.3G of BHO. I put this juice in a JUUL pod (essentially an ecig) and it works. However, after sitting for a while or if it hangs around a cooler area, the juice solidifies. It may not be 100% solid, but the viscosity is way up there. After hitting it a little bit it starts to heat and liquid up, but I was wondering if there is anything I can add to the juice when making it to raise the solidifying point. I do not want to lose potency by adding more PG though. Or if anybody has an idea how to heat a filled up pod safely.
p142
aVI did a keif bowl and had a fuck ton of juul hits...[10+(\u000a\u000aI think I died . I might die send help.
p143
aVShould I smoke while I\u2019m sick?\u000a\u000aI have a stuffy nose and a cough, but the cough is much better than last night. I took some mucinex earlier. My throat doesn\u2019t hurt (it did this morning but thankfully it didn\u2019t last) and I\u2019m able to hit my juul with no problem. Do you guys think it\u2019s okay for me to light up?
p144
aVSmoking may irritate your throat, if a juul is a vape (i honestly have no clue what a juul is.  I dab everyday and thought I knew what was what....haha) then you can vape away with no worries.  Smoking with a bong will likely irritate your throat tho
p145
aVThat\u2019s one of the sweetest juul wraps I\u2019ve ever seen, where\u2019d you cop?
p146
aVThe small rectangular thing OP attached to his oil pen is a Juul, essentially an e cig
p147
aVJuul lyfe all day 
p148
aVI have a feeling that due to the slower draw rate of the capsule compared to the Juul this might not work as well as expected but still pretty cool 
p149
aVWhats with these Juul things?\u000a\u000aIt seems like every kid under 18 has one now? Why not just buy a real mod?
p150
aVMan, a couple buddy's and I made a 3 Juul 2 dab pen spliff over the break, called it the Gatling Gun. It's a pretty intense 1-3 minutes after a decent hit.
p151
aVNice skin on juul 
p152
aVJuuls, along with Phix's, Juno's all hit much differently than a traditional vape. A lot of people dont like the way a vape hits. But Juuls specifically hit a lot like a cigarrette. Juno's hit like  something between a vape and a cig. But these devices all have a MUCH higher nicotine content. Theyre great for people trying to quit smoking.
p153
aVYou can fill the juul pod with thc oil?? I'm not sure if that would work very well
p154
aVit's a juul
p155
aVAnd the juul has more nicotine than your regular e cig, and provides a nice buzz
p156
aVHow is the juul? i have been debating getting one to stop cigarettes but dont know anyone who has tried it.
p157
aVI love juuls
p158
aVGet it. Its the best I usually take moles (tobacco and weed in a bong) and never crave it because of the Juul. My cousin is a heavy cigarette smoker and showed her the juul. Now her and all her friends have a juul. Personally I use a sourin drop because juul pods are expensive. I know a lot about e-cigs so dm me if you have in questions.
p159
aVHey man, by chance do you know of any coupon codes for the juul website? 
p160
aVJuul is great for stopping smoking. That said, 1 pod is roughly equivalent to a pack of cigs so be careful not to up your nic intake. 
p161
aVi just got the juul today, im diggin it. last question, can i switch pods back and forth or do i need to finish one at a time? i want to try all the flavors
p162
aVJuul\u2019s are annoying\u000a\u000a[deleted]

aVJUUL Pod\u000a\u000a[removed]
p164
aVOne of my friends made a story on Instagram that said "yo pass that juul" or something like that, and I had my juul in my hand. For about 5 minutes I had my hand reached out, and kept telling "him" it was a mango pod.
p165
aVThat juul skin tho 
p166
aVHas he ever thought of vaping? Vaping would be a big help for him to get off the cigs(cancer sticks), look into the JUUL. \u000a\u000ahttps://www.juulvapor.com
p167
aVI would personally recommend you to get him to try it, he could possibly try it and enjoy it. Not to mention in the long run it could possibly save him from getting cancers/diseases from the cancer sticks.\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s some more information on the JUUL if you need more assistance on convincing him:\u000a\u000a\u000aWhat they are made of and how they work:\u000a\u000ahttps://support.juulvapor.com/home/learn/faqs/manufacturing-quality#materials\u000a\u000aHow the juice is heated, actual listed ingredients of what\u2019s within the pods. Unlike cigarettes you actually know what you are inhaling:\u000a\u000ahttps://support.juulvapor.com/home/learn/faqs/juulpods-juice#heating\u000a\u000aIf you can\u2019t help him to make the switch sadly as another redditor said, you can lead a horse to water, but you can\u2019t make them drink.\u000a\u000aGood luck, and please report back if you can.
p168
aVProbably rips a juul 
p169
aVFriend had heart attack and I need help\u000a\u000aFriend recently got a heart attack at the age of 18 and frequently did Vaping, weed, etc. I was worried about him and told him to stop but all he quit so far was using his Juul or anything else with nicotine. I\u2019m still worried about his health and need to know what is okay for him to smoke or not. I would like him to quit everything but I can respect his decision to continue smoking even if he knows it\u2019s bad for his health right now.

aVr/juul
p171
aVpax, maybe? although with the juul they are making crazy money off naive high schoolers 
p172
aVTry hemp wraps? It's like a blunt but hemp leaves instead of tobacco ? Blunt wraps could be hard to drop because the tobacco get a juul maybe ? 
p173
aVHow much would you pay for JUUL pods filled with oil?\u000a\u000aPurely hypothetical. How much would you pay for officially or unofficially made oil filled JUUL pods?
p174
aVPax, the company that makes the juul, came out with the Pax Era which looks and functions exactly like a juul but with oil. I read somewhere that the battery is ~$60 while the pods are ~$40, but I\u2019m not positive so don\u2019t quote me on that.  Here\u2019s the link if you wanna poke around some more:\u000a\u000ahttps://www.paxvapor.com/era
p175
aVIn my area, we have a couple of guys that sell pods like that. $20 for a Juul one and $30 for a phix since it holds more.
p176
aVa great day\u000a\u000aafter two years of smoking i got my first bong and smoked in my room with the window open because dorm life. now i'm sipping wine and enjoying its amazing taste watching the news and hitting my juul with no homework to worry about yet. life's good my friends\u000a\u000aedit: [4]\u000a\u000a
p177
aVIf ur in a legal state get a pax era it's made by same people who make juuls and it is basically a juul with weed pods 
p178
aVJuuling while high is so ethereal\u000a\u000aanyone agree? 
p179
aVThe fuck is Juuling?
p180
aVluv me sum juul
p181
aVHow I find my juul
p182
aVI like to rip my juul a lot when I\u2019m high and the other day I was at about a [7] and lost it, I was looking all over the room and in my pockets before I realized I was holding it between my fingers, then j just started dying of laughter. Good times. 
p183
aVMy man, good luck on quitting cigs!\U0001f4af get a Juul, they\u2019re ecig pens and they\u2019re good at getting you a buzz similar to cigs while taking you away from them. I\u2019ve seen 3 good friends fully quit nicotine overall cause of a Juul.\u000a\u000aBtw this Breakthrough album is pretty great
p184
aVI got a Baton and so far it has been real nice. I didn't want a big mod in my pocket especially in summer and this is perfect. real similar to the juul with a slightly larger battery and different pod design.\u000a\u000aGLK is one of my favorites in the experimental side of trip hop along with Prefuse73 and Flying Lotus. Prefuse keeps it pretty straight but FlyLo can really get out there sometimes as can GLK.
p185
aVBro I was at a 10 when I saw it and all I can remember was being super scared from the hippo and laughing my ass off when the rock said \u201cpass me the juul\u201d
p186
aVThis girl at my school sucked dick for a juul
p187
aVParents stole shit and now I found it what do I do? Please help\u000a\u000aSo Last week while driving to Colorado with my family  I woke up in the hotel room to find that my 2 evolves, cart, 3 juul pods, and Dab was gone. The next day I got diagnosed with the flu and since then I\u2019ve been home while they ski. Yesterday I found my shit and having been smoking it during the day but tomorrow at 10:00 AM we check out and IDK what to do, do I take my shit back? Or do I leave it? If it\u2019s gone they will likely know it\u2019s me cuz I\u2019ve been home alone all day for those days. They never confronted me about it though. Please Upvote so I can get advice, I need it fast 
p188
aVit's a [juul](https://www.juulvapor.com/) - nicotine, not thc, although it's made by the same company that makes the pax 
p189
aVAwesome. Yeah i have a juul as well so this happens to be very convenient. Thank you!!
p190
aVThat shit looks dank, let me know how it works in the juul
p191
aVNo he's correct. Juul don't use normal vape juice it's a nicotine salt that is less thick 
p192
aVUnless you break the lid, no it won\u2019t leak. Treat it like any other juul pod. .75g wax, 1ml vg is what I used
p193
aVHow many pods did that make? a juul pod is only .7 mL
p194
aVThe juul is super easy to refill, and there are videos online, the only problem is I notice (for me at least) that the pod leaks afterwards when you hit it. I got a suorin drop and it refills much better, but I'm not sure if you can put thc juice in it if that's what you're looking for.
p195
aVNice weed juul
p196
aVThe company that produces the Juul also produces Pax Era Vapes that work fantastic in my experience (have had one for the past 11 months without fail)
p197
aVA juul pod is actually 0.7ml. I was able to make 2-3 pods
p198
aVNo i mean more viscous, juuls juice viscosity is similar to your standard vape juice though its a lot less thick due to it having little amounts of vg. When you add dabs to the mix; whether its shatter, butter or what have you, it will dramatically effect the viscosity of vg turning it into a thick molasses like liquid. 
p199
aVThe only thing I dont like is how much it spits juice. Needs some type of filter in the pod like a juul.
p200
aVThat\u2019s not true. You just haven\u2019t tried with one in your mouth enough times. \u000a\u000aMy phone recognizes me with my juul and a joint in my mouth. 
p201
aVIf I smoke and then hit the juul (I know it\u2019s cringe) that\u2019s how i feel. Maybe something with the mixing of nicotine and weed causes that
p202
aVI was mainly saying cringe about the juul cause most people who smoke juuls are very cringy (idk if this sentence even makes sense lol [7])
p203
aVNah, I get it. I'm very aware of the stereotype, I just try not to immediately apply it to people without knowing them. \u000a\u000a...But... According to Twitter, all of Juuls customers are super girly, 20-year-old college sophmores who get drunk every day and hide both habits from their parents. \u000a\u000aI'm just glad that people started making fun of them and now I can "blow clouds" in peace, lmao. 
p204
aVJuul + dank bud = heaven
p205
aVRick and morty juul + pineapple hat = ultimate clout?\u000a\u000a
p206
aVI juul too dunno if that could be a cause tho 
p207
aVI heard the coils in Juuls release harmful chemicals like arsenic. I would hope though that after a decade of vapes in the market that they have found the best option for the heating element. 
p208
aVPods including cannibus oil?\u000a\u000aAre there any pods, for a device such as a juul, phix or anything else that have cannibus oil or something else to get high?
p209
aVI know that Stiizy sells syringes for their pods, so if you already have a Juul or like a pod system, you could just inject the syringe in. I would assume this would also work backwards, using the Stiizy pods with ejuice. However, I would have to caution you, marijuana wax requires less heat to dissipate, than ejuice, so be careful when you do this.\u000a\u000aA better alternative would be to get a mod that's able to take your normal cartridges and your sub tank for vaping, but that might be more costly.
p210
aVYou may just want to get a Pax Era. Or get another juul and fill your own pods. I tried sticking to one device, granted I use carts with 510 threading, and it got a little tiring having to constantly switch between nic and thc. It may be less of a hassle with pods though, especially if you only switch them a few times a day. 
p211
aVIf u do this with juul ik it\u2019s a pain in the ass leaks And fucks up ur juul 
p212
aVHempods bro. Hempods for the Juul. /u/Hempod and @Hempod on Instagram. Go to his website in the bio and purchase some empty pods and try that. This should solve the problem of wanting one device for both nicotine and THC or CBD. 
p213
aVI live in the US, but I'm still gonna answer. Back in high school (Just graduated this month!), I used to keep my pens and cartridges alongside my vape kit (nicotine) in an old PSP case. So whenever a friend would ask if they could borrow my pen, they would say, "Hey can I see your PSP?" And I'd pull it out in front of the teachers and give it to my friend.\u000a\u000aAnother code word we used was "Juul." We closed it that because of the meme where middle schoolers would Juul in their bathrooms, and one of the memes said, "Why are there toilets in the Juul Room?" And that kinda stuck. It also didn't help we also got Stiizy batteries, which we also called a Juul.
p214
aVSometimes, pssh, try every fucking freshmen in school was either hitting a juul sorin or some kind of mod like they needed the nicotine to survive at my school. You walk into a bathroom your blind from the vapor at least in class everyone was a little more discreet
p215
aVDepending where u end up if you decide to attend, it either gets way worse or way better lmao. Miami Ohio here, the place where the term juul is most searched in the whole world \U0001f602
p216
aVJust took my first ever two puffs of weed\u000a\u000aWelp, I just got my juul thc pods (from a dealer) and took two decent sized puffs. When will it kick in and should I puff more. Cheers. \u000a\u000aAlso here\u2019s some words: ir grape ape. 84 percent maybe thc. I\u2019m in an illegal state and I\u2019ve never smoked weed before. \u000a\u000aI think it\u2019s hitting me as I was writing this cuz I am having trouble thinking of what words to use. Lmao but thanks if you can answer my question I asked up there. \u000a\u000aEdit: been 20 minuets, feeling relaxed, I usually don\u2019t even need to look when typing now I\u2019m having trouble. I\u2019ve taken more small puffs \u000a\u000aEdit: been 40 minuets and I\u2019ve smoked a good amount and I can actually really feel it and ooo I feel good I turned off the tv and left the bathroom lights on and turned on the fan and I\u2019m in my comfy bed and I\u2019ve talked many hits and I\u2019m in this lil cocoon of love \u000a\u000aEdit: 50 minuets, eyes watery ish Idk? Feel great \u000a\u000aEdit 1 hour. Took many many hits. Soft cozy amazing. Good night fan on ;)\u000a\u000aEdit: 1 hour 4 minutes I\u2019m enjoying this for a few more minutes before sleep. My pen and cartridge are away in a ziplock in my pocket (I had to double check like 6 times. Eyes are dry. I\u2019m cozy and abt to sleep. I\u2019ll conclude in the AM\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s morning: \u000a\u000a9 hrs later. I had an amazing night of sleep, I kinda just layed in my bed, peacefully for a while, reflecting on what just happened. And unlike usually, I didn\u2019t care how late it was or how much sleep I got. \u000a\u000aThis is the first morning this year that I haven\u2019t woken up with a headache. Stress and anxiety and lack of sleep because of those things cause me to get migraines, and wake up with headaches. So amazing waking up and not having that horrible pain in my eyes and head! \u000a\u000aThis was an AMAZING experience and I\u2019m really exited to try it when I have a migraine (I have chronic migraines, most painful thing I\u2019ve experienced// not as bad as my morning headaches. And I\u2019m just overall so thankful I had a good experience (no anxiety! Think I picked the right strain!) \u000a\u000aPa: I didn\u2019t edit anything I wrote when I was high haha hope it all makes since... if you want to recommend any strains in the comments that could help with my anxiety, or my migraines in general, caused by anxiety, I would appreciate that!\u000a\u000aThanks to all!!!
p217
aVYeyeye, now that I think abt it it was cedar with hints of grape. And some mango cuz it was an old mango juul pod
p218
aVJuul is ejuice right? I wonder how the purity/potency compares to distillate carts; probably not very favorably.
p219
aVAccording to my dealer, the carts have better hits and flavor. Also because of the juul battery, it\u2019s not specifically for thc. I\u2019m buying thc carts next
p220
aVVaping Weed - First time ever\u000a\u000aI\u2019m not at home by myself and I would like to vape some indica (grape ape) tonight that I got from an online dealer (illegal state). \u000aThis is a stupid question: but will I cough too much and will everyone else in my house hear me (on vacation) ? Or will I be able to hold it in. Just need some advice, hope you all can help\u000a\u000aIf it means anything: I am able to juul withought coughing \u000a\u000aThanks \u000a\u000aForgot to say it\u2019s a THC juul pod!!! 
p221
aVIts your body so i cant say for sure, but if you take small hits and maybe even juul after you should be good. Water might help too
p222
aVwait what. You can get THC juul pods? How???
p223
aVTHC Juul pod 94% THC\u000a\u000a
p224
aVWoah does this actually work on a juul 
p225
aVI was just thinking recently about how great a thc Juul pod would be 
p226
aVPax, which is owned by the same company as Juul, has the Pax Era which is very similar to the juul in size and has THC.
p227
aVI totally thought the pax Era and the Juul looked too simular to not have the same cartridge. 
p228
aVThey are very different shapes and the carts don't work together. I think the point he was trying to make was that they are made by the same company. So the Era kind of IS a thc Juul lol
p229
aVI love sitting in class charging my juul, and the homie behind me hits me with that line.
p230
aVSo to everyone asking if these are easy, I can do you one better, look up the Kandypens Rubi. It\u2019s basically a Juul but the pods are made to be refillable and the coils are strong enough you can fill it with distillate and it almost works better than a pen. My local delivery sells them with 95% pods and they\u2019re incredble, highly recommend.
p231
aVSame with juul and most miniature vape companies unfortunately :/ I definitely think Pax is the safest option, they just make their pods fucking impossible to fill 
p232
aVthe stiiizy is the best 'thc juul' out there :) 
p233
aVHey I\u2019m PMing about the guy in Vegas who does THC Juul pods?
p234
aVJuul got too expensive for me.
p235
aVglad you figured that out sooner vs later. $4.25 / pod, 0.7ml / pod. 30ml worth of juice = $180 ion Juul pods\u000a\u000aI typically get 8-12 refills per Drop pod
p236
aVI\u2019ve been spending so much on juuls I need to switch
p237
aVOoze slim pen touchless battery... All you do is suck on the cartridge like a juul lol.
p238
aVOh God yes. I have a Sourin Drop (Kind of like a Juul, in that it is small and has a high nicotine content) and when I'm high I go at it nonstop
p239
aVbro bro bro\u000ais that a juul?
p240
aVLemme hit your Juul man please man just one hit 
p241
aVYa search how to use a juul pod without a battery on YouTube. Same concept but red wire in the hole and black on the outside
p242
aVCan someone explain the hype abt the juuls to me? They\u2019re just nicotine pens?
p243
aVIf you have a juul, pour the oil into a pod and hit it like a normal juul pod. Works like a charm
p244
aVthe trick is to start hitting the dab pen before you put the juul in your mouth
p245
aVFinally got a Pax 2. Bowl of black lime reserve, also a cucumber juul pod!\u000a\u000a
p246
aVI'm an Texan also. I feel you on the nicotine I need my reds.  If you want you can refill your Juul pod.  On the side there  Small plastic clamps that hold top to the bottom together is a small screwdriver to pry the part  YouTube it
p247
aVMarket Test: Empty/Used JUUL POD\u2019s for reverse engineering\u000a\u000aI am considering starting to sell empty/used JUUL pods and have some questions about how I should go about it (or if I should do this at all). Some exciting things can be done with these pods, and I believe that right now, no-one is selling these pods at all. Currently, I have one hundred &amp; two (102) pods in my possession which I purchased off the Silk Road 2.0, and I can quickly acquire new stock through some contacts I have. I would really appreciate any constructive criticism &amp; advice you can offer. \u000a\u000aIs there a market for empty/used JUUL pod\u2019s? JUUL Pod\u2019s can be modified to be refillable with other tobacco E-Juices or cannabis extracts/oils. The process can be completed in under two minutes and is relatively straightforward. \u000a\u000aThe Pod\u2019s sell for as low as $15.99(USD) for a four (4) pod pack. What price would you be willing to pay per a pod? Would $1.00(USD) per a pod (With the color cap) be a fair price? In what setting would you be most comfortable making this purchase? Would you online buy this off of the Darkweb, would you do this transaction via PM\u2019s on Reddit or would you want to purchase this from a private or commercial website [mywebsite.com (private website) or Etsy.com (Commercial Website)]? \u000a\u000aWould you feel comfortable purchasing empty/used JUUL Pod\u2019s with Cryptocurrencies (Specifically: Ethereum or Litecoin).  \u000a\u000aHere is a YouTube Video detailing how to modify JUUL Pod\u2019s: youtube.com/watch?v=5a9NjklJxYE
p248
aVThese pods are for the JUUL Vaporiser. The JUUL is specifically designed for tobacco use but can be modified to accept other E-Juices or oils. I think you are looking for the PAX Era. The PAX Era uses pod's like the JUUL but the pods for the Era have cannabis concentrates in them. Both the JUUL &amp; Era are owned by the same company (which also owns leafly.com) but are supposed to do two different things. 
p249
aVMy post here is for some market research to see if there is even a market for empty JUUL pods. I have 102 pods right now &amp; I can obtain more in bulk if there is a market for them &amp; the price is right. 
p250
aVI would be interested for oil. I don't do nicotine anymore but I would love to try some oil in them and see how they work. Empty pax era pods would be even better because we know they work great for oil but I would be willing to give juul pods a try. Juul was my favorite device when I Vaped. 
p251
aVThanks for insight. Going to start experimenting with a higher CBD ratio. \u000a\u000aWhere are good places to look for CBD vape oils and which type of vape I would use? This is still eh to me because I have a juul and batteries for my THC carts. \u000a\u000aI\u2019m thinking about trying the droppers to for CBD.

aVBest fucking weekend ever\u000a\u000aSo I started my weekend off by gathering my squad and going to my old abandoned house (it\u2019s kinda weird) with a Q of sativa hybrid and rolling 8 joints. The four of us smoked 4 joints and puffed on my dry herb vaporizer, then we went and met up with some other people. I went home shortly after and played some Skyrim before passing out.\u000a\u000aWoke up Saturday morning, went back to my old house and had a wake and bake with a twax joint my homie rolled, met up with my friend and my other friend who\u2019s also my dealer, smoked 2 joints and a blunt, hit my vaporizer.\u000aThen everybody went home so I scooped my other homie and we rolled a blunt at a construction zone, I accidentally left my juul there, then we went back to my place. Saturday night my homie slept over, we went for a walk around my neighborhood and smoked my last joint and a blunt he rolled, then went back to my house and hit the vaporizer while watching the Eric Andre show. Then we watched the first 2 Hellraiser movies and passed the fuck out.\u000a\u000aWoke up this morning to a breakfast of pop tarts and kratom. Dropped my homie off and scooped my other homie, went to find my juul (we found it, hell yea) then parked somewhere and dabbed and used my vaporizer. I got so incredibly high, shit was insane. Then went to McDonald\u2019s and got into an argument with an old couple who was being rude to us, then we met up with my other 2 friends and we all chilled for awhile. My other friends left to go smoke, while I waited for my plug. I\u2019m currently sitting in my car, stoned to the bone, waiting for my plug to come through and sipping my kratom.\u000a\u000aLife is fucking good

aVA Juul is an electric cig. It has nothing to do with this sub
p255
aVJuuls are fuckin stupid man. I vape and it's just so fucking stupid. 
p256
aVThank you so much! I\u2019m in college with roommates so it\u2019s good to hear about the less smell thing! This might be a stupid question, but is the Juul also used for vaping? It\u2019s just what I see everyone using but maybe it\u2019s just for regular nicotine smoking. 
p257
aVI have no idea what a \u201cJuul\u201d is. \u000aThat\u2019s one for the peeps over at r/vaporents  \U0001f601\u000a\u000aBut as far as the semi goes, if you wanna be 99% discreet, a good vape and having a session in the bathroom with the shower/fan going (both is a perfect combo) is a suuuuupr discreet way.  Plus getting baked and having a shower is excellent \U0001f44c
p258
aVMy friend had just picked up some shatter and a dabox. I took about 6 dabs and was rocked probably a [8]. I was going to a vape shop to get juul pods and I walked in and asked \u201cdo y\u2019all have tide pods\u201d

aVI may have invented something - I call it the "Electronic Spliff"\u000a\u000aHere is the concept:\u000a\u000aI have been using pre-filled dab cartridges for a few months now, you know those cheap-y plastic ones with the wick at the bottom and the airflow through a crescent shaped hole in the side. They look somewhat like [these](https://www.greenwellnesslife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/alternate-vape-pre-filled-cbd-cartridge-2.jpg).\u000a\u000aI am always trying to get the most life I can out of them. For a while I would just stand them upright in a warm place and let the droplets of oil hit the wick at the bottom. Recently, I have found that putting vape liquid into these cartridges once they look finished, it gives them a new life. I have found that if I use nicotine salt liquid, the stuff that is in things like the juul, I can get a decent nicotine buzz from these e-spliffs. Toke on frients, hope this could help some of y'all get high for longer and cheaper.\u000a\u000a\u000aTL;DR - You can fill up used dab cartridges with vape liquid and it gives them a new life.
p264
aVBro plz, let me hit ur juul 
p265
aVThis is actually the first time I've seen a juul in a trees post
p266
aVbought a juul for the soul purpose of having it when i smoked and let me tell you it was the best investment i\u2019ve ever made. nothing beats good weed and nicotine. 
p267
aVBuying Grape Ape - never smoked B4\u000a\u000aI\u2019m of age. Haven\u2019t smoked weed ever. Just bought two grape ape filled Juul pods (84% pure) from a guy I found on Reddit. Added him on SC, We talked a little bit, he sent me proof and everything, seems reputable. I sent him the money for two pods and told him to ship when I get back into town, that I would let him know when. Blah blah blah... anyway can y\u2019all help me out a bit. How many puffs do I start with? How do I make sure he didn\u2019t put like meth in there  (smell? Color? Etc.) lmao. And any suggestions before I start. Thanks so much, sorry if I would really stupid, again, I\u2019m a first timer\u000a\u000aThe reason I purchased this particular strain is because I have horrible anxiety. That anxiety leads to even worse migraines with indescribable pain. I\u2019ve tried medicine, it doesn\u2019t help. I can\u2019t do anything but y\u2019all lay down with my eyes closed when I have a migraine, it\u2019s terrible and weed is my last resort.

aVThanks! I just took a random sticker I had and cut it up to fit around the juul lol
p273
aVNicotine is definitely not the only thing in cigarettes that make it addictive. Like what the first guy said, nicotine on it's own isn't really addictive unless it is used in higher quantities such as a juul. What's incredibly addictive about cigarettes are the other many chemicals companies put in.

aVDoes Anyone Know If Oil Pods are Being Made For a Juul?\u000a\u000aOr if they already have, I don't mean homemade ones either. Thanks!
p278
aVThey make pods for a pax era I believe. Pax makes Juul.
p279
aVlol idk if it\u2019s like that everywhere but around me every gas station and convenience store has cigarillos, cones, wraps, anything u need really even juuls and pods
p280
aVHow might you make/get THC distillate in a state like Georgia (where i live) where it is illegal? I\u2019ve heard you can put the distillate in a JUUL pod and rip it like you would anything else. Don\u2019t slaughter me if i\u2019m completely wrong...\u000a\u000a[removed]

aVReview of the Stiiizy pod vaporizer and their CBD Mango cartridge.\u000a\u000aHello users of r/trees, today i'm here to post my review of the **Stiiizy vaporizer.** \u000a\u000a\u000aFirst, here are the pictures of vaporizer. \u000a\u000ahttps://imgur.com/a/QKSEx\u000a\u000aFirst and foremost, despite receiving both the vaporizer unit and one cartridge free of charge for the review, i already own 2 of them, and have purchased with my own money 8 of their cartridges before this review. So this is an **unbiased review**, I just really love their products and can't wait to see them expand to newer medical and recreational markets. \u000a\u000aFirst off, i'm sure you've heard of the Pax era, and other pod style vaporizers for thc concentrates. This product does the same, a button free, inhale to draw smoke pod vaporizer, that has a slim form factor and resembles something like a Juul e-cigarette. \u000a\u000a**The device itself is 20 dollars, and the half gram cartridges itself cost 30 dollars each**, except the cbd pod which is 35. Prices vary from dispensary to dispensary, but generally i've found that each half gram cartridge is 30 dollars. \u000a\u000aThey've just released **1 gram cartridges, which cost 55 dollars** if i'm not mistaken. \u000a\u000aThe cartridges are filled with solventless distillate which is unbelievably flavorful, lots of terps. Stiiizy only uses their own brand of flower and oil, so the quality is incredibly consistent. \u000a\u000aPictured, I have the mango cbd pod which has a 1:1 ratio of cbd and thc. I've never had a cbd product until this, and I can tell you that i really really like it so far. The cbd is really relaxing, and i love taking hits of it before bed because it just makes me feel so good and ready to sleep well. It's good when you don't want to get super high, but feel really nice. \u000a\u000aAside from this pod, they have hybrids, sativa, and indica, all of which test over 85% thc. \u000a\u000aThe charge on the battery lasts a decent while, and it easily recharges via microusb. \u000a\u000aIt has a 7 second draw timer, which is really nice if you want to take consistent hits each time. \u000a\u000aComparing to other cartridges out there, i'd say i prefer this pod style vaporizer over say a 510 connection cartridge due to the flavor, quality, and discreet ability to vape whenever due to the form factor. The distillate in my opinion lasts a bit longer, with no fillers unlike some cartridges, and the ceramic heating element within the cartridges create some great tasting vapor. \u000a\u000aComparable to say, a 60 dollar brass knuckles cart, i'll buy two stiiizy carts anyday. Often times, lots of places have deals on stiiizy products anyways so i'm always on the look for those! \u000a\u000aHopefully you enjoyed this review, I tried to come off an unbiased as possible, but I really do enjoy their products a lot, and have been loving them nonstop for the past month or so. \u000a\u000aCurrently, it's only available within California but they're looking to expand soon. \u000a\u000aThanks for reading! \u000a\u000a**edit: don't downvote, ents. you're being unnecessary, just let the thread be if you don't like it**

aVDude thanks! I use to hella make fun of juuls but now I\u2019m hooked 
p284
aVGet him a juul

aVI think that was just a juul, he usually smokes cigs during sets but I\u2019m guessing the venue wasn\u2019t cool with that.
p286
aVI\u2019m I med patient from ca flying to Chicago next month and want to bring my stiiizy pen, looks just like a juul... you think I would be ok? How should I transport the cartridges?
p287
aVAll through high school I smoked out of bongs. Definitely my go - to. And I smoked a lot especially my first year of college. Morning - bong rip, leaving for class- rip, after class - rip, going to work - rip etc... \u000aOccasionally I would smoke a joint if that\u2019s what was a round, and rarely a blunt, because those highs were just \u201cdifferent\u201d to me. Now, I really don\u2019t smoke at all anymore - I mainly started smoking dirty bowls , so with tobacco- and after I got my JUUL I stopped wanting cigarettes and tobacco altogether so weed went with it. \u000a \u000aI still once a month will smoke with my boyfriend, but only if it\u2019s a joint!!! I refuse to hit a bong now even though that\u2019s what I swore by. \u000a\u000aI guess it\u2019s all about what you\u2019re used too \U0001f937\U0001f3fc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\U0001f937\U0001f3fc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f
p288
aVLooks like a juul
p289
aVIt is indeed a juul. Trying to quit cigs. Started chain smoking when my dad was diagnosed with a brain tumor, then cancer. It's been helping out a lot so far.
p290
aVNow that's a juul I could vape in the middle school bathroom. 
p291
aVjuuls are so bad for you, also it depends i feel dabs make me cough way more than flower
p292
aVAll about the ratios. I'm not sure with you but juuls hits way harder than a cig. But you're right. A fat mole is like a different category. You can't blackout from a juul lol
p293
aVNahhh. If anything most people end up using it more. Same logic applies to the Juul, in that because it's discreet, there's a tendency to take it out and use it more frequently. \u000a\u000aAll the drivers and most of the cooks at my side job are using both throughout their shifts, as an anecdotal example. 
p294
aVIt\u2019s a JUUL a new way of smoking nicotine 
p295
aVdamn you got some fancy gas stations in your town... JUULs aren\u2019t high-tech top-shelf vapes, but you definitely won\u2019t find them next to bics and clippers at your local 7-eleven
p296
aVI'd argue that the Juul is one of the best E-cigs on the market currently. Granted I'm not a big user of E-cigs, but they are discreet, compact, and reliable. They juice in them is stronger than most E-cigs, and many smokers have said that the Juul is one of the only E-cigs that can scratch that cigarette itch. \u000a\u000aIt's not a box mod for sure, but it's not trying to be. It's a quick, easy, and discreet way to get a nice hit of nicotine. 
p297
aVJuul buzz + high af = full body orgasm\u000a\u000aDoing this is so amazing i recomend for you juul ents i even have distillate pods
p298
aVif u juul just put it in pods lol 
p299
aVMy jaw locks up when I smoke weed. Am I just being a hypochondriac or do I have jaw cancer.. I also smoked cigs for a few years and now just smoking a juul.\u000a\u000aIs this just me being a hypochondriac or should I actually go see a dr and ask him if I have jaw/mouth cancer? Serious question... I know some are going to think it\u2019s stupid
p300
aVI have a problem [9]\u000a\u000aEvery time I get high I use my juul because I love the combo however I always run into the same issue. I hit it a lot and I never really get nic sick but when I'm satisfied with my buzz I get the urge to hit it one more time. For some reason when I'm high my dumbass voice in my head keeps repeating "I'm a one more hit kind of guy" and I don't know why so I just take another hit and then I have the worst coughing fit ever. I get over it quickly and it isn't that bad though. I just felt like sharing idk why.
p301
aVI\u2019ve found myself hitting my juul after smoking as well. I try to shy away from it because nicotine buzzes can be acquired fairly easily where as I\u2019d rather just enjoy the high from bud alone
p302
aVJuul ent gang
p303
aVFirst of all you could get cancer tomorrow why the hell are you saying you won't get cancer if you wait 5-10 years from now ? Do you think you can only get cancer if your older then 30? Why can't you just quit cigs and only smoke weed? There should be no reason why you can't only smoke weed, cigarettes do not make weed more enjoyable. You could try switching to vaping / juuling, maybe your parents would approve of that.
p304
aVHey man your juul deserves to be pictured too! 
p305
aVMy guess is that the cops care about it about as much as they care about public drinking. \u000a\u000aGo pick up a Pax Era battery and Pod. And a couple more to mail back home. It\u2019s an excellent system, mostly only available in rec states, and from a cops POV, he can\u2019t tell the difference between an Era and a Juul(different divisions of the same company.)\u000a\u000aYou won\u2019t regret it.
p306
aVAlmost blew myself up...\u000a\u000aSo I am the biggest fan of pre filled distillate cartridges they are wonderful scent free potent things! I also have a box mod vape (im not a fuckboy) and I just use the carts on it bc 510 connection no point im buying one right? I was already at an (8.5) but I decided why not hit the tank so i did then decided I wanted to get higher screwed the cart back on hit it nothing happens for 2 seconds then BOOM like i just got a lambo revved in my mouth i saw a orange flash once it died,my sinuses and mouth were stinging a bit and had the taste stuck everywhere all was good after 30 seconds. 80w on a poor cart luckily it was almost empty i just put the distillate into a juul pod
p307
aVI\u2019m in the same boat- I had 1 (only one I had) almost fully grown in wisdom tooth out on Monday. It was a three minute procedure (literally. He waited two minutes after giving me novocaine and then pulled it out in under a minute) and I\u2019ve had almost no pain. My dentist told me I could hit my Juul the next day. \u000a\u000aSo I started hitting a weed vape (king pen) last night as well as the juul- I\u2019ve been not sealing my mouth around them, just inhaling and getting small direct to lung hits.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m super nervous but so far it\u2019s been ok. \u000aMy dentist said dry sockets are much more common in people whose wisdom teeth were impacted, needed surgery, or were otherwise hard to get out. He said my wound would be really small and I shouldn\u2019t stress about it- but ofc I still am! I accidentally hit a spliff my bf passed me last night and didn\u2019t feel anything weird either, but going to wait a few days before I do that again.\u000aGood luck with your nose dabs! 
p308
aVI had a super powerful gram cart on this dab pen that I took apart to work on a cart\u000aIt\u2019s all I had plus my juul for a weekend of skiing\u000aFrom getting high for eating and for fucking rapidly sliding on ice/snow it was pretty fun\u000a\u000aSadly tbh weed doesnt make skiing that much better\u000aBut it more makes (personally/me) you a pussy \u000aAs in super scared to go down steep slopes \u000aAnd I would take it way to slow accelerating for like one second and just parallel turning all the way to the other side repeat\u000a\u000aThe main reason is I got high with my buddy and could find the same intermediate trail as before and accidentally took the wrong turn\u000aIt had nothing to do with being high we just didn\u2019t remember \u000a\u000aIt was fun and no better feeling when i got down tho\u000a(Basically had to stop a couple times mid slope because my asthma was killing me and I got little panic attacks - not too bad just it scared the shit out of be to be on like a veteran slope as a person who hasn\u2019t skied in 3 years and did it for the first time TODAY) I picked skiing up quick tho\u000a
p309
aVGirlfriends son smokes weed and is completely unproductive and uncaring about anything or anyone else but himself. Got into it not long ago due to following the cue of what other kids do on social media. He has no life skills and it seems no ambition. It mostly stems from the over glorification of marijuana on social media. Im 38. When I smoked weed as a kid I also did other productive things.i did well in school. I was very active in sports. I didnt sit around smoking weed and staring at a phone and proclaim my own greatness. I hope in the next year he figures some things out because I have a three year old that wont be exposed to an ungrateful unproductive bad influence. He's out the door with zero life skills. He can sit somewhere else with his goofy and not so bright friends and smoke weed and get high off his juul all damn day somewhere else.

p325
aV1 week without a cig with my JUUL as of tomorrow. It is definitely the most comparable feeling to actually dragging on a cig in my opinion.  Blu never worked for me and I\u2019d tried several friends vapes. So far so good.

aVLil too pricey imo, they run like $50 for a half gram when I can just get a regular distillate/co2 cartridge for $30. I  have some \u201cjc01\u201d pods, they have a ceramic and ejuice coils. The ceramic will hand distillate cut with 5% terps easily. JC stands for Juul compatible, the pods are also compatible with the OVNS battery.

aVI\u2019m 16 &amp; I need a break\u000a\u000aI\u2019m 16. Let\u2019s just get that out of the way. Yesterday I was caught with weed for the second time. My parents are very liberal, and they don\u2019t mind people smoking, they just believe that it doesn\u2019t have a place in my life right now. Maybe they\u2019re right. I used to do it maybe 3 times a month, and that turned into once a week, then twice a week, then I was doing it more and more. Not only that, I used to strictly smoke with friends and/or my girlfriend, and now, I started doing it alone. It\u2019s become a nightly routine. My friends are starting to notice, my parents were suspicious, my girlfriend is starting not to like my habits, it\u2019s also starting to affect other aspects of my life. My motivation is dead, I used to work out, swim and run, I was in fantastic shape, but now, I\u2019ve quit all of my sports, and I haven\u2019t worked out once this month. I can tell if this correlates, but my relationship with my girlfriend feels like it\u2019s taking a toll. We have so many amazing moments, but we\u2019re fighting more and more. If we\u2019re not fighting we\u2019re getting high. My sex life feels more like it\u2019s about instant satisfaction rather than love, and that bothers me. My grades are slipping and I completely withdrew from my friend group. My new friend group, I love them, and we hang out without smoking sometimes, but honestly, we mostly just smoke. \u000a\u000aSo last night my parents smelled what we were doing, and that was it. They took half my stash, and my pipe. I was able to put the other half in another jar and give it to my girlfriend (who was at my house). They weren\u2019t mad, they just want me to stop escaping and focus on reality. And maybe they\u2019re right. That night I couldn\u2019t sleep. All I could think about was when I will smoke next. I stayed up until 4am playing video games (which I never do) stressing about something that should be a stressor. I hate how dependent and addicted I\u2019ve become. \u000a\u000aOne thing I credit to it getting worse is Reddit. 4 months ago all I had was a glass one hitter, now I\u2019m 16 with 2 bongs, 2 pipes, a dab pen, prerolls, a grinder, juul and sourin. It all started with the one hitter. I wanted a better way to smoke, and the one hitter looked like a good downstem for a water bottle bong, so I googled it, which led me to r/stonerengineering . I made all these homemade contraptions (many of which I shouldn\u2019t never smoke out of, check my post history). That sub lead me to r/trees, r/weed, r/pieces, etc. I\u2019m currently subscribed to 7 drug related subs. \u000a\u000aAnd the more I saw these post, the more I became a part \u201cweed culture\u201d and more I wanted to smoke. I started watching Eric Khan on YouTube, pot started becoming more of a personality trait rather than an activity. I quit my 2 jobs, and I\u2019ve been pouring what little money I\u2019ve had saved into buying glass, cartridges, and actual tree. \u000a\u000aAll last year (July 2017- March 2018) I smoked and got drunk. I quit for a while (March- August). Late August, gf and I thought it would be okay to start again, and I was. But these past 4 months, it\u2019s gone downhill VERY fast. It has never gotten this out of hand last year. \u000a\u000aSo what now? Well the new year is quickly approaching. I have 2g left (the rest is still confiscating). I have no intention of getting rid of my pieces, or my weed. But I know I need a break. So I\u2019ve sworn to not smoke until I have another job. The end of my grading period at my school is quickly approaching and I need to focus on that. My friends are all gone for winter break, so I don\u2019t have them asking me to smoke with them rn, but I\u2019ll have to tell them about my break. I\u2019ll save the 2g for later. \u000a\u000aWeed will always be there. I need to focus
p341
aVno i cant bc weeds illegal here and my whole family is very conservative andwould get mad if they found my juul. and there was a cop at the family reunion so no i actually couldnt.
p342
aVBrand of medicated juul pod is Honeypot concentrates
p343
aVI haven\u2019t seen a juul version in Michigan so idk specifics. Distillate is usually a strong high. Fast acting too. 
p344
aVFlying from a legal state to a legal state shouldn\u2019t be an issue. Last time I flew from Ca to Co I just packed my edibles and cartridges in my carry on. Put the cartridges in the tray with my wallet/keys/change and my edibles with the rest of the snacks I was bringing. My TCH cartridges look exactly the same as the cartridges for my little nicotine vape. My local dispensary also sells PAX cartridges and they look damn close to a JUUL cartridge. Most of the time they either aren\u2019t looking for that or don\u2019t care. 
p345
aVThey still are. Why do you think they are cracking down on juul so hard ? Just so happens they\u2019ve got a patent on nicotine salt extraction and aren\u2019t owned by big tobacco. 
p346
aVAltria (maker of Marlboro) just paid $13b for a 35% stake in Juul.
p347
aVAltria just spend 13B for a 35% share of Juul.  Big tobacco is trying to get more involved in the vape and cannabis landscape.  Cigarettes use is dying, vaping and cannabis are growing marketplaces.
p348
aVhow do they hit? like a regular juul pod? that's not a bad price lol i'm in manhattan
p349
aVStreet JUUL pods safe?\u000a\u000aI bought a GEM THC cartridge for JUUL devices and I haven't consumed it yet.\u000a\u000aThat post on the front page spooked me. Is it safe to use?
p350
aVNot sure of the mechanics of it, but i know people who tear apart phone chargers and usw the wires to charge their juuls and hit carts 
p351
aVDoes nicotine ruin anyone else's high? I used to love to hit a vape after smoking but once I hit a juul so much (idiot) I threw up and was really sick. After like 10 minutes I wasn't sick anymore, only I wasn't high anymore. Now one hit is enough to noticably weaken my high.\u000a\u000aWish I could fix this so I could enjoy the greatness I used to get when I combined the two but now I can't ... Like 5 hits of the juul and I'd be in paradise but now it ruins it. Like if I hit it enough to get good and buzzed when it wears off I will be almost completely sober. I feel like this is unique, at least in my friend circle.
p352
aVYeah I don't smoke any actual tobacco because not only does it make me feel bad but also it's so unhealthy, which is why I switched to the juul. Why everyone who smoks tobacco hasn't switched to vaping is beyond me. I forgot how good it is to be able to breathe effectively and I can actually run now. Vaping is still bad but for me it's worth the trade off. Personal preference though
p353
aVYo is that an oil juul pod ?
p354
aVNot that I've heard, but people fill juul pods with different oils all the time so I'm sure if you can mix cbd oil with some vape juice properly that you definitely can.
p355
aVIf you make tincture with ethanol or PG you can mix it with e-juice and vape it. I do this sometimes with my refillable pod system vape but I'm sure you could do it with a juul pod
p356
aVYeah, you can refill a juul pod about 2-3 times before the coil burns out. What\u2019s the ethanol for?
p357
aVLet me hit the juul son
p358
aVI rarely do it. usually when I dont have anymore juul pods and I want nicotine, I'll throw a bit of tobacco into my weed, about a 70/30 ratio of weed:tobacco. it just gives ya a good buzz and high from the weed. I'm also a firm believer that nicotine increases the head high from weed.\u000a\u000abut yea, 99% of the time tobacco will just ruin a nice joint or blunt. 
p359
aVWould it be the same if I hit the bong and then ripped my juul? 
p360
aVJuul?
p361
aVNah like /u/redeyenab said, its the Pax Era. I got it cuz everyone at my work walks around with a JUUL so no one questions it \U0001f601
p362
aVFind the one cousin with a juul and you\u2019re both set 
p363
aVI don\u2019t think they smell any worse than if you were hitting like a juul or other small vape
p364
aVThis was my cousins and I last night. I had the pen, my other cousin had the juul and there was like 3 other cousins coming up to us asking to use it all throughout the night 
p365
aVI've got a thc juul pod, so I can switch between my need for pot and my nicotine addiction seamlessly
p366
aVJust put the concentrate in an empty juul pod, best decision yet. 9/10\u000a\u000a
p367
aVHi juul pod
p368
aVNah I just be hitting the juul 
p369
aVI use carts when I'm out and about.\u000a\u000aIn confined spaces other weed smokers will notice and know what it is.\u000a\u000aMy current cart smells of pine. \u000a\u000aOutdoors no one notices. Just looks like a juul or something.
p370
aVAny juul/suorin compatible ones or do I have to go out and buy a new vape
p371
aVNothing for juul, but the Pax Era is really similar.
p372
aVI don't know about juul ones. But anything that can take a 5/10 connection like a normal vape should get the job done. You won't need anything extravagant. Doesn't even have to have settings or a screen. Just a pen with a 5/10 connection and a cartridge to match it 
p373
aVTry and find distillate Pax Era Pods.  They smell and taste like like Juul pods, downside is they\u2019re pricey.   However since you don\u2019t smoke a lot, they\u2019ll probably last you a while 
p374
aVNot a good idea. They have sniffer dogs in the checked baggage area. OP should put a SMALL battery and no more than 2 carts into a carry on. TSA aren't looking for vape carts, and will assume they are nicotine vapes. \u000a\u000aI recommend using the PAX ERA. They're kinda expensive but they look a lot like a JUUL making them incredibly discrete.
p375
aVSeconding this. Also, from a performance/use perspective, would the Juul system be worth getting into?\u000a\u000aNot horribly expensive, but I already have a 510 threaded battery thingy. Seems like there are more options that way and cheaper options as well. Curious to see if it is a better experience.
p376
aV3hours in and lemme tell ya, these pods are the best out of all the juul compatible oil pods ive tried doesn't burn quick and so far no leakage definitely will purchase more in the future 
p377
aVThey seem to be a bit cheaper than Juul and compatible pods. Will have to keep my eye out for them.
p378
aVI used my Juul for nicotine (living in an illegal state) for about six months before giving up on it for a traditional vape. It was really touchy about the exact way the pod was sitting in the device, had a short battery life (200mAh i think), and needed to be cleaned constantly to recognize the pods.  Plus it's impossible for me not to lose it constantly.  There's better small vape options, for weed or nicotine.
p379
aVIllegal country here :( Wish I could even by a Juul lol (Australia - illegal to buy since it's a vape product that contains Nicotine)
p380
aVComing from someone who quit smoking cigs last year and has smoked nothing but juul since i can attest that every time you buy a juul you have like a 1/3 chance of getting a really good juul that wont be finicky and doesn\u2019t fuck up.  I\u2019ve gone through like 5...  i now smoke a Vuse Alto, pretty much the same thing as a Juul but 10x more reliable and the pods are cheaper and last me longer than a Juul would.   \u000a\u000aAll in all, there are totally better options than the Juul lmao. 
p381
aVI may steer clear of Juul now. At least until I can try somebody else's. Not a nicotine person, though if I was I figure there are endless ways to go besides Juul. Pod based systems in general that lock you into a particular brand or pod type. This in comparison to a 510 threaded battery mod.
p382
aVThey're outright illegal, only way to buy is off random people who ship them over. It's pretty sketchy, especially since most are fake Juuls.
p383
aVThose carts are kinda booboo. However the wax inside is amazing. I would highly recommend using a syringe to put it into that juul works wonders. 
p384
aVBad highs?\u000a\u000aWhat are some bad highs you\u2019ve gotten? I\u2019ve mixed lots of weed with a juul and it was not fun.
p385
aVMy niece smoked for the first time with me the other day.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m sure some people will disagree with what I did, but I think I did the right thing. \u000a\u000aThe other night I was talking with my sister. She tells me she found out her oldest daughter B (15) was planning on smoking with her friends this weekend. She told my sisters boyfriend and explained that she was going to tell her mom before she did it. She was just nervous about talking to her, but still wanted to be safe and open about it which makes me so god damn proud of her. \u000a\u000aAnyways, my sister tells me this because she knows I\u2019m a stoner. She\u2019s worried about her kid smoking... like she knows her daughter is a teenager and she\u2019s gonna experiment but it was just hard for her. But she appreciated that she was planning on coming to her. \u000a\u000aAll this is going on as I\u2019m rolling and beginning to smoke a Dutch to christen the new ash tray that she\u2019d gotten me for Christmas. So I take all this in and put it out after a few puffs. \u000a\u000aI tell her that if B is gonna smoke, I want it to be with me. She\u2019s like \u201c... you would do that?\u201d Of course I would.. especially if she was planning on it. I knew it was gonna be a little weird, but I\u2019d thought about smoking with her before. Now that her mom is asking me, you can bet I\u2019m up for it. I also thought it\u2019d be a good opportunity for me to give her a talk about drugs in general. I move all my stuff out onto the deck.\u000a\u000aI say that I figure she\u2019s still awake, and if she is I\u2019m just gonna get her now. B is a bit of a night owl, just like her uncle. I go upstairs and sure enough her light is on. I knock on her door and she pops out. I tell her to put on some warm clothes. She\u2019s confused but she\u2019s game. So I give her a minute and she comes it with a hat and jacket and we head downstairs. She asks what we\u2019re doing but I just tell her she\u2019ll see. \u000a\u000aWe walk into the living room and she\u2019s like \u201cit smells like burnt popcorn in here...\u201d at this point I\u2019m smiling. Me and her mom make eye contact and she\u2019s smiling but a bit misty. She nods to me and B &amp; I head outside. I look at her and tell her to take a seat. She sits and sees the little table with a blunt sitting on it. \u000a\u000aHer eyes bug out and she looks at me and goes \u201c*i thought we were gonna watch a moooovie!*\u201d \u000a\u000aWe both laugh and I look at her and say something to the tune of \u201cthis might be a little weird, for the both of us, but here goes... I heard you were gonna smoke this weekend. If you\u2019re gonna try weed, I\u2019d rather you do it with me than your goofy friends. I know with me you\u2019ll be safe and you can see what it feels like without having to worry about anything. With me you won\u2019t be smoking somewhere silly or driving and getting in trouble or any bad situations.\u201d\u000a\u000aI explained to her that weed wasn\u2019t addictive but it could be habit forming. I told her that it has lots of uses, from helping with depression to helping you to get sleep to helping with pain. I described what being high was like and what to expect, and that she will indeed feel normal again. I told her it was also the reason I don\u2019t drink very often and never really have. I also made sure to mention that how we were going to be smoking wasn\u2019t exactly the healthiest way either, and that a vape is ideal. When I brought up edibles and not feeling that immediately she asks \u201cthen you just eat more, right?\u201d so I was happy I did. Saved her from a bad experience. I also told her that smoking weed can mess with your development before you\u2019re older, and that she shouldn\u2019t do it often at the moment. If she really wants, she can always ask me, and it\u2019ll be legal by the time she\u2019s 21 anyways. \u000a\u000aI asked her if she was sure she was ready to smoke and then we sparked up. She took about 5 hits and didn\u2019t cough much at all surprisingly. Though she told me she\u2019s juuled before so that\u2019s probably why. We continued to talk and look at the lights out on the water for a while and then we went back in. \u000a\u000aWe watched an episode of Rick and Morty and she laughed so hard, it really brought me back to the first time I smoked myself. I was 15 and with my big brother, he took me out of school and we went to wild safari and he busted out a jay. \u000a\u000aIt was really cool for me to get to share that moment with her like he did for me and she had a blast. \u000a\u000aTL;DR: taught my niece about drugs when I found out she was planning on smoking with friends. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p386
aVI got the backwoods juul sticker from (www.juulwraps.com) 
p387
aVYeah I know what you mean I have the same opinion I just question it at times because there hasn\u2019t been too much research on it to make that conclusion.\u000aFor example, Juul is allowed to advertise themselves as a \u201chealthier alternative to cigarettes\u201d until there\u2019s factual evidence that proves it isn\u2019t. And we haven\u2019t been able to study vaping long enough to truly make that conclusion

aVTHC Juul Pods Safe?\u000a\u000aI have used thc juul pods in the past but recently people have told me that companies use dangerous chemicals similar to those found in paint thinner. Does anyone know if those claims are legit or if thc juul pods are dangerous in any way?
p390
aVMy local plug has had some for a while, I bought 2.\u000a\u000aThe most dangerous thing is that they nearly broke my juul. 
p391
aVAre those Juul cartridges full of thc? When did they start making those?
p392
aVThis exactly, buy a juul man.
p393
aVHas anyone tried Juul to vape THC oil?\u000a\u000a
p394
aVDo you mean THC Pods that fit Juul? 
p395
aVThere are some people manufacturing thc pods that are compatible with Juul\u2019s yes.  
p396
aVBarewoods makes a great pod that fits the juul. Lasts about as long as a 1000mg cart and has a pretty good thc%. I\u2019ve tried them and definitely recommend if you can find them.
p397
aVYes you\u2019ll fuck up your juul, I know there are unofficial thc or CBC pods but I don\u2019t really fw any of that. What I have done before in desperate times is pour out some off the juul pod into a mostly empty cartridge to get that last little bit at the bottom and it works pretty nice.
p398
aVPax Era is made by juul I think it's refillable pods 
p399
aVCool. I assume it won't fuck up the juul itself. \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aBarewoods. Is it popular in legal states? 
p400
aVI live in an illegal state and my guy gets them from a legal state so I would assume they are at least available in a legal state. Also, no damage or noticeable difference to the juul after using it.
p401
aVMy Juul is a dab pen pussy
p402
aVJuul + pen = digital spliff, the future is now old man
p403
aVI dont think that has been proven but another reason to abstain. Its just trendy so kids are gonna go nuts for it. Just like juul's. Picking up the habit for social reasons.
p404
aVwho tf juuls for social reasons? You'd have to be a loser. It's for the buzz and boredom lmfao
p405
aVWhatever you gotta tell yourself man. Its trendy. Juuls are shitty vapes and getting a mod and tank is cheaper in the long run.
p406
aVThey also crackle, it's hard to get juice off of kids in the grade bc they all use juul pods, etc etc. I mean it CAN be done, but it's just like 5x easier on yourself with a juul.
p407
aVJuuls are not cuul in schuul 
p408
aVAlso, fellow stoners:\u000a\u000aDon\u2019t leave the end of your j\u2019s on the ground. Don\u2019t leave your empty oil carts on the ground.\u000a\u000aThe earth gave us this amazing plant and society made it taboo. \u000a\u000aJust because other smokers throw their butts and Juul pods on the ground doesn\u2019t make it acceptable. \u000a\u000aRespect the earth.\u000a\u000a (And for oil carts, try and reuse them if you can!)
p409
aVPut it in a juul pod 
p410
aVFirst time I\u2019ve seen a juul in this sub. Nice. 
p411
aVWhat\u2019s next to the juul
p412
aVWhat do you mean by a regular vape? If you mean an Ecig, not unless you find THC specific pods. For example, j pods are a THC oil pod that fits in Juuls. \u000a\u000aAre these coming prepackaged in cartridges, like 800 mg per 1ml cart? Or are you getting it in a jar?
p413
aVHelp with withdrawals.\u000a\u000aI never thought I was addicted to weed until this week, I went on a vacation and of course I didn\u2019t bring weed with me. I live in Canada so I can smoke anywhere any time and I do,  I have done so for about 9 months.  It\u2019s been about 48 hours since I smoked last and I\u2019m having extreme difficulty coping with life, I\u2019m on a dream vacation but everything is making me angry, I\u2019ve always been a happy dude but I am having a very hard time with irritability. On top of that the airline lost my luggage which contained my juul, so not only am I without nicotine I am also without weed. What are some tips you guys could give me to make me and this next week and a bit more tolerable.
p414
aVProbably more the nicotine I would buy nicotine gum or another juul and try to forget about it since you're on vacation 
p415
aVthe no nic is whats making you so irratible, pick up another juul if possible, great for weed and nic cravings
p416
aVYes, as well as from many smoke shops. Fringe benefit of this Vape is that it will be mistaken for a Juul 9 times out of 10. Extra stealthy means of getting high
p417
aVI too enjoy the pax brand, all my vape bros are like dude get a myly they\u2019re better than juuls and I\u2019m like yeah but pax makes juuls and I\u2019d rather give my support to pax because they get me high
p418
aVAnother time, i left my juul on the counter snd woke up at 2 to a text from my brother saying he hid it under the couch for me. My mom was sleeping on the couch and high me decides its a good idea to go search. Mom wakes up with me half sticking out from underneath the couch trying to reach the damn juul. 
p419
aVDid u purchase that ... Or did u use a homeade press that's an interesting shaped brick of hash  it looks like a juul made of kief lol I've  never seen one like that 
p420
aVI purchased it, that costs 5\u20ac. It's true it looks like a juul, I just think it isn't as big as a juul.

Should I bring it at all? Or will they even check. Thanks 
p424
aVLeave the juul pod in the juul, toss it into your carry on. juuls and other vapes are allowed on planes in carry ons, your just not allowed yo hit it on the plane (they wont know tho if ur in the bathroom).\u000a\u000aplus if they pulled the pod out and looked at it, I doubt they would assume its dabs, theyd just think it's a regular mint pod or whatever.

p433
aVOnly smoked 2 cigs. It was the ones with the crushable things on the filter and I've hit a juul.
p434
aVCan confirm. Best way to hit a dab cart is to not rip it like a regular vape. Take a moderately strong and steady hit accompanied with a deep deep breath and then hold it. Do that 1-3 times and you\u2019ll be just as high as ripping multiple times like a juul or something. Also be careful cause I\u2019ve gotten entirely too stoned from these things and looked like a gooftard in public 
p435
aVIf you or someone you know has a juul you can pour some in an empty pod and vape it like that. Doesn\u2019t work as well as a cartridge and it\u2019ll probably leak a little but it should still get you high

aVYou don't need to mix it. You need to heat the shatter on a metal spoon until it turns liquid. Then use a syringe and inject it into the juul pod. \u000a\u000aIt will most likely turn solid when it gets cold. \u000a\u000aNow you look like a crack head. Just smoke it lol.
p442
aVGoogle wax liquidizer for distillate. Idk how a juul coil is gonna react to that oil tho
p443
aVWhat is the best tasting strain?\u000a\u000aImo I like grapefruit kush the most but I want to know your opinion. The reason why is because I want to put some shatter, terpenes, and cbd oil into a juul pod so I can get the same smoking experience but more stealthy.

aVMy friend has become an absolute dick when he\u2019s high\u000a\u000aA really good friend of mine has started becoming a complete asshole after he smokes. I don\u2019t know what it is but yesterday after we smoked he started being a fucking fiend to everyone we were hanging with including me. He always gets energetic when he smokes but now it\u2019s going too far. He kept telling me he hopes I die, he wouldn\u2019t let his best friend hit his juul even though she paid for it, he keeps saying things like fuck the gays, and a bunch of other fucked up shit. He\u2019s usually always nice when he\u2019s sober but like for the past few months he\u2019s become a such a dick. Idk usually for me weed just chills me the fuck out and I\u2019m more nice but he\u2019s the complete opposite. Has this ever happened to anyone else either directly or to a friend because idk what to do anymore. \u000a\u000aTLDR: friend now becomes an asshole after he smokes and it doesn\u2019t make me want to hang with him anymore.

aVAnyone have info on GEM Juul pods?\u000a\u000a

aVWent to a psychiatrist appointment today. Dad suggested CBD to psychiatrist. Said CBD and juuling is practically the same thing and \u201creally messes people up\u201d so now she wants me to take benzos instead for panic attacks. It\u2019s been a long day.\u000a\u000ayep bros just like the title says. I recently tapered off Lexapro (pretty sure this is the around the 5th or 6th antidepressant that\u2019s been prescribed to me since about 8th grade) and have talking with the rents about ways to help my depression and anxiety and OCD without so many meds. I\u2019ve been working out which helps a lot and have been looking into trying CBD lately, dads on board with it, mom...eh kind of, but she\u2019s really easy to convince for better or for worse. Dad suggested CBD and asked psychiatrist\u2019s thoughts on it. She was not okay with it in the least. Said it doesn\u2019t have any research done on it and she doesn\u2019t trust these \u201calternative new age thingys\u201d like CBD  and \u201cjuuling\u201d. Says CBD \u201creally messes up people\u201d. I have made my voice clear that I am a legal adult now and think I should be able to decide what I don\u2019t want to put in my body, and rx drugs with heavy withdrawals are one of them, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna have a voice. She says I need to take benzodiazepines to sedate me instead if I feel an \u201cepisode\u201d coming to knock me out for the rest of the day. Self describes herself as a \u201cmedicater\u201d. \u000a\u000aBig Pharma is so real y\u2019all. 
p447
aVThis really irritates me... there is SO much research done on CBD and it\u2019s borderline retarded to say it\u2019s even close to the dangers of juuling. \u000aWeed could replace so much shitty meds prescribed to people rn but all the right wing conservatives won\u2019t listen to jack shit about it. More injuries, more pills, more money. And thus the cycle continues.
p448
aV&gt;juuling\u000a\u000a\u000aLmfao 
p449
aVCBD and Juuling are not the same thing. Her ignorance on this makes me question her medical knowledge. Shes clearly profit driven if she cant even be bothered to be knowledgeable about CBD. The medical field is frightened by the powers of CBD and the multi purpose usability it has. CBD has already scientifically been proven to help people with anxiety, and depression amongst  other things.
p450
aVYeah I'd question the intelligence level of anyone who believes that CBD and Juuling are the same thing. CBD has really helped my anxiety so I'd give it a try. Fuck what that psychiatrist says. 
p451
aVA Juul pod has roughly 60mg of nicotine; how that is similar in any way to CBD is beyond my comprehension. \u000a\u000aThat doctor is a moron. \u000a\u000aI was on Ativan for a bit before I discovered CBD and I'm very thankful I don't have to take that crap anymore, it makes you a zombie :/
p452
aVIf you have a juul, try putting that in an empty pod
p453
aVShould I trust CBD in an illegal state?\u000a\u000aMy local tobacco and vape smoke shop started selling CBD juul pods. \u201cThey contain no nicotine\u201d whatever I need to get pods.  Anyway, I\u2019ve been smoking them for a few days and they give me the vibe of \u201cBlack Magic\u201d which was a ecig liquid I used which was basically shit synthetic cannabinoids. \u000a\u000aCan I trust that this is CBD? Or am I just taking another synthetic? This is a different shop than I bought Black Magic at.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m really fucking high guys I\u2019m sorry if this makes no sense. \u000a\u000aIt leaves the taste similar to that of Black Magic too. I never want to smoke that synthetic shit again man. 
p454
aVIf you're going for CBD, don't use something cheap like a juul. If you're willing to invest 30-50 bucks you can get a bottle of CBD infused oil. It doesn't taste like candy, but it works really well.
p455
aVHere a small 10mL bottle is $40. I buy dab carts at that price. The CBD that come in a juul pod, meant for a juul is only $10.
p456
aVHe is the epitome of "bro can I hit your juul"
p457
aVI work with this guy who literally get's up from his desk every 30 minutes and asks if he can hit my juul. I bought him a new juul, and some pods after a while, and I kid you not, he never used it, and continually asked me. I eventually told him to fuck off, don't worry. 
p458
aVWe have one called RUBI here in Boston that also is a clear knock off of Juul haha
p459
aVpretty sure that\u2019s an actual juul with juul-compatible distillate pods
p460
aVHmmmm ok, so PLEASE, start listing products and names that are compatible with Juuls. Ive been thinking of buying those syringe to refill pens and put it in a used pod but decided against it. So any suggestions wouid help 
p461
aVWeed for juul???
p462
aVJuul gang
p463
aVI need a solar panel hack for my juul 
p464
aVPortable battery. Same principle as a juul besides the pod system; something you can charge, put in your pocket for later, and hit it by pushing a button or simply inhaling 
p465
aVEh, if you can't enjoy smoking without flavored papers, you should either grow up or quit smoking.\u000a\u000aSecond unpopular opinion: Gottlieb should really be focusing on taking Juul off the shelves - 1 puff of a Juul equals about 12 cigarettes worth of nicotine: [here's the math](https://www.reddit.com/r/juul/comments/5omwq2/actual_mgml_nicotine_content_of_juul_pods/?utm_source=reddit-android). I know it's one of the most popular vaporizers, but it's fruity, stealthy, and addictive af.\u000a\u000aAll I'm saying is I don't know how many kids in 2018 are twisting up loose tobacco into Juicy Jay handrolls. 
p466
aVWhat a douchy thing to say, so if I prefer to smoke a certain way which is different from you, that makes me immature? and I should quit smoking? lol. you sound like an asshole stoner.  \u000a  \u000aand if you goto the FDA site and read Gottlieb related material, Juul is in the crosshairs mr.stickinthemud.
p467
aVAs a college student most people my age all have Juuls and it\u2019s nicotine. It\u2019s crazy how much it\u2019s taken over. Rarely see dab carts in Juul pod form 
p468
aVI just call both my juul and my oil pens vapes. Whether I'm vaping weed or nicotine is up to anybody else's judgement. Most assume it's E-juice unless it's really dank oil that obviously smells like pot. Most people aren't even aware cannabis vape cartridges exist unless they're really common in your area.
p469
aVthat just looks like a juul to me?
p470
aVThe company that makes Juul (Pax labs) also makes a vape that looks almost identical to the Juul called the Era. (I think it might be a bit larger.) I've only seen one before but at a glance I wouldn't have been able to tell
p471
aVThe era is rounded more so to my knowledge and stuff. Juuls are so popular at college that without owning one I\u2019m able to recognize it immediately \U0001f602
p472
aVWelcome to CBDream the new Juul compatible full spectrum distillate pod\u000a\u000a
p473
aVYes but these Juul pods are ceramic and not the same as you have
p474
aVGood man I hope you're as baked as me right now. Been pacing my now empty house ripping dabs out my Juul. Just called outta work to do it some more
p475
aVGot some pretty good stuff at the moment\u000a\u000aAccidentally recieved an eighter of Ghost OG instead of Exotic Gelato, and a J-Pod (knock off of the Juul Pods) the fits my Juul, filled with 600mgs of Wedding Cake [Hybrid]. The Ghost OG is purple af and the high is pretty good too, major munchy attacks. A sweet and Earthy smell, with accomadating taste sends me back to when I first started smoking with my best friend of 12 years since then. Hope all you Ents are having a groovy day! \U0001f919
p476
aVNice I was gonna try the juul pods but im really lovin smokin herb atm
p477
aVDid I waste wax or am I good?\u000a\u000a**TLDR at bottom** So i'm chillin with my friends rn (also did adderall which is why im up this early) hittng dab pens and watching spongebob. suddenly some shit happened where some dumbass held the button too long and the vape overheated and now it don't work. Or its out of battery I cant really tell but we no bring charger so its irrelevant. My boy brought some wax just in cade he needed to refill, so we decided to put some wax in a juul pod. The juul still had liquid in it but it was almost empty (like 1/4 the way full.) Did I just waste wax or does this actually work. ***Also don't say i already sound stoned, Im stoned from before when the pen actually worked.***  \u000a  \u000a**TLDR: Put wax inside of an almost empty juul pod, wondering if it will actually work or if I just wasted wax.**
