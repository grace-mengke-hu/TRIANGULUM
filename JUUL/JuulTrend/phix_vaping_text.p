VBuy a phix! It's more expensive than traditional vaping but still a lot cheaper than cigarettes. It runs on a pod system, 1 pod lasts me about 3 days and I hit it constantly. You can buy a pack of 4 pods for 21.99 online if you find the right place and it is really discrete! I sit at my computer with my stepdad behind me and use the spearmint flavor and just chew gum. Can't smell or hear anything and ghosting the hits are really easy. Good luck!

aVif you are wanting something small I would say a phix which is really just a bigger version of the juul but I would say the best thing to do is just go into a local shop and look at some starter kits they have so u can actually look and hold them things like that and see if it is something that your brother would like. There area ton of starters out there now that dont cost a ton just the matter of finding the right one that is right for you. I am sure that there is someone that can help you more then I can.

aVThere are so many better and cheaper alternatives to a juul. If you\u2019re interested in pod system vaporizers with high levels of nicotene, check out the limitless pulse, aspire brez, or even the phix. And as for the juice, Mr salt eliquid is fairly cheap and it is salt based (also know as nicotene in its acidic form) from 25-45mg.

p13
aVI wouldn't recommend the T18 because 45 nic salt will literally make you choke. I have always been a big fan of Phix by MLV but you can't really fill your own juice. So I recently just picked up the iCare 2 which has been working really well for me, I am using nic salt 50 mg. Yes, coils for the iCare 2 is some what inconsistant, but it has been helping me save a lot of money and when the coil is working right, it's amazing. I would say 3 - 4 out of 5 works great and 1 - 2 defective. Also check out Aspire Breeze, a lot of my friends use them and seems to like them. The newest one that I saw is the Vaperesso, forgot the model but it looks like a sport car key fob with carbon fiber wrapping. Hope this helps

aVhelp!! accidentally checked my phix at airport
p15
aVyes, this is what I figured. I guess most of my worry was that since the phix is such a unique looking e-cig that they wouldn\u2019t find it/see it in the x-ray. I\u2019m at my layover now, though, and the plan never blew up, nor did my parents receive a call from TSA about their son\u2019s attempt at terrorism by vape, so I think I\u2019ll be okay.

p17
aVJuul vs. PHIX
p18
aVI\u2019ve had both so I can inform you on things with these two. First off with the pods, the Juul has way better flavor and the pods are cheaper, but they contain almost 1ml less than Phix pods. The juul has a smoother delivery while the phix hits harsher, but both give you that instant chill effect. Juul is smaller, phix is bigger. Juul is also louder when drawing, if that matters at all to you. I prefer the Juul over the Phix but either one is a good choice. 
p19
aVSounds like pods are for you. Please **don't** get any Smok products. Though I have not used one, I would suggest Phix, Juul or Sourin Air. I'm sure the more experienced ones will chime in.
p20
aVThis was my first too! Wasn't able to quit smoking until I bought myself a Phix tho.
p21
aVWhat about flavor? I've since purchased a phix. This thing tastes like a shitty rda or a decent sub ohm tank. It's crazy. Of course, it's proprietary pods/juice. But I taste melon.
p22
aVHow do you get that sticker on the phix
p23
aVI just got the phix.  It\u2019s very discreet and pretty powerful for a quick fix of nicotine 
p24
aVI bought a phix for longer rides where I can't drip and it's been supplementing really well. Luckily I know the length of the lights on my way to work in the morning so dripping isn't much of an issue. If I don't have my coffee and nicotine on my ride in I'm an irritable little shit lol
p25
aVI love all the new pod system, however the Juul is not as good as the PHIX by MLV. I think until today with all these pod system products on the market, the PHIX is still the best. 
p26
aVWhat juice do you use in it?\u000a\u000aI ordered some 40 and 45mg salt e juice and I am worried that it might be too strong because I hear the Sauron air hits harder than the phix or juul.
p27
aVChest Pain When Hitting Vuse, Phix, Penguin, etc.
p28
aVYeah I know what you mean.\u000a\u000aHonestly I'd say your best bet is to stay with the juul or get a phix or something else with salt nic because it is the closest to a cigarette that your gonna get.
p29
aV100 percent get a juul or a phix for Ur mum.\u000a\u000aThey use salt nicotine which absorbs faster and has better throat hit like a cigarette and it uses pods so it's extremely simple to use and there won't be any problems usually.
p30
aVAfter breaking 4 Juuls, I switched to the Phix, which I actually liked better, until it broke. Now I'm vaping on an Aspire Plato. The juice in a Juul/Phix is definitely more satisfying when trying to get off tobacco, I personally would say wait until after the cravings end before you try and switch to something that is going to give you a straight to lung hit because it doesn't resemble a cig as much as the mouth the lung high nic hits do 
p31
aVI have personally never liked a tank/mod mouth to lung setup nearly as much as the Phix or Juul and there is only like one company that sells juice remotely close to the juice you are currently vaping in the pods. Just letting you know before you try to upgrade or whatever and can't get nearly as good of a hit
p32

p33
aVThe Phix has bigger pods more airflow, bigger hit/cloud, same juice but better flavors, and it's cheaper and the charging works better, IMO. You could theoretically find the 5% salt juice online and put it in some kind of mouth-to-lung Vape setup but after going through that it will hit about the same as the pod set up did. Or you could try sub-ohming like 12 mg if you really want to rape your throats and get that quick nic 
p34
aVget a phix
p35
aVI tried a bo and a phix at my local shop and ended up going with the phix for a few reasons. It has a higher nicotine strength and the draw is a lot more restricted, very similar to a cig. I think both are fine but I'm getting amazing battery life out of the phix. A few drags and I'm all nicced up 
p36
aVThanks! I ordered a nautilus 2 tank to try it out, but if I'm not happy I'll look into the phix
p37
aVJuul pod contains "50" mg of nicotine in each pod per milligram of juice. I am not sure if they are using Nic salt, but I own a couple of Phix by MLV and I am hooked on the nic salt liquids. I recently just purchased the Eleaf iCare 2 which you can fill your own nic salt juices and the store by my house carries many freat flavors from popular brands that I can trust. So far I am loving it. I also have a few friends who uses Juuls on their daily basic but converted to the Eleaf iCare 2 because it's so much cheaper and last way long. The iCare last almost 2 days per charge and a 30ml bottle of Nic salt liquid is about $25 - $30. A bottle of 30 ml can lasts me up to 3 weeks. So I think you're looking to get a MTL device, the iCare is a device I recommend. It'a just about twice the size of a Juul but same length.
p38
aVMy local shops seem to favor phix over juul. I picked one up last week and honestly I'm a pretty big fan. 
p39
aVI still have regular box mods and I\u2019ve also started using the Phix it\u2019s a bigger version of the Juul 
p40
aVGetting A Phix
p41
aVI personally don't own the pulse but I have used it a good amount. I like pulse more than any other pod system (myjet, juul, phix, etc.) But I personally prefer the mi-one just because I rather fill with my own juice. I don't have any cons other than because of its size the coil is easy to flood. If you do like pod systems however, mi-one has developed their own pods so I recommend you check those out!
p42
aVYe I can't reccomend a juul or phix enough they are both good.
p43
aVWhere to buy Phix pods?
p44
aVGet a phix or a juul for those cravings.\u000a\u000aIt uses 50mg nicotine salts so it feels exactly like a cigarette I haven't even used my mod in a few days
p45
aVPhix Dry Hitting??
p46
aVGET A JUUL OR A PHIX I swear to god my phix has saved my life.
p47
aVYea  just got the phix no more clouds
p48
aVugh i have the phix, its way worse than the juul, but my juul got stolen XD\u000a
p49
aVI'd *HIGHLY* recommend a phix or a juul for your father and maybe a vaporesso revenger for yourself.
p50
aVYe I'm talking about the juul and the phix specifically.\u000a\u000aThey are really similar to a cigarette and they both use 52mg with nicotine salts which means it's slot more like a cigarette throat hit/buzz and also they look really nice and are compact
p51
aVHave you ever heard of a Juul or a phix?
p52
aVsmallest they come is cartridge based devices like the JUUL and the Phix by MLV.\u000a\u000athat being said, there are plenty of small all-in-one vapes that are great for concealment.\u000a\u000athe Eleaf Icare, Smok Vape pen 22, wismec MY JET\u000a\u000athis totally depends on preference.\u000a\u000aJUUL and PHIX both use high concentrations of Nicotine Salts, which have twice as much of a nicotine hit, just alot smoother than free base.\u000a\u000aDo a little research and find which one is best for you.
p53
aVTry the phix by mlv hits a lot softer. Good pod flavors and a charger thats cool and works very well
p54
aVI suggest looking on YouTube and search for review shootouts. Search \u000aJUUL, my von erl, phix, Bo, cig-a-likes, Penguin, Aurora, iCare, Breeze. Others will also pop up as you watch. Personally, refillable ones I feel are the more economical option.
p55
aVThanks for the heads up. I was planning on ditching it anyways and getting a juul or Phix instead. 
p56
aVIt's gonna be kind of hard to say no starter kits since it's an all in one device.\u000a\u000a[The Smok Vape Pen 22](http://www.smoktech.com/kit/vape-pen-22) has a similar design, but a produces slightly more Vapor.\u000a\u000aIf you wanted to go even stealthier than that, I would recommend using nicotine salts in a [eleaf icare](http://www.eleafworld.com/icare/) or pod based devices like the [JUUL](https://www.juulvapor.com) and [Phix](http://www.majorleaguevapers.com/phix-starter-kit/).\u000a\u000aLet me know which one you like and I'll tell you about each and every one of them\u000a\u000a

aVThc infused juul/phix pods
p59
aVGet a phix or a juul. I've been using my phix for quite some time now and see no reason to smoke anymore. It uses 50nic (5%). Can't say the pods are the cheapest things in the world though.  
p60
aVMaybe the [Limitless Pulse](http://www.myvaporstore.com/Limitless-Mod-Co-Pulse-Pod-System-Starter-Kit-p/lim-pul10.htm), Or the [MLV Phix](http://www.myvaporstore.com/MLV-PHIX-Pod-System-Starter-Kit-p/mlv-phx10.htm)?

aVPhix not producing vapor, plz help!
p62
aVHey guys so I bought the Phix 4 days ago and it has been working fine until very recently. It charges fine and lights up when I inhale but doesn't make any vape. I tinkered around a bit and noticed that the one gold pin is lower than the other (picture is bad sorry). I think it may not be making a good connection with the pod. Anyone have any ideas or advice? 
p63
aVI don't have a phix but I do have a juul. What I did to fix it was clean it with a q tips and isopropyl alcohol. With the pin issue I'd probably try and press the pin down slightly and see if it moves. If it can try to move it until it is level with the other pin.
p64
aVHow long does a phix pod last?
p65
aVPhix by MLV
p66
aVi went ahead and googled phix for you and found your problem\u000a\u000a"There was some moisture on the inside of my PHIX pod pack. What should I do?"\u000aPHIX pods subject to excessive humidity or a drastic altitude change (like flying on a plane) may experience a minor amount of condensation or leakage. If your PHIX pod leaks, it's best to avoid direct contact with the liquid, but if you get liquid on your hands simply wash with soap and water. You may continue to use a PHIX pod if some liquid has escaped, but carefully wipe the juice off with a clean cloth or tissue before inserting into your device. If leaking persists, please contact the PHIX Care team.
p67
aVI would suggest getting a quick cigalike (juul, phix, cync, myjet, icare) with 25-50mg salt NIC juices.\u000a\u000aHits the cravings dead on when your really wanting to pick up a cancer stick
p68
aVQuestions about the phix
p69
aVNice! I'm thinking of getting a phix but the icare is super cheap! However the phix has way more nicotine so I'm on the fence 
p70
aVThe phix needs more flavors...
p71
aVMods from left to right; wimsec rx200, geek vape karma kit, phix. \u000aJuices; artic blast and green apple. From vapejoose.com\u000aDon't judge me for my phix it's for when I'm at work. We have a smoking room and I can't\u200b have clouds
p72
aVJuul or Phix?
p73
aVI didn't like any of the Phix flavors. While I do like three of the JUUL flavors.
p74
aVPhix.. because it's easier to find pods.
p75
aVI would say a phix or a juul but they both take pods\u000aTry the emili vape kit it is what I started with it works great there is an option to choose a button or non button 
p76
aVMy friend just bought a phix
p77
aVUse the phix or an I care mini with high nic there is some mr salty e liquid that delivers real high nic I have tried it on 45 mg and it hits your system quick and will adjust your cravings, with the I care , the phix is a pod system and I think it goes to 50 mg , I use big tanks and create huge amounts of vapour on high watts but for being discreet and getting the hit use one of the above 
p78
aVVape Mail ! Phix by MLV
p79
aVPhix by Mlv is closed loop system similar to juul but i heard really good things about it so i decided to test it out let me know if any of you guys are familiar with this device if so let me know what you think of it !
p80
aVThere's going to be a ton of devices that will be releasing soon so you shouldn't worry about it.  What's current on the market are:\u000aJuul\u000aMyjet\u000aVon Erl\u000aPhix\u000aBo\u000aFITT\u000aThese are your options, my preference would be Juul, Myjets &amp; Von Erl.  I find these pretty easy to use, and delivery for all is great!  Von Erl &amp; Myjet is cost friendly so you don't have to spend much.  More money you save on a device so you can spend it on the liquid!  Research them to see which would best fit you. Spend sometime researching on liquid tho, I would definitely look into something with Nicotine Salt because it goes best with these devices.
p81
aVPHIX! Thought the Pax Juul was good? This thing is ten times better.
p82
aVHometown hero makes 20mg (also infzn by Brewell mfg, the guys who make the phix. They make an 18mg) other than that you\u2019d have to look at companies like cloudberryvapors or elite elixirs, which the juice is made upon request.\u000aI feel the same though, U.S juice companies should make 20mg 
p83
aVI'll let you decide if any of these are fast/easy but search for "youtube refill mark ten elite podss" gives lots of results.\u000a\u000aSearch for "youtube refill phix pods" also gives lots of results.\u000a\u000aSome say the Phix and Elite are not the same even though they look identical. IDK, don't have either one, just couldn't let this post go unanswered.
p84
aVI do! I basically haven't touched any of my other vapes since getting the Alto. It has the smoothest, quietest, and most satisfying out of all the pod systems I've tried (Juul, Phix, Myle, plus various refillables). I use the mixed fruit pods which aren't the greatest tasting (Phix blue raspberry gets that accolade), but it's a fair trade off. Love my Alto. 
p85
aVI picked up a novo recently. I was a steady juul guy and I bought other pod devices in the past (breeze 2, phix) which I hated. The novo has been very solid in my replacement for the juul since it\u2019s so similar. I\u2019d recommend 
p86
aVMy sister uses a Phix and she loves it. she said the only good flavors are hard strawberry and blue raspberry. 
p87
aVKwit Stick is my favorite and I have tried many. Fair warning, the tobacco flavor is trash and always prime the pod after refill, if you don't then it burns the wick and ruins the pod, I'm currently getting 6+ refills per pod. Other than that the hits are strong and consistent, no leaks, FAST charging and its cheap to use. They give you 10% off your first order and frequently send you emails for 10% coupon codes if you buy from their site rather than a wholesaler. They screwed up my order once but sent the missing item same day with no questions asked. Highly recommended over Juul, Ziip, Phix, Fit, Inifinix, Drop, and myBlu.
p88
aVBuy a phix! It's more expensive than traditional vaping but still a lot cheaper than cigarettes. It runs on a pod system, 1 pod lasts me about 3 days and I hit it constantly. You can buy a pack of 4 pods for 21.99 online if you find the right place and it is really discrete! I sit at my computer with my stepdad behind me and use the spearmint flavor and just chew gum.

aVAfter breaking 4 Juuls, I switched to the Phix, which I actually liked better, until it broke. Now I'm vaping on an Aspire Plato. The juice in a Juul/Phix is definitely more satisfying when trying to get off tobacco, I personally would say wait until after the cravings end before you try and switch to something that is going to give you a straight to lung hit because it doesn't resemble a cig as much as the mouth the lung high nic hits do 
p119
aVI have personally never liked a tank/mod mouth to lung setup nearly as much as the Phix or Juul and there is only like one company that sells juice remotely close to the juice you are currently vaping in the pods. Just letting you know before you try to upgrade or whatever and can't get nearly as good of a hit

p121
aVThe Phix has bigger pods more airflow, bigger hit/cloud, same juice but better flavors, and it's cheaper and the charging works better, IMO. You could theoretically find the 5% salt juice online and put it in some kind of mouth-to-lung Vape setup but after going through that it will hit about the same as the pod set up did. Or you could try sub-ohming like 12 mg if you really want to rape your throats and get that quick nic

aVget a phix
p123
aVI tried a bo and a phix at my local shop and ended up going with the phix for a few reasons. It has a higher nicotine strength and the draw is a lot more restricted, very similar to a cig. I think both are fine but I'm getting amazing battery life out of the phix. A few drags and I'm all nicced up 
p124
aVThanks! I ordered a nautilus 2 tank to try it out, but if I'm not happy I'll look into the phix
p125
aVJuul pod contains "50" mg of nicotine in each pod per milligram of juice. I am not sure if they are using Nic salt, but I own a couple of Phix by MLV and I am hooked on the nic salt liquids. I recently just purchased the Eleaf iCare 2 which you can fill your own nic salt juices and the store by my house carries many freat flavors from popular brands that I can trust. So far I am loving it. I also have a few friends who uses Juuls on their daily basic but converted to the Eleaf iCare 2 because it's so much cheaper and last way long. The iCare last almost 2 days per charge and a 30ml bottle of Nic salt liquid is about $25 - $30. A bottle of 30 ml can lasts me up to 3 weeks. So I think you're looking to get a MTL device, the iCare is a device I recommend. It'a just about twice the size of a Juul but same length.
p126
aVMy local shops seem to favor phix over juul. I picked one up last week and honestly I'm a pretty big fan. 
p127
aVI still have regular box mods and I\u2019ve also started using the Phix it\u2019s a bigger version of the Juul 
p128
aVGetting A Phix
p129
aVI personally don't own the pulse but I have used it a good amount. I like pulse more than any other pod system (myjet, juul, phix, etc.) But I personally prefer the mi-one just because I rather fill with my own juice. I don't have any cons other than because of its size the coil is easy to flood. If you do like pod systems however, mi-one has developed their own pods so I recommend you check those out!
p130
aVYe I can't reccomend a juul or phix enough they are both good.
p131
aVWhere to buy Phix pods?
p132
aVGet a phix or a juul for those cravings.\u000a\u000aIt uses 50mg nicotine salts so it feels exactly like a cigarette I haven't even used my mod in a few days
p133
aVPhix Dry Hitting??
p134
aVGET A JUUL OR A PHIX I swear to god my phix has saved my life.
p135
aVYea  just got the phix no more clouds
p136
aVugh i have the phix, its way worse than the juul, but my juul got stolen XD\u000a
p137
aVI'd *HIGHLY* recommend a phix or a juul for your father and maybe a vaporesso revenger for yourself.
p138
aVYe I'm talking about the juul and the phix specifically.\u000a\u000aThey are really similar to a cigarette and they both use 52mg with nicotine salts which means it's slot more like a cigarette throat hit/buzz and also they look really nice and are compact
p139
aVHave you ever heard of a Juul or a phix?
p140
aVsmallest they come is cartridge based devices like the JUUL and the Phix by MLV.\u000a\u000athat being said, there are plenty of small all-in-one vapes that are great for concealment.\u000a\u000athe Eleaf Icare, Smok Vape pen 22, wismec MY JET\u000a\u000athis totally depends on preference.\u000a\u000aJUUL and PHIX both use high concentrations of Nicotine Salts, which have twice as much of a nicotine hit, just alot smoother than free base.\u000a\u000aDo a little research and find which one is best for you.
p141
aVTry the phix by mlv hits a lot softer. Good pod flavors and a charger thats cool and works very well
p142
aVI suggest looking on YouTube and search for review shootouts. Search \u000aJUUL, my von erl, phix, Bo, cig-a-likes, Penguin, Aurora, iCare, Breeze. Others will also pop up as you watch. Personally, refillable ones I feel are the more economical option.
p143
aVThanks for the heads up. I was planning on ditching it anyways and getting a juul or Phix instead. 
p144
aVIt's gonna be kind of hard to say no starter kits since it's an all in one device.\u000a\u000a[The Smok Vape Pen 22](http://www.smoktech.com/kit/vape-pen-22) has a similar design, but a produces slightly more Vapor.\u000a\u000aIf you wanted to go even stealthier than that, I would recommend using nicotine salts in a [eleaf icare](http://www.eleafworld.com/icare/) or pod based devices like the [JUUL](https://www.juulvapor.com) and [Phix](http://www.majorleaguevapers.com/phix-starter-kit/).\u000a\u000aLet me know which one you like and I'll tell you about each and every one of them\u000a\u000a

aVMini mods have been making a huge impact on the market lately. Some of the hottest ones we know are Juul, Phix, and suorin air! What are some other mini mods that we need to look out for !? \U0001f32c
p146
aVThc infused juul/phix pods
p147
aVGet a phix or a juul. I've been using my phix for quite some time now and see no reason to smoke anymore. It uses 50nic (5%). Can't say the pods are the cheapest things in the world though.  
p148
aVMaybe the [Limitless Pulse](http://www.myvaporstore.com/Limitless-Mod-Co-Pulse-Pod-System-Starter-Kit-p/lim-pul10.htm), Or the [MLV Phix](http://www.myvaporstore.com/MLV-PHIX-Pod-System-Starter-Kit-p/mlv-phx10.htm)?

aVPhix not producing vapor, plz help!
p150
aVHey guys so I bought the Phix 4 days ago and it has been working fine until very recently. It charges fine and lights up when I inhale but doesn't make any vape. I tinkered around a bit and noticed that the one gold pin is lower than the other (picture is bad sorry). I think it may not be making a good connection with the pod. Anyone have any ideas or advice? 
p151
aVI don't have a phix but I do have a juul. What I did to fix it was clean it with a q tips and isopropyl alcohol. With the pin issue I'd probably try and press the pin down slightly and see if it moves. If it can try to move it until it is level with the other pin.
p152
aVHow long does a phix pod last?
p153
aVPhix by MLV
p154
aVi went ahead and googled phix for you and found your problem\u000a\u000a"There was some moisture on the inside of my PHIX pod pack. What should I do?"\u000aPHIX pods subject to excessive humidity or a drastic altitude change (like flying on a plane) may experience a minor amount of condensation or leakage. If your PHIX pod leaks, it's best to avoid direct contact with the liquid, but if you get liquid on your hands simply wash with soap and water. You may continue to use a PHIX pod if some liquid has escaped, but carefully wipe the juice off with a clean cloth or tissue before inserting into your device. If leaking persists, please contact the PHIX Care team.
p155
aVI would suggest getting a quick cigalike (juul, phix, cync, myjet, icare) with 25-50mg salt NIC juices.\u000a\u000aHits the cravings dead on when your really wanting to pick up a cancer stick
p156
aVQuestions about the phix
p157
aVNice! I'm thinking of getting a phix but the icare is super cheap! However the phix has way more nicotine so I'm on the fence 
p158
aVThe phix needs more flavors...
p159
aVMods from left to right; wimsec rx200, geek vape karma kit, phix. \u000aJuices; artic blast and green apple. From vapejoose.com\u000aDon't judge me for my phix it's for when I'm at work. We have a smoking room and I can't\u200b have clouds
p160
aVJuul or Phix?
p161
aVI didn't like any of the Phix flavors. While I do like three of the JUUL flavors.
p162
aVPhix.. because it's easier to find pods.
p163
aVI would say a phix or a juul but they both take pods\u000aTry the emili vape kit it is what I started with it works great there is an option to choose a button or non button 
p164
aVMy friend just bought a phix
p165
aVUse the phix or an I care mini with high nic there is some mr salty e liquid that delivers real high nic I have tried it on 45 mg and it hits your system quick and will adjust your cravings, with the I care , the phix is a pod system and I think it goes to 50 mg , I use big tanks and create huge amounts of vapour on high watts but for being discreet and getting the hit use one of the above 
p166
aVVape Mail ! Phix by MLV
p167
aVPhix by Mlv is closed loop system similar to juul but i heard really good things about it so i decided to test it out let me know if any of you guys are familiar with this device if so let me know what you think of it !
p168
aVThere's going to be a ton of devices that will be releasing soon so you shouldn't worry about it.  What's current on the market are:\u000aJuul\u000aMyjet\u000aVon Erl\u000aPhix\u000aBo\u000aFITT\u000aThese are your options, my preference would be Juul, Myjets &amp; Von Erl.  I find these pretty easy to use, and delivery for all is great!  Von Erl &amp; Myjet is cost friendly so you don't have to spend much.  More money you save on a device so you can spend it on the liquid!  Research them to see which would best fit you. Spend sometime researching on liquid tho, I would definitely look into something with Nicotine Salt because it goes best with these devices.
p169
aVPHIX! Thought the Pax Juul was good? This thing is ten times better.
p170
aVHometown hero makes 20mg (also infzn by Brewell mfg, the guys who make the phix. They make an 18mg) other than that you\u2019d have to look at companies like cloudberryvapors or elite elixirs, which the juice is made upon request.\u000aI feel the same though, U.S juice companies should make 20mg 
p171
aVI'll let you decide if any of these are fast/easy but search for "youtube refill mark ten elite podss" gives lots of results.\u000a\u000aSearch for "youtube refill phix pods" also gives lots of results.\u000a\u000aSome say the Phix and Elite are not the same even though they look identical. IDK, don't have either one, just couldn't let this post go unanswered.
p172
aVI do! I basically haven't touched any of my other vapes since getting the Alto. It has the smoothest, quietest, and most satisfying out of all the pod systems I've tried (Juul, Phix, Myle, plus various refillables). I use the mixed fruit pods which aren't the greatest tasting (Phix blue raspberry gets that accolade), but it's a fair trade off. Love my Alto. 
p173
aVI picked up a novo recently. I was a steady juul guy and I bought other pod devices in the past (breeze 2, phix) which I hated. The novo has been very solid in my replacement for the juul since it\u2019s so similar. I\u2019d recommend 
p174
aVMy sister uses a Phix and she loves it. she said the only good flavors are hard strawberry and blue raspberry. 
p175
aVKwit Stick is my favorite and I have tried many. Fair warning, the tobacco flavor is trash and always prime the pod after refill, if you don't then it burns the wick and ruins the pod, I'm currently getting 6+ refills per pod. Other than that the hits are strong and consistent, no leaks, FAST charging and its cheap to use. They give you 10% off your first order and frequently send you emails for 10% coupon codes if you buy from their site rather than a wholesaler. They screwed up my order once but sent the missing item same day with no questions asked. Highly recommended over Juul, Ziip, Phix, Fit, Inifinix, Drop, and myBlu.
