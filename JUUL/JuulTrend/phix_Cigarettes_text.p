VAround two weeks . I use 6mg nic on a box mod and its great. You can look into higher nic lower wattage devices like the Juul. They use  50mg salt nic and a low power. Devices like the Juul and Phix are most similar to actual cigs in terms of nicotine.

aVThe difference is the nic salts e juice. Much smoother so you can use high nicotine. Closed systems like the Juul and Phix include this. You can also put this juice in a refillable open pod system like the Aspire Breeze 2. \u000a\u000aThese also don't make a big cloud, so they can be stealthy. Unlike with a sub-ohm tank, no one has ever given me the stink eye for using a Juul.
p2
aVI find the Phix tobacco pods more realistic and satisfying than the Juul. The throat hit is intense.\u000a\u000aWhat all vapes lack is staying power. You have to keep vaping. Not like you smoke and then you are ok without it for awhile.\u000aMaybe because they don't have MAOI's.\u000a\u000a

aVBro honestly of your gonna be paranoid and worried 24/7 or everytime you smoke what is the point? No need to put yourself through he'll just to smoke. Try Juul or phix they have good flavors and have a good nicotine hit. At least it's better than smoking. \u000a\u000a*just as a side note I stopped smoking 28 days ago. I never really get addicted to anything Tbh. Like I even tried herion one time... Hated it and never looked back ( over 10 years ago). I feel great rn I can fully breathe and workout again like I used to. When I get the urge to smoke I just use my juul and then go on with my day

aVjust stop smoking cigs! I feel you, bro, I smoke too but if you are legitimately scared it could be for a good reason. I would honestly just recommend smoking a Juul, pax, Jax, Vuse, phix, or blu. or invest in a nice rechargeable mod. Go see a doctor tho because you could also have an anxiety issue that's undiagnosed. Pinpoint as to why you smoke this is a huge part of cigarette dependency! Are you smoking to escape something? Idk man you do you but figure out your situation 
p5
aVIf that all fails then honestly don't fuck with cigs its not all that its cracked up 2 be for some people. If you are just tryna do it for that nic then just buy some Nicorete it is much more effective and could be more cost effective aswell. If your really into the smoking aspect then just get a juul, phix, or sorain air.
