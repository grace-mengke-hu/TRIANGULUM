Vtips for flying\u000a\u000ai am going on a flight with my family and wanted to bring my juul vaporizer and backup cartridges. my question is if i just keep these in my carryon will i be stopped by tsa? my family knows i vape but do not want me using nicotine so i would rather not be stopped by security and have them pull these things out of my backpack. should i be able to get through security without any incident?

aVthe juul is a very small device this shouldnt raise any suspicion should it?\u000a

aVJUUL by PAX

aVI've got a JUUL for a CIG a like style. It's not circular, it's rectangular so it looks "odd" but it definitely does a decent job of replicating the cigarette style sensation better than the bigger devices. \u000a\u000aTheir tobacco flavor isn't half bad either (better than Vuze) and the vapor production is solid and on par with a real cigarette. \u000a\u000aThe best part is I picked up the JUUL while traveling so I could have something smaller than my mod and I'm still using it a month or two later. It's not my primary device buy I still use about 1/4 of a cartridge per day. 
p4
aVStart him out with the pax juul. I was a super heavy smoker and has attempted unsuccessfully to make the switch time and again. And tried pretty much all the different styles of devices. None did the trick until I came across the juul. It drags so much like a cigarette, there are no buttons to press, and it is ultra portable. I bought a couple of them so I could already keep one charged and alternate flavors through out the day while getting accustomed to inhaling vapor instead of smoke. Also the juice is something special it really kicks the shit out of the nicotine cravings and that is key to not getting too frustrated early on. I still use mine when I'm drinking and feeling week. Lol there is a good article on them below. Seriously can't recommend them enough. I never thought I could make the switch.\u000ahttp://www.wired.com/2015/04/pax-juul-ecig/

aVDifference between E-Cig (Juul) and a real vape machine?\u000a\u000aHi all,\u000aNew to the vaping game here. Bought a Juul e-cig about a month ago. Haven't smoked a cigarette since, and no cravings! Really enjoying it.\u000aThe Juul is nice for when I am going out, as it does not take up a bunch of room in my pocket, and is discreet. However I smoke mostly while I'm just at home, and the Juul refill packs are not cheap! When I was at the vape store getting some refills last, I asked the guy behind the counter what the difference between the Juul and "the real vape machines" - the devices I see a bunch of guys cleaning, modding, etc, at the vape store. He said that the Juul has 5% nicotine, is smaller for easy carrying, and produces less smoke, which is good for the public. He said the juices they carry for the other machines have 3% nicotine and produce more smoke.\u000aI buy the 4-packs of the Juul refills, they typically last me 5-6 days. They are about $16 each. \u000aWould there be any sense in investing in a real vape machine, using the juices? I am talking stricly cost wise, here.

aVYou can buy their juice and fill a juul pod with it after some tinkering. Just YouTube it.

aVSunflower Pipe's Juul by Pax Product Review\u000a\u000a[deleted]
p8
aVIt's the same stuff as a fog machine with nicotine added. Not just "water vapor" but also not very harmful at all. I was bitched at recently for using my vape at a concert that made heavy use of a fog machine recently. Things almost got heated, mainly because moron couldn't realize that the fog machine was pumping out more vapor than my little JUUL ever could. Morons.
p9
aVI have a ton of vape setups and they're great and got me off cigs but recently I needed something small and discreet to use at customer sites for work when I didn't want to blow clouds outside their buildings.  I picked up a Juul kit because I liked that it didn't look like a cigarette, wasn't owned by Big Tobacco and heard the flavors were decent.  It is by far the closest to a cigarette experience I've found, the nic hit is instant and powerful and the flavors are actually really good.  They're not cheap but I would highly recommend buying one to use for those times you feel like you really need a cig, I think it would be very effective for that.
p10
aVpax juul is tiny
p11
aVI have a Juul in my work bag for super stealth vape at customer sites when needed and it works well enough nic/flavor wise.  It's nice too being able to see how much liquid you have left but they're pricey.\u000a\u000aQuit for a couple weeks using Blu's, not a huge fan of the disposables but the higher priced ones got the job done for a bit but I was ready to give up when I decided to visit a vape shop instead of buy a pack of cigarettes.
p12
aVMy Juul E-Cig experience\u000a\u000aI recently got the Juul E-Cig from Pax by recent I mean I have had it so far for about one week and so far I am very satisfied more so than I though I would be. I smoke Marlboro reds and have been for about going on 16 years and when I stated it was Camel regulars (non filters). I have tried numerous e-cigs and the only one that worked before was a cigar mod because I didnt have to pull slowly and recently a mod my brother has but that was useless for me at least. \u000a\u000aI smoke about a pack or so a day if I am going to be honest with myself I am buying atleast 1 pack min every day. That all changes If I'm loaded or heavy gaming that one pack could easily turn into 2 or more. Also I work from home so its not like i have regulated cig breaks and my job requires a lot of critical thinking and writing. If there anyone is in a similar situation they know the easiest way to solve any issue is to take a cig break to help focus the mind which is bs and I do realize its just my habit and mind creating a false stressful situation but I don't think about that until I look at my fresh pack and its down to 8 and I'm not finished with my work but whatever the store is close. \u000a\u000aEnough about that I recently did some traveling and being around my family and getting ready for the 4th I couldn't light up like I normally do to much running around. i kind of anticipated this so I got some nic gum for the times I was around the family member who doesn't smoke either at their house or in their car. When I ordered this product I had some issues with the site but all of that was resolved asap the customer service rep Jamal he took care of everything same day and stayed in contact with me until the product came with me to make sure everything went well. \u000a\u000aNow when I got the product I haven't smoked in 1 1/2 days but felt like a week I immediately charged the unit and put in the tabacc in there because I don't smoke menthol's or hookah's my first hit gave me that first cig rush complete with the light headed feeling and killed my craving. Last night I did smoke a cig later that night but not because I needed to but simply because I wanted to and it really didnt do anything for me. On the 4th after drinking beer, jack and eating alot of bbq I was vaping all day so when I did smoke a cig I did it because I wanted to and it had the same effect. \u000a\u000aI have since ran out of the Tabacc and have been using the other flavors I really dont like them that much for the reason that I said I dont smoke menthol's or hookah's but that may be different for each person. I did order more the tabacc took about 3 days to run out and that was heavy vaping and my cravings are way down so I expect the pods to last longer. \u000a\u000aCheck it out for yourself or ask me any questions.

aVJuul Review from a Light Smoker\u000a\u000aI recently purchase a Juul and I am loving the device and the vaping experience so far but I have a few concerns.\u000a\u000aFirst I would like to give some background on me and my habits. I am in my early-mid 20's, I am active (cycling 20~ mile twice a week, lift weights 3-4 time a week). I am also a light smoker, a pack of analog cigs usually last me 1-2 months while sharing with friends. I am by no means into custom mods, I have tried them before and I love to use them socially but the bulk and inconvenience really put me off on starting this hobby.\u000a\u000aLets get to the review.\u000a\u000aThe juul is exceptionally well designed, which is very important to me because I enjoy the physical aspect of smoking and its very convenient to carry with me. The lack of bulk and easy to use has allowed me to incorporate it into my everyday life, something that I could never do with analogs.\u000a\u000aFlavors are really good. So far I have tried fruit, crème brulee, and mint. Mint is my favorite, fruit is surprisingly good, and crème brulee can get a little overwhelming but it works very well for desert. I haven't tried tobacco yet, but it smell great and I doubt I won't like it.\u000a\u000aSome of the advantages of Juul are not unique to this specific ecig. The best qualities it has are shared with just about every other vape in the market, it doesn't leave a smell in my breath/car/clothes, and it doesn't seem to affect my health right away (lung capacity seems unchanged).\u000a\u000aIt is the best cigga-like that I've tried as far as flavor and sensation goes. I am not an expert, and I have only tried lowed, gas station provided, cigalike, however the initial nicotine rush is nearly identical to an analog and the throat sensation is satisfying without being overwhelming. I must say that I would trade off the throat satisfaction for a benzoic acid-free product. The product is nowhere near perfect though, battery life, leakage, and inconsistence are the main annoyances.\u000a\u000aBattery life is good but it does not live up the manufacturer's claim. A full charge usually lasts to about 1/2 to 2/3's of the contents of a juulpod. I am not saying that the battery life is bad, because its better than what I would expect from a product as light and small as this, but it leads to significant performance decrease as you approach the end of life.\u000a\u000aNot only does the battery affect the consistence of the product, but you have to drag a lot more when you reach about 1/4 of the pod's capacity. You have to drag for significantly longer, and sometimes no vapor comes off despite still having plenty of juice left.\u000a\u000aLastly there is a significant amount of juice leakage when you first open a new pod. I've been through three pods in the past two weeks and every time I got a small amount of juice on my lips with a full pod.\u000a\u000aOverall I must say that the draw backs are not deal breakers and that I am very happy with the product. My nicotine consumption has gone through the roof, but this entirely my fault.\u000a\u000aI think this product appeals mostly to people like me who are looking for a small, satisfying, and well-designed product. You will not puff clouds with it, but the product is stylish and has a strong kick to it. It will never replace a mod kit, but it offers the a compelling set of compromises for its category.
p14
aVNew "e-Cig" called Juul...sounds a little interesting. Thoughts?
p15
aVThe Juul is what you'd get if VUSE and TARS of Intersteller mated and had a love child.
p16
aVYa I really, really want a Pax based on what everyone has said. I just still can't justify the price for the device. Maybe for my birthday or something. If this Juul is as good they may have a killer product.
p17
aV"You do look a little like you plugged a USB stick into your mouth when you use it, but it\u2019s undeniably cooler than that insipid mess of tubes and glowsticks you\u2019re probably using now." \u000a\u000a"... there\u2019s something wonderfully satisfying about dropping it into the magnetic charger. (Magnets!) If you wave the Juul around, it lights up in a rainbow of colors."\u000a\u000aSorta the same thing, ain't it?
p18
aVHave you considered picking up a pen type vape and a high nicotine juice for when those cravings become unbearable? Maybe an iCare? A Juul? 
p19
aVGet a JUUL
p20
aVI would recommend the juul. Very low maintenance, easy to use, and has the perfect amount of nicotine for someone looking to quit smoking.
p21
aVRipTrippers recommends the juul ecig for newcomers to vaping from smoking. I'd recommend looking into that. It might be a little more expensive over long term but it's simple and a good way to get exposed to vaping.\u000a\u000aYouTube "riptrippers juul" to watch an overview.
p22
aVGet him a Juul. I have 3 co-workers that haven't smoked in over a year because of this cig-a-like. It may not look like much but I know it does the job. Good luck
p23
aVJuul with tobacco flavor is the closest to a cigarette I have tried, by far. Plus no refilling even? Costs a bit but much cheaper than all those cigarettes I bet, even if not it can allow him to get off of them and maybe switch to a cheaper vaping alternative
p24
aVI'd recommend the Myjet over the juul. It's the same device but you have the option of filling your own cartridges instead of worrying about buying pre fill cartridges. 
p25
aVOr an eleaf icare. Unless there is somewhere that keeps juul carts in stock he will go right back to smoking. The myjet and icare are great low cost all in ones that don't rely on refilled cartridges.
p26
aVIf you want coil heads - nautilus mini. If you don't mind building - Kayfun Mini V1/2/3.\u000a\u000a\u000a**EDIT:** Or a Juul. Those are great to quit smoking (or so I hear) and probably resemble a cigarette more than a bigger(ish), more cumbersome(ish) setup like those I mentioned above.
p27
aVFormer Juul-er looking to switch\u000a\u000aSup gang, title says it all. I've been smoking the Juul for about 3-4 months now but have been trying to quit because the nicotine content is absurdly high and is fucking with me. I've been putting different e-juices in empty juul pods, but it doesn't rip nearly as well as a good mod I'd assume. What mod would you recommend for someone wanting to quit the Juul? I'd prefer something a bit smaller that could easily be carried around by pocket. Money isn't really an issue, but something cheaper would be cool. Thanks, sorry I'm a bit of a noob here. 
p28
aVI recommend getting a capable mod instead of a "starter".  Starters tend to have low wattage and non-replaceable batteries with low capacity.  Even if you don't use all the capabilities today, you might eventually.\u000a\u000aYou are immensely spoiled by the size of the Juul.  I can't think of another device that comes close to its size.  Are you looking for a cigalike shape like the ego/evod or are you willing to try a box mod?
p29
aVDefinitely willing to try a box mod. And yeah I totally get that there is nothing that even remotely rivals the size of the Juul. That's fine, I can live with something bigger for sure. Any pointers on a decent box mod?
p30
aVNot to detract all all from /u/TheBlackDred below - he has great suggestions that have definite benefits in the size department with the way the tanks are subsumed into the form factor of the mod.\u000a\u000aMy favorite is the Smok Alien.  It's a dual-cell 18650 mod, has really nice firmware, and gives you the flexibility to explore whichever style of vaping interests you since it has variable wattage and temperature control modes with a maximum 250W.  These features describe a lot of mods in its price range, but I'm very impressed with the build quality of the Alien.  I really like that the Alien has a bar to press to turn on the coil instead of a button.  It feels very comfortable.  It also has an OLED screen with all the pertinent information on it simultaneously.  I really like that.\u000a\u000aThe Alien with a tank and two batteries weighs about the same as 500 Juuls. J/K.  You're spoiled there, too.  My combo weighs about 282g.  Juul weighs 15g. :)\u000a\u000aMy strongest advice, far above any brand or model, is to make sure you aren't wasting money on a purchase that you might outgrow too quickly.
p31
aVIcare or Icare mini are nice if you want something similar to juul
p32
aVJuul.
p33
aVI know the thing is great but floods immediately. I just want something that doesnt suck to get my GF off of cigarettes but all the cheap shit is adding up... kanger subvod, leaks like a bastard. Ego aio box, burnt hits immediately. iCare mini, might as well stick a straw in the bottle and call it a day. Oh except that wouldn't burn your mouth and lips, so that would actually be better. \u000a\u000aThere is the juul but pods get expensive quick, and weve already wasted 30, plus 30, plus 30 dollars (plus money for coils and juice each time...) on shit that sucks ass yet gets fine reviews. Then you actually read up and everyone that gets one has the same issue. Damn shill reviewers... and random "lucky" people that somehow have never had a kanger product leak or a teeny tiny coil fail to wick max VG juice... do you just live in burnthitsville and not notice? Or is quality control just so bad that all of these devices are in fact perfect, when you happen to get one out of ten that meets all the tolerances?
p34
aVI've had some luck refilling an older family member's juul pods - youtube has several walkthroughs.
p35
aVA few questions for discussion!\u000a\u000a**1) What are your thoughts on Juuls**\u000a\u000a**2) How much have you ever spent on a mod/upgrades**\u000a\u000a**3) Can we see a picture of your prized possession** (amazing or cheap it's all sentimental baby!)\u000a\u000a**4) Favorite Juice/Brand** (Even type of flavor, such as minty, fruity, tarty, etc.)\u000a\u000a
p36
aV1. Love them. Have two. \u000a2. My most expensive mod is probably $60 or so. Nothing crazy. \u000a3. https://i.imgur.com/sIONPdD.jpg\u000a4. Amalfi, Bigglesworth Labs. 12mg, 50/50. It\u2019s the best. \u000a\u000a****\u000aEDIT: I think I misunderstood #2. So far this year I\u2019ve spent $1,500 or so. That\u2019s including all the mods, several dozen flavor concentrates, a scale, coil jigs, wire, cotton, batteries, charger, coils, magnetic mixer, more mods, JUUL pods, atomizer stand, PG, VG, more VG, syringes, pipettes, flasks, beakers, funnels, RDAs, RTAs, subohm tanks, a shelf to hold this shit, battery cases, little straps to keep the wire spools from unspooling\u2026 oh, and juice. You get the idea. 
p37
aV1: the juul is alright, but there are better basic devices out there at this point. The icare and the myjet are better in my opinion. \u000a\u000a2: I have no idea how much I've spent on mods/upgrades and I don't really wanna know as I've got a decent collection of some mid range ($100-150) to high end ($150+) mods and I really don't want to calculate what I've spent haha. \u000a\u000a3: not sure I have any pics but my prized possession in vaping is my provari P3 and my kayfun v4. It just works and it's my go to set up. Edit: just took a pic of it [here](https://imgur.com/a/S37Is) \u000a\u000a4: favorite juice? Probably gambit by five pawns or indigoRY4. 
p38
aV"A shelf to hold all this shit" ahahaha.\u000a\u000aIf you don't mind me asking, why do you have two Juuls?
p39
aVStandard \u201cTwo is one and one is none\u201d philosophy. \u000a\u000aI initially had just the one. I went on a camping trip and forgot to bring my charger along. It died on me and I had to make do with a Vuse for the rest of the weekend. It sucked. As soon as I got back home, I was going to get another charger ($10), then realized that for $40 more, I could get a backup Juul and another four pods. So that\u2019s what I did. 
p40
aV1) I like them for stealth vaping, but if I wanted something like a juul I'd get an eleaf iCare.\u000a\u000a2) ummm probably 2-3k in the last 6 months.\u000a\u000a3)I'm still trying to get my hands on a tiffany blue tugboat box mod....\u000a\u000a4) RKOI by coilspill. It's a strawberry champagne flavor or recently I've really been digging lava flow by naked
p41
aVI'd say go for a juul
p42
aV+1 for Juul. 
p43
aVjuul
p44
aVIf lightness and portability are your preference, I'd say nothing comes close to the Juul. The thing is so small it can fit in your wallet. The pull is very akin to a cigarette and you'll get your nic fix in a couple of hits. I'm pretty sure it's around $50 for a starter kit that comes with the device, charger, and 4 pods. 
p45
aVI\u2019ve successfully snuck in my JUUL a couple of times. Just jammed it in my shoe. I can\u2019t remember if I walked through a metal detector or not, though. \u000a\u000a/u/Onitsuj\u2019s solution is way more foolproof. You\u2019re already putting your keys in the bowl when you walk through the detector, so it won\u2019t trigger that. 
p46
aVQuestion\u000a\u000aIf I had a 30ml bottle of Juul vape juice, (I'm not sure of what is in the pods) how many mg of nicotine would be in the bottle?
p47
aVDIY Juul Charger??! LOL
p48
aVr/juul loves this kind of stuff
p49
aVWhat's up guys, new here! Still trying to familiarize myself with Reddit.\u000a\u000aFinally made the switch from a box mod/tank set up to a closed system device.\u000a\u000aAnd holy shit... The JUUL is fucking great! I've been vaping since 2013 and this device is pretty damn awesome. My biggest gripe would be expensive pods. Although, I do enjoy the nicotine delivery. Gets me pretty light headed and gets me to vape less... for now. Any other Juul users in here and do you guys have any alternatives to refilling? 
p50
aVI don't use my juul any more but I must say it is super satisfying to hit. It is possible to refill the pods if you find they are getting to expensive
p51
aVHow come you don't use it anymore? I started messing with it and tried refilling it with some old 18mg that i had laying around. Definitely not as satisfying as the JUUL pods but i've been hearing some good things about Mr. Salt-E on the facebook groups. Gonna give that try when it comes in. 
p52
aVhey man I'm realy thinking about getting a Icare mini. Can you compare this to the juul in any way. how it hits and such
p53
aVI have not tried the Juul. I know it's fairly popular tho. \u000a\u000aAll I can tell you about is the icare mini. The Mini has a pretty tight air flow, like sucking a milkshake through a straw. You need to use higher nic unless you're going to take a lot of hits because you aren't getting as much vapor per hit. Flavor is fine, not amazing but it's good. Not much cloud obviously but you'd be surprised. \u000a\u000aCoils last a decent amount of time and the base recharges it fast, you can use it with the base attached as well or direct charge to the actual mod. \u000a\u000aThey're cheap so maybe pick both up.
p54
aVJust talked to guy who has a Juul. Says they are way better than the Mini. \u000a\u000aSays it has 50 nic but almost no hit, and after about three hits he's done. \u000a \u000aUses cartridges and is rechargeable.
p55
aVThis. Or all in one/pod systems like the iCare, Juul, or MyJet. Any simple system that are like cigarettes. For the MyJet or iCare, just make sure you get him some 18mg, especially if he was a consistent smoker.\u000aEdit: The Juul also has a really nice menthol flavor, and with that he wouldn't even have to buy juice, they just come in pod packs that he snaps in when one runs dry.\u000aEdit 2: [I have a post from earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/5ewry0/looking_for_a_setup_for_my_mom/?st=IVZH392W&amp;sh=f242cc31), and it was about an individual looking for a setup for his mom, you can see what others are recommending.\u000a
p56
aVJuul also has a really good throat hit and is very close to cigs i feel.
p57
aVThank you I'll check the Juul out!
p58
aVI would say check out the eleaf icare or the juul
p59
aVi would suggest a device like the Juul, or try getting a MTL atomizer and run lower wattage/higher nic to get that feeling. 
p60
aVI split my time among four devices:\u000a\u000a* __eGo AIO:__ 27ish watts on a 0.6\u03a9 coil\u000a* __eVic VTC Mini:__ 60\u201375 watts on a Crown 0.25\u03a9 or Griffin 0.55\u03a9 build\u000a* __Noisy Cricket:__ 110 watts on a 0.56\u03a9 build\u000a* __Pax JUUL:__ Huh? How the hell do I know?\u000a
p61
aVJust wait once you get a juul pen they hit at 54mg now that's fun. 
p62
aVEleaf Icare \u000aA nice step up from the juul
p63
aVVery nice. Does the iCare have a button? Or is it like a Juul? 
p64
aVIt's like the juul. Just draw and it'll hit. I just really like the fact that you can use any juice with it. 
p65
aVGreat choice, also the myjet is a lot like the juul but better.
p66
aVIt's not bad. The flavors not as good as the juul but you still get a pretty good taste out of it. 
p67
aVCheck out the juul, you can get it from most gas station where I'm from which is US
p68
aVTry picking up a juul or just a high nic tight mouth to lung set up. Thats what i do. Still don't do it in bars and the like but it helps alot when you can take a few puffs at 15mg or so and be good without blowing out a couple mls in an rda
p69
aVI'm totally into the mini vape trend.  I just got a myjet and a JUUL for my recent trip to Florida and was pretty happy.  I would like to try one of these icares out too.\u000a\u000aI really wanna get some mr saltz nicotine salts juice for the myjet
p70
aVI'm torn between this and the juul :/ 
p71
aVI've tried both, I reccomend this over the JUUL but honestly both are very similar. I believe the battery on this is slightly larger too.
p72
aVget an icare or a juul those are the closest things to cigarets and most importantly hassle free... \u000a\u000aa smoker set in his way who is not really interested in vaping won´t like having to maintain his vape gear and educate himself on the subject, if he gets into it by using the icare, than a upgrade later on is much more viable.\u000a\u000a\u000aalso why can´t the eleafe icare or the juul be used non stop in your opinion? \u000a\u000ahe won´t chainvape it... he is a smoker and he will use it like a cigarette... thats not chainvaping... and being a cigarette substitute is excatly what those were designed for.\u000a\u000aa pack a day is not so much that those devices couldn´t handle it...\u000a\u000aif you can afford to get a juul and buying the pods, which is a little bit \u000amore expensive than buing juice for the eleaf icare, go for the juul their juice uses nicotine salts and the effect is closer to a cigarette than other devices. It should still be cheaper than a pack a day.\u000a\u000a\u000aEdit: to be more specific on the pricing, one juul pod equals around one pack of cigarets and costs 4$ from the manufacturer... you can probably get them cheaper somewhere else online...
p73
aVGreat idea, would recommend!\u000a\u000a\u000aEspecially with you yourself not vaping going with the smok tfv8 you can easily get new coils and are good to go.\u000a\u000a\u000aFor two total novices I would advise against an rta like the petri which was suggested above...\u000a\u000aBTW. If this is supposed to be an incentive to Stopp smoking, be aware that could also backfire the setups suggested here are great imho if someone is interested in vaping already. If not, I personally would her rather give a Juul or a eleafe icare and a nice other gift, which are both way more hassle free and cater more to a smoker wanting to quit imho.

aVPax juul for efficient vaping?\u000a\u000aI've had some more substantial cloud-makers before but generally stopped because I can't use vapes that produce tons of smoke where I live and I was burning through more ejuice than I could justify even though I loved the nicotine delivery and smoke production. \u000a\u000aNow I'm mainly looking for something focused on nicotine delivery and cost efficiency--how does the PAX Juul stack up? Thanks for any info.
p75
aVPods are relatively expensive, but they're easy to refill if you DIY or find a vendor who sells eliquid that's compatible (relatively thin, high nic). Most Pod refill eliquids won't use Nicotine Salts but I'm not entirely sold on that being what's so special about JuuL nic anyways. [There's a decent theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deeper_DIY/comments/3k6h2r/nicotine_freebase_vs_salt_absorption_vaporization/) that its the benzoic acid that makes Juul nic so special. \u000a\u000aI use a Juul myself on the occasion when a full APV kit isn't desirable (wearing a suit, formal occasions, hiking, quick errand trip, etc). I've found I get about a day's use out of a full battery and 1-2 days per pod, mostly with 30mg/ml refill eliquid. 
p76
aVJuul
p77
aVI love gooold. Anyways, the Juul uses nicotine salts from which I read it allows more nicotine absorption. The pods are really easy to refill. A simple YouTube search should explain it. But the cool thing is I found a liquid company that makes their juice with nicotine salts. [MrSaltE](https://gaslightvapor.com/collections/e-liquids/mr-salt-e-liquids) 
p78
aVThe Myjet is also a great little device. Similar to the juul but with refillable "pods"  with built in coils. Definitely check it out. 
p79
aVYou could look into the juul ecig. I have a buddy who loves his. I believe most ampms have them, and there's a review on YouTube by Riptrippers that breaks down what it is and how it works. It's one of his most recent videos too\u000a\u000aEdit: FYI, the juul is a super slim little device that activates automatically when you take a pull, so no button pressing, and the draw/airflow is supposed to be very close to that of a cig. It comes with a variety of flavors including a tobacco flavor, and it's very plug and play style, as all of the juice is contained in a little cartridge that you just insert into the device. Nicotine level is much stronger than any other ecig I've heard of too. 
p80
aVWell if you're not too picky on flavour and just need something to kick the habit you can try the Juul. It's VERY compact, chargers via usb and has 4 different liquid pods containing like 5% of nicotine. \u000a\u000aDoesn't get simpler than inhaling when you want nicotine. Just remember to charge and change the liquid pods when empty.
p81
aVEven a cheap vape not from the gas station (istick pico comes to mind) will be far better quality, perform better, last longer and give you an overall better experience. \u000a\u000aI've known a few people who use the vuse, juul, or other disposables and go back to smoking because they are unreliable and not cheap in the long run.\u000a\u000aAll my opinion but a cheap tank and mod (istick Pico, joytech aio, etc..) will give you a better chance at quiting or be less off putting to a future hobbyist. 
p82
aVJuul is alright for a temporary replacement, say you're outta juice or cracked your tank or just waiting for a new mod. Just need that quick hit or something. 
p83
aVGet a juul
p84
aVFor those people recommend the juul, I tried to quit multiple times with blu and it never worked... the second I picked up a Juul (Jan 23, 2016) I was stinky free, and haven't had one since!  Even though I have a pico w/ a baby beast now, the juul still goes with me everywhere.
p85
aVHere's how I kicked the habit; I bought the Juul, I put it on the charger when I had 2 stinkys left in my pack, I smoked the stinkys, and threw the pack away while the Juul charged, I switched to the juul and never picked up another cig!  I then graduated to legit vaping with an istick pico and a tfv8 baby beast, but I still hit that Juul though because it's the closest feeling to smoking a cig that I've found.  Good luck!
p86
aVAlso 2 [JUUL](https://www.juulvapor.com) ecigs 
p87
aVDepends in what you have the airflow set at. I use 12mg in this bad boy as a way of saving money. I think it's a better deal than the juul  because you don't have to buy the pods, and it comes with a pretty sweet extended battery thing. I wanna get some 12mg menthol juice and this thing will be off the hook. It's actually like enough to hold with your lips. 
p88
aVThe juul by ploom. 
p89
aVJuul
p90
aVGuess it's not a popular opinion but I'd check out the Juul, if I was quitting now that's what I'd go with. Small, low maintenance, fairly available replacement pods, high nicotine, etc.
p91
aVI quit over a year ago and I want a juul real bad. It's just kind of pricey.
p92
aVThe reason I ask OP is because if you could manage, wire is pretty inexpensive, you could get 50ft of 22g kanthal from lightning vapes for something like 8$ or less. And organic cotton balls at a store that would last you months for like 5$. Honestly I would look into the gas station cig alikes. A juul or a vuse 
p93
aVThese are called the JUUL and are made by a company called Ploom(you might know their juices). You replace the cartridges on top to refill then rather than buying juice in a bottle. They're activated when you pull air through. 
p94
aVReally satisfying throat hit gets me buzzed in 2 pulls, 59mg tends to do that its good for out in public.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBut the wismec myjet is like an open tank system juul
p95
aVJust a small correction,\u000aJuul is owned by Pax Labs. They used to be called Ploom but some of the products were bought by a Japanese tobacco company and they created a new company.\u000aPloom currently has ties to big tobacco while Pax Labs are the kings of herbal vaporizers (and now closed system e cigs imo)
p96
aVLook into an ego AIO, endura t18/t22, or even a device like a juul or cync.  The first two are dead simple devices that have been on the market awhile and don't need anything other than a charge.  The juul and cync are closed systems that you can pick up until your symptoms subside, and due to their higher nicotine content, they may even work faster.  \u000a\u000aThe other route you could go is CBD oil, but that's not for everyone.
p97
aVI personally would not suggest those. They don't have nic or throat hit. There's a new little gadget that came out recently called juul. You should check that out.
p98
aVDon't use a Juul...   it's big tobacco trying to get into the vape business..  and junk...   A lot of newer vapers make the mistake of jumping into sub ohm setups out the gate for those big clouds and flavor.  if it is making you cough, why not try a smaller tank.  like the old school aspire nautilus.. at low wattage it's output is less, but alot better for new vapers.  also what nic juice are you using? 
p99
aVMy little project, a brushed steel Juul
p100
aVIf you take the battery out and torch the juul it will turn into a rose gold color
p101
aVHaving it gold plated would be awesome. But yeah I haven't actually torched my juul but a few people I know have. One didn't take his battery out and it didn't end well
p102
aVYeah thanks, I have a lavabox with a phenotype RDA and used to hate vapes like the Juul, but once I tried it I had to get one. They're just so easy to carry with you everywhere.
p103
aVIt's definitely more of a cig than a vape, that's why I stick to my Lavabox for clouds and flavor and the Juul for nic
p104
aVHow's the airflow on the juul? I'm was thinking about picking one up for my Gma, but she needs something that's mtl.
p105
aVMaybe look into something like the JUUl, i've heard thats amazing for people who just wanna get that buzz and tight draw feel
p106
aVLook into the Juul
p107
aVThe juul is great and discreet, as well as the Von Erl. If you're looking for a more complex vape I second the Joytech AIO or D22 if you want more battery power. 
p108
aVGet a Juul, it's crazy small, and you can use it as a backup when your batteries fail... Or just buy more batteries.  But the juul works great, closest thing to smoking a cig that I've ever found.
p109
aVThe juul isn't really a "setup" it's more like an add-along, or a side dish, that little something extra for times when you can't be "loud"
p110
aVI enjoy a hot vape. Try going up to 6mg and maybe it won't kill the flavor too much. I've also been interested in the juul for more of a nicotine quick fix. It has the same amount of Nic as a pack of cigs per pod.  Might be something worth trying! 
p111
aVAn older gentleman might be inclined to enjoy the favors of a Juul, to start.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.juulvapor.com/\u000a\u000aLater, he may want to delve deeper into the Vape World.\u000a\u000a

aVGlad my boyfriend doesn't mind vaping, he'd rather me vape than smoke. \u000a\u000aBut seriously if she's acting like a child when you talk about it then you really need to have a serious talk about it, if you can. That's being too controlling over a dumb situation that doesn't affect her that much. \u000a\u000aYou could try not vaping around her so it doesn't cause tension or maybe get a JUUL or something similar to get your nic fix, but you won't be blowing clouds and stuff. 
p114
aVI'd say the AIO or even a juul, if you want a pen mod, i think the subbox mini is the same as the nano, and the nano is the lightest mod i own, there is smaller mods, like the eLeaf Pico, but not necessarily lighter.
p115
aVquestions on the juuls\u000a\u000aSo I just purchased a juul and am an avid vaper. I work in a local b&m and have been using the tugboat v2 and also the rx200 with several different atomizer and attachments. When I vaped the juul I was impressed because I'm a 3mg nic user and that thing gives me a kick (50mg of nic) but so much different then a logic or blu ecig. \u000a  Anybody notice their nic tolerance go up I'm concerned of that happening and don't want it too. \u000a
p116
aVI'm about a 3mg user with my rda's, 6mg in tanks.  Purchased the JUUL for stealth vaping on the go.  Found that in moderation the JUUL is a good supplement, just don't hit it too often.  At my local B&amp;M the employees puff on their JUUL's constantly...I could see that increasing the nic requirement quite a bit.  As long as I stay off the analogs, I don't sweat it too much.
p117
aVThanks for the advice bro. I did that today at work I was hitting the juul when talking to customers but it still can't replace my smok tfv8 tank 
p118
aVIs Juul Worth it's Price?\u000a\u000aLet me start by saying I'm not an expert when it come to vaping. Although, I can say that i am very knowledgable from the 3 years of experience i gained from working in two different vape shops. I also have attended 3 different trade shows for work and just shopping. Anyways, enough about me lets talk about this device. I pick up my juul at the gas station down the street from my house (fancy i know). I didn't buy the juul because i thought it looked cool that would be ridiculous (explains 90% of my other mods). i bought the juul for the simple fact of convenience. It everything i needed its small, compact and packs and punch. However, the price brought a little tear to my eye watching my bank account getting anal rapped slowly. I'm not new to overly priced devices for example my sx mini and DNA 200. But The price seemed a little high at the time for such a small simple device. The juul is just that small and simple, no more overly complicated devices where you have to button smash the shit out of your mod just to turn the damn thing on. Plus the nicotine high you get of the first couple hits had me convinced its amazing how powerful this little thing is. But see we run in to another problem, how can you possibly charge that amount of money for something and only have 4 flavors. Extremely disappointing to say the least and a little side note the flavors are not the greatest so don't expect much. Don't get me wrong they are not the worst thing i have ever vaped because if you are true taste tester you have tried some nasty shit. The flavors a vapable for a lack of better words. \u000aTo sum everything up, Should you buy a juul? To answer this, you have to answer one simple questions. Are you buying this to quit smoking? Or? a you buying this because you love vaping? If you you pick the first one than yes this is the perfect device for you it is going to give you everything you need to succeed in you new healthier life style (good for you). If you picked the second one than hell no!! if you love Blowing fat clouds and doing tricks than this is not the device for you. Go to you local vape shop and ask them whats the right vape for you. PS Go to a real vape shop NOT a smoke shop there is a difference!! If you need more questions answered feel free to comment.                    Thank you for you time if you actually read this  \u000a   
p119
aVHoly wall of text :) (But I took the time)\u000a\u000aAnd I largely agree with every thing you wrote. I have two Juuls now, after having a "two is one and one is none" experience with it recently. I also have a dozen other mods, from a fleet of eGo AIOs to a few Noisy Crickets, Cool Fire TC100, VTC Mini, etc. RDAs and tanks and 1+\u03a9 mods.\u000a\u000aMy most-used devices are the AIOs for flavor and every day vaping, and the Juuls for when I'm having a beer or at a party. I'm only eight months from my smoking days, but drinking and socializing are still the events that make me miss smoking. And that's where the Juul really shines. Much more direct linkage between taking a hit and feeling the effects. Kills the cigarette craving cold.\u000a\u000aThe Bruule flavor is the only one I really like. Mint is ok. Tobacco and Fruit kinda suck in my opinion.\u000a\u000aCompared to the Vuse, Blu, etc, I think the Juuls are actually cheaper in the long run. The pods are about the same price, but I think they last longer than the cartridges for those other shitty cigalikes
p120
aVYes. I use the Juul out out of convenience. No huge rectangular bulge in my pocket anymore. I like the Vape. \u000a\u000aIf you check my post just history, I have compared it to the MyJet and Cync. I still use Juul on a daily basis. 
p121
aVAre there any similar products to the JUUL?
p122
aVGet a juul and you won't some another cigg. It is the best cig alike I ever tried. I'm 7 months without a cigg after 15 years of smoking. I have a lot of mods and tanks and don't even use them anymore. The juul is just like smoking a butt. 
p123
aV&gt; juul\u000a\u000aI've had at least 3 cigarette type vapes. None of them stuck. Very little options as far as flavor goes and the vapor production was always lackluster
p124
aVJuuls are actually very good. They hit nice and hard and the flavors are good for the most part
p125
aVSaw this on [Vaperazzi](https://www.instagram.com/p/BIq66iGBhsR/), apparently is just like juul but you can fill it with your own liquids.
p126
aVI vapes for 4 months and I got sick of it. I have tons of vape gear and juice and I stopped using it because it was like inhaling hot sugar and nothing else. I switched to the juul and havent picked up a vape since. The nic is satisfying and it is just like a cigg. 
p127
aVTrust me this thing is horrible the only good cigalike I've every used is the juul. 
p128
aVAgreed. I still use my juul, mostly for stealth. I just can't figure out why these big tobacco companies can't make a good vape device with all their money.
p129
aVI have my big mods that I use but I still keep a juul. It's nice for when I'm out in public and don't wanna be blowing huge clouds. Most of the juul flavors are pretty good too
p130

p131
aVI actually have a cubis tank for myself, and i got to be honest, im not really enjoying it so far and thinking of returning it, maybe i just got a bad one.\u000a\u000aJust checked out the VTC, theres a new one that can swap between 1/2 \u000ahttp://www.joyetech.com/category/evic-vtc/\u000aI might show her that and see what she thinks, \u000a\u000aThe mini vault and nugget look good, but will need her opinion, it might be too small length wise, but honestly i dont know, she can be pretty fussy lol\u000a\u000aregarding the von erl, that looks ideal , but i also showed her the juul as someone else suggested, and she wasn't keen on the idea of not being able to use her current ejuice ( which to be honest, is pretty annoying to myself &amp; my brothers as its the most basic menthol you could imagine... ) \u000a\u000aty for taking the time to provide me with a range of suggestions, im over hers today for dinner so ill try throw them all by her :)
p132
aVMaybe let her try yours and see what she thinks about that style.\u000a\u000aSometimes those quitting don't want big clouds, and want the restrictiveness of a cigarette. Other options would be a joyetech auto or an endurance t18.\u000a\u000aThe wismec myjet also just came out. Kind of like a juul with refillable pods. There are tons if good starter kits to quit smoking without jumping head first into the rabbit hole 
p133
aVWas it a [JUUL](https://www.juulvapor.com/), maybe?
p134
aV/u/stomper38's got you covered on the how-to-buy part. I just want to take a moment and shill for this device. It blows Blu and Vuse completely out of the water. \u000a\u000aI took mine on a camping trip and forgot to bring the charger. Learned the 2-is-1 and 1-is-none lesson again. Now I have two Juuls (and two chargers). \u000a\u000aIf you have the option to buy it at a gas station, do that over buying it online. It should be the same price and you don't have to be at home to sign for the package. 
p135
aVYeah. That's why I don't understand the comment. I guess OP thought Blu would be trying to use proprietary ingredients that the rest of the industry doesn't use?\u000a\u000aJUUL's e-liquid is something else, though. I have yet to find a comparable juice that is as satisfying at such low power. 
p136
aVIs this the new cig a like that is competing with the Juul? 
p137
aVAll hail the mighty juul!
p138
aVYes. I have the Juul as well. I like the Juul but I can never find pods in my area.  
p139
aVYeah, I've tried the Juul and I did like it, though people are always looking for those pods. 
p140
aVThere's a place off of Jones in Cypress that carry Juul pods, next door to a scrapbook store. Sorry, don't remember the name.
p141
aVNeed help with a stealth setup\u000a\u000aI'm going on vacation in a couple of weeks, and I'll be in a lot of public places. I'm thinking that chucking massive clouds with my RX200S/TFV8 combo, or my Sig213/TFV8 combo, would probably not be prudent. What's a good, stealthy setup I could use? Even a good pen mod, just to have while I'm near a lot of people. Any suggestions? I'm leaning toward a Juul, anybody have one of those? Pros/cons? Thanks!! :)
p142
aVI'd go with the AIO cheap and effective. The Juul you cant use your own juice.\u000aEdit - Fucking AUTO CORRECT
p143
aVMods: Grip taped Dimitri, H-priv 220 TV, RX200, Lotus mafia, and Juul\u000a\u000aAttys: MutationX V3, Moonshot, Freakshow, and Royal Hunter, respectively
p144
aVThe Pax Juul might fit the bill. Super discreet and relatively inexpensive. You'll do a spittake at the $/ml of the pods but each pod tends to last 1-2 days so I've found it to be either as expensive or cheaper than most vaping setups. \u000a\u000aThere's tutorials online of how to refill the pods too, which will get you 3-4 extra uses out of each one if you can find a company that does high-pg, high-nic (36+mg/ml) eliquid that you enjoy. 
p145
aVBe careful of heat build up charging inside your purse though, extra heat in enclosed space is not so good.\u000a\u000aTake a look at a product called "Juul".\u000a\u000aIt's not a cloud machine, it's a nicotine delivery system in cigalike form, very small. Quite effective from what just about every user has said that I have read, a few here at ECR have them.\u000a\u000aCould use a back up, or itself an Subvod as back up, if you are just looking to quit smoking that is. If you want clouds, stay the course you are on.\u000a\u000aHope that makes sense an helps.\u000a\u000a
p146
aVSome mtl like the nautilus mini or juul?
p147
aVJust get a juul. Most of those type pens especially knock offs are cheaply made. To me it's worth spending money for peace of mind. Another good actually pen is the x2o pro v vape. It's around 25$ has good flavor and low variable voltage.
p148
aVThe juul is a great device, I can't recommend it enough as a simple stealth vape for beginners and anyone who doesn't feel like getting into the advanced stuff... 
p149
aVI bought a juul a couple days ago...\u000a\u000a[deleted]
p150
aVThe juul is a great device for its class. I was using it for a bit till I found sub ohm vaping.it was good then but now I'm used to getting a lot more vapor and flavor. Still makes a pretty good stealth mod though. I found a way to refill those little cartridges and put premium ejuice in. Works pretty good.
p151
aVThe JUUL is an awesome little device. Just be careful, the pods that they say have a VERY high nic level. You can refill the cartridges pretty easily to save money, but then you don't get the "nicotine salts" that the pods offer. The JUUL is definitely the closest experience to an actual cigarette I have found. With the refilled pods it wasn't quite as enjoyable. 
p152
aVBeen using the Juul for a while and finally made the switch! So... handcheck!
p153
aVTake a look at the juul. Buy the kit and you don't need anything else to start.
p154
aVwhatever you do, don't get a mech/stick/pen vape for varying reasons... mech - too complicated to start with, stick/pen - likely wont cut it.  Get a box mod, get one with TC/VW, with replaceable batteries.  \u000a\u000aI started with a VTC-VT kit, and now would recommend anyone to start by buying a mod an tank seperate.  If you have a physical shop ask them what they have.  I say this cause it would have saved me about $40 (Im in Aus so pricing is ridiculous here) if I didn't get the kit.\u000a\u000a(I don't know about the JUUL their kit tank may be far better than the eGo mega)

aVTrying to find aN online retailer of Juul Pods that doesn't require a 21+ signature.\u000a\u000aSo I love my Juul.  Unfortunately, I live near an area that bumped up the age to 21 for all local retailers, and the closest one in the 18+ area that sells Juul pods is about an hour drive, so two hours round trip.  \u000a\u000aJuul's website requires a 21+ signature, and given I'm 18 it doesn't really work out. \u000a\u000aAny help would be greatly appreciated, and since I know this isn't a sub that likes advertising, I'm not sure what the best method of this is.  Any advice is appreciated.\u000a\u000aEdit: so I just decided fuck it.  Ordered from the Juul website, and I'm just hoping the USPS guy will be chill like the last one and let me sign for it anyways.
p158
aV... additionally, you might want to look into the Juul (Google is your friend), as it might be a good transitional device from cigarettes. 
p159
aVI've had alot of friends switch from 100$ mods to the juul. I'd highly recommend it. 
p160
aVRecenlty bought JUUL for my grandmother\u000a\u000aHey, so I have been trying to get my grandma to stop smoking cigs. I told her about vaping as an alternative, and she agreed to try it. I bought her the JUUL stater kit and she loves it. I honestly do not know much about vaping, however most of my friend do have MUCH different setups(mods or whatver) as compared to the JUUL. I've looked up reddit posts about the JUUL and it seems it is not looked highly upon the vaping community. Did I mess up buying her this thing??
p161
aVYou did a good thing!  If she likes the juul enough to not smoke, that's great.  Maybe sometime she would like to try something like the AIO so she can have more choices of flavors, nicotine level, save a few bucks in the long run.  From what I understand, the juul is very high in nicotine, and on the expensive side.  But it's not like your grandma needs to blowing huge clouds.  Unless she wants to!
p162
aVImo a juul is a great device. Only problem I had with it was it was just too much nic for me
p163
aVAnything is better than a cigarette, my friend!\u000a\u000aIt's true there are better devices than the JUUL but they come with a price and require research. You've done a great thing. If she keeps it up do the research and spend on a much better device.\u000a\u000aThe JUUL will do for now. :)
p164
aVHave you considered a Juul? I use it when I'm doing load in/out days and it suit me just fine. Super stealthy and hits nice! 
p165
aVJust picked up the JUUL and so far it's been great!
p166
aVJuul. [See this thread](/r/Vaping/comments/4qtpc7/today_marks_one_month_without_a_cig_all_thanks_to/) for more info. 
p167
aVI cannot recommend the Juul enough! I have been of cogs for a month with it! Super cheap, super reliable
p168
aVIt's called the JUUL. Each cartridge is the equivalent of 2 packs of cigarettes.
p169
aVThis is the JUUL. I love the simplicity of this device. Each cartridge is the equivalent of 2 packs of cigarettes.\u000a\u000aI bought one for myself and one for my best friend. I vaped for awhile before and had a few mods.\u000a\u000aThese mods (sigelei 150 and tfv4) pushed her away. She had no interest in the vapor production. She just wanted to quit, as did I.\u000a\u000aWhen I stumbled upon the Juul, it was an answer to prayer. \u000a\u000aThanks to that after 7+ years of smoking, she is 2 weeks without a single cigarette!! \u000a\u000aI am so thankful for this little guy!
p170
aVYou say that, but Juul groups are chock full of juice and mod makers who have been in the game for 3+ years.\u000a\u000aIf the goal is a nic fix with the least possible amount of fuss, nothing really comes close to the Juul.

aVCongrats! Hitting a juul is so satisfying but I got rid of mine for a bigger device. The pods are a bit expensive and I wanted to lower my nic intake and unfortunately they don't make pods with less nic
p172
aVHmmm, you're making me think I should buy my dad a Juul. He has a VTC Mini and a Vengeance tank, and he hasn't touched it in months, so he's back on the stinkys.
p173
aVlove my juul. had it for almost a year now and it's still going strong
p174
aVI definitely feel the Juul is a better quitting device for avid cigarette smokers than a typical vape mod. Especially since you can hold it like a cig and has a much much sharper hit than a box mod etc. I love taking it to the bars when I don't feel like lugging around a box mod or have everyone wanting to "chuck some clouds bruh" with my mod. 
p175
aVThese things rock, we just got them in our shop recently and a lot of older people don't want anything big or complicated and we've only had pen styles that they had to refill and buy new coils for. We have a lot of trouble with older customers they hate doing all that but we've only had what we had. Until the Juul and all its beauty, we personally tried them being people that use mods and drippers and were amazed. Simple, small, packs the punch you need and you can still buy premium liquid to refill cartridges if that doesn't bother you or just buy refills. Definitely recommend these to anyone trying to quit smoking but don't want anything crazy. 
p176
aVI used a juul too till I found out about sub ohm vapes and what not. Damn thing is the best of its class. BTW you can refill the cartridges with whatever ejuice Ya got. I put some 80/20 in it and it vaped great just killed the coil sooner though.
p177
aVCongrats. I've spent a ton of money on mods and juices and coils. It's all a huge waste of money. Making big clouds gets old fast. The object is to quit. I dropped all that flashy stuff and went back to Blu. They are much more like a cigarette than the cloud makers. I did try Juul as well. And I did like them. My only issue with them was the short battery life. Puffing on a Blu Pina Colada right now. again, congrats to you both. 
p178
aVHell yeah. This thing is awesome. For reference purposes, I have every type of device and atomizer you can think of. A couple mechs, VTC mini, Cuboid, CF4TC100, 2 AIOs, a T18, a T22, Subvod. Several RDAs, both Griffins, a Subtank Mini, Joyetech's shitty eGo One Mega tank, a Crown, an Arctic V8, the iSub tank. \u000a\u000aMy daily driver is the AIO, but the Juul is perfect for taking with me when I go out with friends. I recently used one after a 10-hour flight. It hit me like a freight train, just like a cigarette would have back in the day. \u000a\u000aHave you tried waving it around after taking a drag? Look at the LED when you do. 
p179
aVJuuls are awesome especially if you're into the whole every day carry scene.
p180
aVWhat are your thoughts on the Juul? Pros and cons.\u000a\u000aI'm thinking of getting one so I just wanted to know what you all might think of it.
p181
aVPros - Sexy stealth package that will never feel like a burden in your pocket or in a strangers face on the street; best throat hit for an e-cig alike (and only cigalike I've ever tolerated let alone incorporated so heavily into my routine). Passable flavors (20+ better ones were tested, but not released yet if ever according to their mum "outreach" team members I've talked to. This might turn into a dealbreaker for me as if I am stuck with this shit tobacco or crem brulee as my only options at 5% nic I might not be using it as much soon. The flavor fatigue on these first four flavors is very real). Extremely potent nic delivery that rivals the spike you get from a real cig [like so](https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/pax-evaluation.png), probably because of the "nic salts" instead of freebase (normal ecig juice) and benzoic acid make this even better for being discrete and not needing too much clouds/puffs to get yer fix.\u000a\u000aCons - Only one nic strength that may be too much for some (they had a spectrum of different nic strengths available for test and when they were out they left a gaping hole in my preferences). Some pods leak (though customer service is great and will replace them). If you don't want MTL vapes, this isn't for you. Some people claim pods are refillable, but this is a dubious claim at best as the atomizer craps out after a few uses anyways and any juice you put in there is not going to match the experience of JUUL juice (which is half the battle for this device for me honestly), while also probably leaking. Last con is the company has been fairly tight-lipped about any plans for their future or test results of options people have been requesting. They'll just point you to a newsletter that has probably gone out once in the 2016 calendar year asking if my dad smokes. Signing up for it will net you a 25% discount on their site, though (not insignificant, especially since its the cheapest place to buy pods that I know about). \u000a\u000aFor such a game-changing device for me personally I just wish they'd up the engagement level a bit. No point in having social media accounts if they are just to facilitate mint restocks.\u000a\u000a
p182
aVJUUL
p183
aV/r/vaporents or /r/waxpen, I don't think any of these do e-liquid.  If they come out with a new Juul though I'd be interested.
p184
aVI talked with a pax rep a while back, apparently they're going to try to come out with juul brand e-liquid. I'm not sure how they're going about it now with the ban and all but he said that the market was growing and they, "really want a piece of that action," his words. The then gave me a free juul and a free shirt. This was back when I worked in a smoke shop.
p185
aVI usually keep the dock in my car and plug it into the 12v, kinda looks like it was built into the dash. The battery does die a bit too soon though. Maybe if they released a new Juul with games like they have on the pax 2. With refillable carts.
p186
aVMy terrible experience with the JUUL by PAX\u000a\u000aLet me start off by saying that when this product works it is fantastic. I love the miint flavor and the draw and nicotine level are very nice. Sadly this is the only good thing I can say about this product. The first JUUL I bought didnt work right out of the box. The actual vape had problems and every single pod dumped all of its juice out into the inside of the vape. I called them and they agreed to send me a new one. I got my new JUUL along with a variety pack of flavors and had no issues. Upon purchasing my next pack of pods every single one of them either leaked badly or didnt fire at all. I became frustrated and they sent me a free pack of pods, all worked fine. Today I got out of work and picked up a four pack of pods ($17.00 is way too much for a pack of 4 by the way). When I got home the first pod I put in it worked fine for about a half hour. When I removed it, it had dumped half of the pod into the vape. I decided to try the second pod in the pack which pulled a horrific amount of juice into my mouth ( I promise I wasnt pulling too hard I am used to it by now). I put the third one in, didnt fire at all, then the forth, didnt fire at all. I called and they said they would send me another pack but it wont be here for five days. Now I have to go out again to the store, buy another pack at $17.00 and drive back home and pray to god that this stupid thing will work. That is $34.00 in juice today. I am beyond frustrated and sick of dealing with this thing. I understand its the first version of the product but this is ridiculous and I expected better out of a company like PAX. Anyway, if you are looking to getting one of these I would avoid them like the plague. I'm sure the kinks will be worked out for the next generation but for now its honestly a piece of shit. If anyone has any tips or recommendations I would greatly appreciate it. Have a good day everyone.  
p187
aVIdk what to tell you I use mine everyday and have never had a single problem with leaking or anything.  I've had pods for local stores, juul and eBay and all have been fine. 
p188
aV42mg? Was he running a dripper/sub ohm tank or was it out of a lower power set up? IIRC the Juul is 50mg and really low power and most people I know cannot chain hits off it without getting messed up real quick. 
p189
aVThe mini volt is great for stuff like that Or get a juul. Love mine. 
p190
aVI've heard only good about juul, but it's MTL right?
p191
aVOn my desk at the moment are Cloupor Mini+/Kayfun Mini V3, Ego AIO, Juul, IPV D2/Griffin, Mini Volt/Nautilus X and Kilo Edition SnowWolf Mini/Serpent Mini
p192
aVJuul is the only cigalike I've ever found to be useful.
p193
aVI originally quit using Blu, almost went back to smoking but luckily went to a vape shop and got a better setup instead.  Blu aren't very good.  Juul is really good if you want a cig like experience but none of the other cigalikes are very good in my experience, might get you by for a while if you needed something really small though and Juul isn't available in your country since they're U.S. only right now.
p194
aVIf juul makes it out the gate I'll pretty pleased. 
p195
aVI have buuen using a Juul for a couple weeks. and sometimes in the morning when I use it, I get a traditional heavy nicotine rush. no ecig has ever done this for me. is it because of the different way they use the nicotine (salt vs. freebase) or the unusually high (5%) nix volume.
p196
aVI'd say it's because of the amount of nicotine. I used to have a juul and it's honestly really nice for a e cig but the pods are expensive ($17 where I live for a pack of 4) and it's too much nicotine imo 
p197
aVWhat do you think about the Juul?
p198
aVYou could check out the Juul, try starting out with that, it's a little over 50 mg/ml and definitely provides quite the nic hit, based on your habits it might be expensive though to go through a few of those pods a day but I guess probably not more expensive than 3 packs a day of smokes.  After you get off the cigs you could work your way down later but definitely get off 3 packs a day, I can't even imagine what that's doing to your body.
p199
aVSo a few days ago someone asked me to post the pocket mods I used because I described a few.  So here they all are for size comparison purposes.\u000a\u000aFrom Left to Right:\u000a\u000aGoblin Nano on COV Mini Volt\u000a\u000aJuul by Pax\u000a\u000aAspire Plato w/ Triton Mini 1.8 ohm clapton coils\u000a\u000aEgo AIO\u000a\u000aKayfun Mini V3 on Cloupor Mini +\u000a\u000aT-18 Prism Tank on Cloupor Mini 30w\u000a\u000aNautilus Mini on Tesla Two\u000a\u000aGriffin on IPV D2\u000a\u000a30 ML bottle for size reference.\u000a\u000aLately I've usually been carrying the Kayfun Mini V3 or the Griffin combo and the AIO in the other pocket.
p200
aVNoticed a juul there. I think it's the best cig like device.I've been putting 50/50 ejuice in the cartridge and it gives even more vapor.
p201
aVI do the same basically. I use the juul when I'm outside my work van and my mod when I'm in it. As for the pods I had same leak problem at first with high vg but when I changed to 50/50 didn't give me probs .don't know if you filled it the same way but I pull the black cap off then pull out the rubber stopper ,fill and put it all back on. Lasts a half week before I burn out the coil. :)
p202
aVLast cool rebuild ever:( tomorrow I will be a proud owner of the Juul.
p203
aVJuul works great for a quick nic fix, don't use that thing like you do your Subtank though, it's a TON of nic, 50mg/ml.  The cartridges also are only .75 ml so you can go through them quick without realizing it and they cost $4 a piece.  I use them for work when I'm going to be at customer sites and don't want to be pulling out a box mod but I'd imagine it would be quite expensive as a solo device.  It would be nice if you could refill them, I've tried but never found any juice they could take that wouldn't flood and leak like crazy.
p204
aVDon't quite understand how one could choose something like the Juul over a full-sized RTA or a normal tank... There are just so many limitations coming with the Juul.\u000aIf it's only for not needing to build no more coils, then why not a normal tank?
p205
aVHow is the juul much stronger? Just curious... Last I checked, couldn't you just build a higher ohm coil, go mouth to lung and raise your nic content?
p206
aVJust picked up this thing. It is called juul. Check it out, it's unreal.
p207
aVThe USB Charger on the Juul destroyed my hard-drive\u000a\u000aI'll keep this short. \u000a\u000aI've had my Juul for about a week and I've loved it. It's really helped me quite smoking. Unfortunately I made the mistake of plugging the charger into my laptop's USB port. \u000a\u000aTurns out those magnets on the device and the USB charger are really really strong. Strong enough to damage my hard-drive.  It was stupid, I know, but it either happened right as I plugged it in, though I may have stupidly gotten the charger too close when I was looking for the right USB port, it is possible. But anyway, I learned my lesson. \u000a\u000aAside from that though, I do love it. For me design is half the battle with e-cigs and the Juul looks great and hits pretty damn well. 
p208
aVJuul seems pretty well regarded here as far as cigalikes go (I haven't tried it). https://www.juulvapor.com/\u000a\u000aStill, the best way to start is an eVic VTC Mini starter kit.
p209
aVThe juul I'm not sure if you would call is "disposable" but it is and your best bet for sure. 
p210
aVInnokin Endura T18.  It was designed around the idea to transfer smokers to vaping.  Not too much power.  Comfortable mouth to lung inhale (mimics smoking).  Easy to fill tank.  Very high quality vape for a "starter" setup.  Or the Juul if you want something smaller (almost like a very high quailty cigalike).
p211
aVthe pax juul IMO. very high on nicotine though
p212
aVNah just get a juul. They have like 50 nic, so no clouds just the buzz. That's what I use at work
p213
aVThe JUUL!
p214
aVBest pod mod system?\u000a\u000aSo I am looking for something smaller and more discrete than my normal rig and am considering a pod system vape.  I hear there are some great ones out there and want the community's advice.  I know a couple big names out there are Juul, my von earl, my jet, sauron air, phix and Blu. I really like brewelle and am leaning to towards the phix but hear that pod leaking is a problem. \u000a\u000aI want something that has a decent throat hit, small clouds and minimal problems.  The cheaper the better. 
p215
aVAgree, it was my first 'real' mod (my first was a juul-esque unregulated device), and I've loved it so far.

aVJUUL. Looks like a USB drive. Not customizable unfortunately. 
p222
aVYou're not really supposed to use salt nicotine e juice on a rda or other sub-ohm device. This is because usually too much power is running through it for high concentrations of nicotine and you need to be careful about overdoing it. Salt nicotine e juice are meant for devices like the sourin air, juno, juul, etc. You can find many of these devices in vape shops or online. The key difference between one of these devices and your rda is that the ohms (resistance) is much higher and the power is much power. This let's the device have a harder pull so it feels more similar to a cigarette. Useful for people trying to quit. I would not recommend using salt nicotine e juice on an rda, that just sounds like trouble if you ask me. 
p223
aVJuul's spontaneous popularity\u000a\u000a About a week ago, I was talking with one of my friends who works at a gas station and he was telling me of how much high school age kids are buying them. This past weekend I was at a party with some friends from high school and about 3/12 people there were hyping up their juuls. I graduated about 2 years ago, and back then, we just had the pen mods (or the box mods if you had the $$$). I was just wondering when did juuls blow up in popularity?
p224
aVIdk when specifically but it sucks that so many youngins use it to get \u201cbuzzed.\u201d Although, it is better than smoking, so that\u2019s the only bright side. It was instrumental in getting me to quit. The product works for this purpose. (As much as I hate to say it, because JUul isn\u2019t very \u201cvape community\u201d friendly.) 
p225
aVYeah, definitely this, you can legit JUUL anywhere and get away with it.  The \u201cclouds\u201d almost dissipate instantly, and you get your nic fix quickly(Not condoning Vaping where you\u2019re not supposed to smoke, just stating that it can be done with this device).
p226
aVI'm a college student and a weed smoker. Some of my friends enjoy mixing weed and tobacco (chops, mokes, moles, spliffs, etc.) and want to stop using straight up T, so they bought Juuls to get their nic fix. They're easy to hide and use because of the pod system, but I prefer my mod. You can't control the strength of the nic which is a draw for some people because they're used to the strength of cigs, but a turnoff for me since I'm sensitive to nic and prefer 3mg juice. 
p227
aVWhat do you mean by this? I\u2019m a pack a day smoker and was looking into switching to the Juul. 
p228
aVI quit smoking instantly with the JUUL, it was so much better than this blu ecigs or any other cigalike that I tried, because I didn\u2019t really want to become a \u201cVaper\u201d with a huge mod and all that stuff... but then I tried an AIO device, then I got a nicer AIO device... then I got a pico, then and alien, then a Battlestar, then a mech, and attys galore... and more mods... but I haven\u2019t had a cigarette since the first time puffing on a juul.
p229
aVPicked up a Juul for the same reason. Stay strong man. 
p230
aVHey did you figure something out. ? I'm trying to mix it with trgulat strength juul nic salt.
p231
aVmay as well use it as an excuse to scope out a juul ¯\u005c\u005c_(\u30c4)_/¯ 
p232
aVI was told the Endura T20S is great for MTL vaping. But it is a vape pen, not a small box mod. Glad to know that the coil lasts. I will put it in my wish list and JUUL or Breeze delete. Yesterday someone says they do not provide much flavor. 
p233
aVLuggage being shipped to Singapore with Juul pods???\u000a\u000aI arrived in Singapore a couple days ago, with the plan of bringing lots of juul pods for my friends. I figured I would be able to get through customs fine. However, when I landed, my bag was not there, and they are going to deliver it to my house in a few days. When my bag arrives in Singapore, will they scan my bag? I took all the pods out of the original packaging, but will they still recognize the juul pods as e cig juice if they find it in my bag? There are no juuls, only pods. Will they only confiscate it or will they fine me? \u000a\u000aAny help would be appreciated 
p234
aVNever vaped but want to start vaping with CBD. Need help\u000a\u000aSo I\u2019ve never owned a vape before but more recently have been interested in the effects of CBD. I need help with figuring out how I\u2019m gonna go about this. \u000a\u000aI\u2019m not a smoker so I don\u2019t really need nicotine. I wanted something small like a Juul, Eon, Phix, Baton, etc. I understand the pods for those companies are nicotine based but I also saw that you can refill those pods with whatever juice you want so I thought I could just refill them with some CBD juice. \u000a\u000aThe Baton caught my eye because the pods are made to be refilled and they even say you can refill it with CBD. But if I were to buy one of these company\u2019s device and pod, how many times can I realistically reuse the same pod? Is there even a limit? \u000a\u000aAgain I don\u2019t really want something that large. The size of something like the Juul is perfect for what I want. If anyone can help me figure out what to buy/do, it would be greatly appreciated. \u000a\u000a

aVWhere can I get a Vaporesso Aurora?\u000a\u000aEvery website is out of stock out them, and saying they won't restock them. \u000a\u000a\u000aThey seem pretty cool, and all my roommates have Juuls, Breeze's and Sourins. Meanwhile I have my mod and it seems kinda out of place when we're all hanging out.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI've found one place that has them for like $35 but MSRP is $25 I'm pretty sure.\u000a\u000a\u000aIf you guys know where I could get one, I'd really love to know!

aVDizziness with regular vape question\u000a\u000aSort of a noob here, but I've got a T-priv with 3mg juice and a Cleito 120, and when I hit it more than 4 or 5 times in a row anywhere from 85w to 120w I get somewhat dizzy, lights get super bright and I pretty much have to sit down. \u000a\u000aIf I use a low wattage vape such as a Juul, or a Sourin Drop, which both use very high nic juices, I don't get this dizziness.\u000a\u000aThis happens even with a fresh coil, which makes me wonder, is it the nicotine or is there something else going on? Has anyone experienced anything similar?

aVPuff activated no nicotine options\u000a\u000aAs the title says. I'm new to the party. Just got a juuls and I love it. I'm basically looking for something like that, but with no/very low nicotine content pods. I was advised by the store staff that juuls doesn't make those. If anyone has any suggestions I'd greatly appriciate it.
p239
aVGet a mini-MTL like the iCare, Breeze or Juul.\u000a\u000a\u000aYes you have to pay for coils or pre-filled pods, but a pack of coils is not that much more than a pack of smokes.\u000a\u000a\u000aLow initial investment and with iCsre or Breeze you can use regular juice.\u000a\u000a\u000aI started with an Envii Fitt and that got me through two weeks. Eventually the B&amp;M near work didn't have   pods so I bought a Breeze so I could refill juice and swap coils. After awhile of not smoking then you can get into the fancy stuff, but step one is one day with no cigarettes.
p240
aVTry the Juul
p241
aVGL, try the juul!
p242
aVTry looking into a juul or other salt based nicotine device. Because it's much higher in nicotine than a traditional cloud blowing vape it can give you that sharp buzz of nic that cigs give you. I smoked and vaped for a few years but I quit cigs in August with the help of my juul. Good luck buddy :)
p243
aVtry a juul
p244
aVIm a recent cigarette quitter. I started with the juul and eventually moved to a sub ohm. I find the regular juice far less satisfying than the juuls nic salt and big throat hit.  But most days I can get by on normal juice. \u000a\u000aAnyways i would get a juul and the tobbaco pods. Those really squash cig cravings for me. Give it a few days of just juul and no cigs and you should be able to quit without a huge struggle. 
p245
aVThanks for the help, I'll look into the juul. :)

aVJuul Help...\u000a\u000amy juul will light up when i tap it or put a pod in but the light won\u2019t fire when i pull, any suggestions?

aVLook up how to clean juul battery. You can push the sled that holds everything out of the case by pushing down the top with a flathead screwdriver or something. From there clean it all up and put it back in. Make sure led is facing the right way. I have to do this every week or so with mine 
p248
aVHonestly I did, then I got a Juul and it helped curbing it until the nic in my vape juice took over 
p249
aVThe Juul uses a consolidated pod which has about the same amount of nic as a pack of cigarettes, it\u2019s much easier if you look it up 
p250
aVI agree, I recently got an xfire which is essentially a smaller and cheaper juul. It's been great, I can take it to work and stealthily hit it, get where I wanna be in just one or two hits, and then pocket it and be chill for an hour or two. Perfect for work or for taking around in public.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMy main mod now only gets used in my car or at home.

aVVaping at Disney: What to Know\u000a\u000aJust completed a week at Disney Word in Orlando. I was very nervous about bringing anything at all but I knew I would need the nic. Here\u2019s my experience and advice: \u000aLike I said, I was a little skeptical about bringing anything at all. I knew it would be packed and I assumed Disney World would be very anti vaping. I was actually surprised to find the opposite. At first I carried around my phix, it\u2019s like a Juul (pen). I would hit it only when I wasn\u2019t surrounded by people which was very hard at Disney, but I still found time. 3rd day in I decided to bring my mech and some juice. So, before you get into Disney you have to empty your pockets and walk through a metal detector. I put my mech and juice in the bowl, walked through, and awaited a long line of questioning, of which never came. The man just smiled and said have a good day. It was the same every day after that. They do not care. I only had one person actually pick it up and check it out. Now, on to actually vaping at Disney. My advice, do not be a nuisance. If you\u2019re in a large crowd of people, have people behind you, or are waiting in line, just don\u2019t vape. Disney has a few different designated smoking areas but I didn\u2019t use one at all. I would wait for an empty spot, take a hit, hold it in (reduces cloud size), then I would always make sure to blow it in a direction away from people. It wasn\u2019t a pain and made Disney 10x more magical due to the fact that I could still rip some sick clouds #vapenation #gogreen And the guards/workers didn\u2019t seem to care one bit. But it was because I used common sense and I would advise anyone wanting to vape at Disney to do the same. Use your head. If I had a kid I wouldn\u2019t want some stranger blowing anything in his face (yes yes take it away, Michael Scott).\u000aIn conclusion, use your brain, choose a proper time to vape, and enjoy Disney. Feel free to shoot any questions my way.

aVJuul device recall\u000a\u000a[removed]
p255
aVI've went through quite a few mtl devices like the breeze.\u000a\u000a\u000a-Limitless pulse is a great pod pen that is basically a long juul that is refillable.\u000a\u000a-Icare2 is a pretty good mtl that is a great upgrade to the 1 despite having iffy coils\u000a\u000a-Vaporesso Aurora is a nifty zippo like mtl that looks like a slightly bigger zippo lighter\u000a\u000a-Phix is kinda garbage and tried to live off the juul hype but due to overpriced pods and difficult refilling the prejuiced pods I can't recommend it\u000a\u000a-Suorin Air is my current mtl nic salt mod and I really like it. Basically a thicker credit card with auto pull but I have heard mixed reviews about the coils.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAll of these I can add more to but I'm on mobile and didn't want to type forever for no reason.
p256
aVIf I was to recommend anything to a starter you could either go the route of a All in one system (means the battery, tank, and mod is all one unit) such as a Aspire Breeze, juul, or suorin air. Buttttttt I would strongly suggest getting a Smoant Charon and a Crown III tank. You will need to buy batteries and a battery charger tho (which may not be the route you wish to take at this early of a stage)\u000a\u000aI would suggest going to YouTube and searching \u201cAIO vape mod\u201d and starting from there. YouTube is your best friend in this situation.\u000a\u000aElement vape \u000aVaporDNA \u000aThose are two very good sites\u000a
p257
aVNp. Head over to the sidebar of r/electronic_cigarette for more useful links. Most beginners are recommended with vape pens (all in ones) or pods (juul, suorin, etc) for starters. Try to avoid Smok products. Though some may have good experiences with them, a lot of threads with issues have been and still being posted. With their mass production comes with poor/unreliable quality. GL!
p258
aVGet a Juul man. The cartridges are disposable and you keep the same little stick without wasting batteries.
p259
aVLooking for a vape that produces less vapor\u000a\u000abasically the title, I have the smok t-priv with the baby beast and the v8-t4 coils, I enjoy it (aside from the shitty QC of the coils) but its way too smoky. I got into vaping because i wanted the nicotine (6mg as opposed to whatever i was using in the juul) and the flavor, i dont care for smoke and what not. I moved back home and now i can't even use the dang thing because it will smoke up my whole basement after just a short bit of chain vaping. \u000a\u000aJust wondering if there where any good small mods, maybe even with an RDA i could put on it, that produce a lot less smoke but still give me nice flavor and dont impede my nicotine addiction. Also, one that takes the same batteries as the T-priv would be cool, thanks.
p260
aVA JUUL would be great for you, or any of the pod likes will be great. 
p261
aVI got a vape to stop juuling since it was so high in nicotine
p262
aVThe myjet or limitless pulse is very similar to the juul except you fill the pods with whatever juice you want. The myjet has a cool external battery pack that really boosts battery life. 
p263
aVYou can refill your Juul pods with 6 mg nic.
p264
aVSunset on the Red Sea, 1st vape handcheck. The girlfriend just bought me an upgrade for when I get home! The JUUL litterally stopped working after finishing the pod in the picture. Can\u2019t wait for the upgrade\u000a\u000a
p265
aVThen get a juul 
p266
aVJuul, penguin, or a Phix would be a good next step
p267
aVThere's also a similar product to the JUUL called the Phix. They both work pretty much the same and are about the same size, but with different designs and names.
p268
aVThe T Priv haha I should\u2019ve clarified. I\u2019ve had the Juul since about late September and it definitely helped me quit the habit, but I\u2019ve always wanted to get my hands on a nicer mod that I can actually tinker with a little bit and today was the day.
p269
aVIt is very heavy, I was shocked. But I am used to carrying the Juul around which is like a usb stick haha
p270
aVIt looks like a phix to me they are pretty comparable to a juul 
p271
aVHow do the bo pods taste in comparison to juuls?
p272
aVEvery Bo pod that ive had has been really gross, the cotton seems to burn instantly on all the pods and the flavors have a really bad feel to them. I just switched to juul a month ago and like it way better 
p273
aVFirst off, regardless of which approach to vaping you take, I hope you\u2019re successful in quitting! That being said, there\u2019s a lot of different products in the vape world. Regular vape juice is freebase nicotine, instead of nic salt-base like is in cigarettes, naturally occurs in dip, and the Juul. The Juul runs off pods that have a salt-based nic so it\u2019s supposedly closer to the sensation you get from the nic in cigarettes and dip. Might want to look into that a bit if regular juice doesn\u2019t work out the best for you. 
p274
aVNot sure if juul or wifi antenna in background.... 
p275
aVAspire breeze. Innokin t18 or t20. Juul. Boulder rock. 
p276
aVGo with the JUUL...best device out there today if you want to quit smoking...their pods are loaded with 50mg of nicotine in 0.7 ml of liquid!
p277
aVThe Juul and Suprin Air are both really good. I like the Suorin better because I think it\u2019s a lot cheaper and you can use your own juice. (Salt nic)
p278
aVPSA to juice manufacturers\u000a\u000aIve been vaping for 3 years now, and I've tried many different vaping setups. From mech mods to regulated box mods to the juul and now other salt devices. The juul has caused a lot of controversy, but only because people continue to seek it out. The pods are expensive as cigarettes (or even more expensive if you smoke cheap cigs) and theyre the best, but nobody wants to pay that.\u000aMy point is, people want to use that juice in their small vapes.\u000aThere are important things to note here, though. Most mint salt based e juices do not compare to juul for a few reasons:\u000a1) The juul has a light peppermint flavor with an icy feel, and also has almost a tobacco undertone on the exhale and when the vapor is smelled. you would be surprised how sought after that aftertaste is.\u000a2) The Juul is 50mg, but it feels stronger than other 50mg salt based liquids. I speculate that this might have to do with the ratios of benzoic acid to nicotine.\u000a3) The juul is the only vape with these features\u000a\u000aTake this into consideration when trying to make a juice to sell to another company's patrons.\u000aThis is america, we stand for the best, and we won't move to something unless its as good or better than what we already have.\u000a\u000aKeep in mind as well that many juul users are sick of the prices though,\u000aso $20 for 30ml of juice (about 37 juul pods worth) is enticing.
p279
aVIMO the juul feels less than 50mg for me. When I refill my pods with salt e (45 mg) I get a greater buzz.
p280
aVI dropped my juul in my e brake housing yesterday. That was a first. 
p281
aVwhat milligram liquid in surion drop?\u000a\u000apicking up a surion drop today, what milligram liquid can i use? someone i know said a salt based nic at 45 mg. i have used 45 in my juul, its nice, but i like to vape a lot, and dont want that much. \u000a\u000ai have a nice 3 mg banana liquid here i love, could i use that? would the flavor be good with 3mg in a drop, instead of a higher mg juice? 
p282
aVif you are wanting something small I would say a phix which is really just a bigger version of the juul but I would say the best thing to do is just go into a local shop and look at some starter kits they have so u can actually look and hold them things like that and see if it is something that your brother would like. There area ton of starters out there now that dont cost a ton just the matter of finding the right one that is right for you. I am sure that there is someone that can help you more then I can. Still new to vaping but when I started I just went into a shop and sat down with someone there and they answered all my questions and really helped me out.
p283
aVTry the Juul. $40 for the pen. Strong pods (50mg of Nicotine) and they\u2019re pretty much fool proof.
p284
aVAnyone know of a vape that\u2019s its like the JUUL but with far less nicotine?\u000a\u000aI really like the size and shape of the JUUL or the Bo Vape but I hate how much nicotine is in them. I know you can refill their pods with juice with less nicotine but I\u2019d still have to waste money on some nicotine filled pod that I don\u2019t like and they don\u2019t sell empty pods to fill yourself either
p285
aVYou can find stealthy vapes that use the regular 3mg-12mg juice. The icare mini is an example. It's a bit larger than the JUUL, but it's still very small. 
p286
aVI\u2019m a fucking fiend. I carry them in a bag with my batteries and tons of juice, which stays in the car. \u000a\u000aI\u2019ll select the appropriate vape for whatever situation arises. \u000a\u000aIf I\u2019m on campus, I\u2019ll take my aspire breeze (not pictured) for discretion. At work I\u2019ll take my 20700 devices as I\u2019m allowed to fog the place out however I please. If I\u2019m boolin at the club I\u2019ll take my G-Priv, set that bitch\u2019s lights on Rainbow Fade and destroy the masculinity of Juul users. \u000a\u000aWhen I\u2019m in the privacy of my own home, I do whatever I want; series boxes, my old Kanger Five6, etc.\u000a\u000aI have so many vapes. I have no idea what to do with this Wismec gen3. \u000a\u000aBut short answer, yeah, my guy. 
p287
aVThere are so many better and cheaper alternatives to a juul. If you\u2019re interested in pod system vaporizers with high levels of nicotene, check out the limitless pulse, aspire brez, or even the phix. And as for the juice, Mr salt eliquid is fairly cheap and it is salt based (also know as nicotene in its acidic form) from 25-45mg.  
p288
aVHell yeah man and it\u2019s my girl friends. I\u2019m more of a mod guy my self. But the juul is nice when I can chuck clouds 
p289
aVI will swear by the Juul for the foreseeable future as a device for someone to stop smoking.
p290
aVjuul is no better than disposables that were around in gas stations 5 years ago, incredibly unsatisfying, but if it works for you then that's all that matters.
p291
aVI think it works fine for getting right off cigarettes but I just can't imagine using it for a sustained period of time. Most people that I know that did use juul eventually went the way of stronger devices and either continue to use those or quit entirely. The pods are expensive, flavor is weak and limited options, and the hit is too throaty for me considering the high PG/VG ratio. 
p292
aVWell heres how the wife uses it. The juul covers her nic cravings due to the high nic content. For the hand to mouth she uses an obs engine with 3mg nic juice.\u000a\u000aThis helped her quit. Because a subohm tank was to much. The vapor made her cough, etc. Like it will anyone who is quitting. The juul is very close to a cig and packs a big dose of nic. Once she got to where vapor didnt make her cough, then she could back down the use of the juul and uses the sub ohm tank for most of the time. Only hitting the juul when nic craving get to be to much.\u000aIf her minikin/engine were lost busted, she would be chill until we replaced it.\u000aBut panic mode would ensue if something happened to her juul heh.\u000a\u000a
p293
aVHeating a juuls outer case\u000a\u000a(After removing all internals!!!) I\u2019ve seen videos of people heating the aluminum with a torch, turning the metal gold. If I heated it past the gold color, would it have a case hardened look? 
p294
aVI have a friend that moves juuls and pods, when I asked him about taking the outer case off, he said that it is much harder to do with newer juul designs. There are probably new youtube videos on how to do it, but its not as easy as it used to be.
p295
aVI remember where I worked people came in asking for either Naked juice or Juul pods a lot of the time. We didn't carry either.
p296
aVThe purple Minikin is awesome!! I love my setup with the OBS engine. The Juul is my baby though. I smoked for 30 years and tried to quit a million times and the Juul is what made it happen. 
p297
aVI'd recommend a juul, not my style personally , but it's compact, holds a long charge, and has a lot of different flavor options. But If you're looking for something with a bit more customization, then something like a smok stick. That way you could change out the juices, coils, etc .
p298
aVThanks for the suggestion. I\u2019ve talked to a few people in my area about the juul, looked fight up my alley, only problem is that they are having serious trouble getting the replacement parts? I (am new to this) can\u2019t remember what they are called but they look like filters for the eliquid, the guy I bought my breeze from said he hasn\u2019t been able to get that part for the juul in 3 months. Didn\u2019t want to risk it. \u000a\u000aIf you don\u2019t mind, tell me more about the smok stick? I don\u2019t need to be able to customize too much, im just gonna get the black and be done with it. Have you or someone you know used it? 
p299
aVA lot of my friends have been using juuls and they seem to work pretty well. I think if you can get him something that is nicotine salts it'll be perfect small, long lasting battery and a great mouth to lung hit if you need any more info you can pm me but you should definitely look into a juul or a juno it's what I've been trying to get my mom to use!
p300
aVEither a juul or a sourin air. The air is nice cause you put your own juice in it and aren't stuck paying way more for packs of pods. Me salt e has great juice for the device as well.
p301
aV\u000aDoes it use proprietary pods like the Juul? Or can you use your own eliquid?
p302
aVI\u2019m returning to the game after a 5 month juul switch. Question about staggered fused Clapton\u000a\u000aI ordered prebuilt staggered fused Clapton coils from geekvape and they\u2019re made from kanthal a1 and ni80.\u000a\u000aWhat would be the proper power setting on my mod for this?\u000a\u000aI\u2019m not using a mech mod and don\u2019t want to blow my regulated mod. Currently using a sigelei kaos z\u000a\u000aThanks fam
p303
aVThe downvotes because your bassically hating on the improvement of technology then bashing it because its not the way you wanted it to improve. Not every vape now and days is a big 8lb hunk of pipe those would be called mech mods and theyve been around since the beginning. Not everbody wants a mod with controls and finnicky menu systems and they have options for those people now like the pod vapes or single button mods like the joyetech penguin or eleaf icare v2 or juuls. but some people like to have the option to make there vape hotter or cooler or use tempature control mode because thats what they enjoy and its what's helped them get off cigarettes. Not everybody wants a small device they can put in there shirt pocket and not everybody wants a big mod that will weigh there pants down but for those who do there are plenty of options weve came so far from where we were in previous years. If you want to use a 3.7v pen with an aspire mini nova tank then thats your choice and nobody is will hate on you because of it because vaping is a great alternative to smoking and has saved so many lives over the years and people arnt worried about how expensive or new your setup is along as your staying away from tobacco. \u000a\u000aNow to awnser the question you asked where can you get ye old pens? Well your in luck discountvapers.com has been around for longer than ive been vaping and the majority of devices they sell are 2013 or older. 
p304
aVNot everybody likes vaping at 15watts. I know I didn't when I first started vaping. I eventually went back to cigarettes. Only once I could vape at 80w+ was I satisfied with vaping. Vaping at higher wattage means more power is required, which means larger batteries, sometimes two or three of them.\u000a\u000a I would say most people on Reddit that vape have a device capable of 75w or more and maybe that's why you don't think that vaping has gone in the direction you prefer. But you're just plain wrong. \u000a\u000aNic salts are fairly new to the mainstream and allow those low watt devices to push a lot of nicotine at low power. Juul, sourin air, mi-one, sourin drop all take nic salts. And even if nicotine isn't your thing and that doesn't matter there are plenty of stealth mods that you could fit in the palm of your hand that aren't designed for nic salt.\u000a\u000aSo the reason you're getting downvoted is because you didn't bother to do any type of research before complaining.
p305
aVTry a Juul or juno pod system. Or a salt nic base. I use 30mg Solace in an Endura T20 and it let's you get your fix with like 3 rips instead of constantly ripping a box mod or something. It's mtl which is good for a new vaper. 
p306
aVit\u2019s pretty good, i use it for stealth and on the go and it\u2019s fairly effective. i like it more than the juul personally. 
p307
aVIf you're looking for something similar to a cigarette, the highest end you coukd go with is a Juul. They're an MTL hit, and give you your nicotine cravings. If you're going for more of a mod of somr sort I'd go with a Smok stick V8 (I know, they get a ton of shit, but my smok stick has lasted me years.) or another stick-lile kit. 
p308
aVYeah i\u2019m using a juul type thing called a juno and i quit smoking cigs. It\u2019s good they have menthol and tobacco flav juice pods

p312
aVYouTube is your best friend. But I agree with the post above me in recommending a juul. It\u2019s a great cig replacement 
p313
aVFor sure- I'm gonna see what I can find on there this weekend. Thanks! And I've heard the Juul is great, from several people- both on here and through friends. What makes it such a great cig replacement? 
p314
aVThe throat hit is damn near identical to a cig. I haven\u2019t smoked for 2 years but damn does the juul hit like a cig. Multiple friends of mine used them to quit
p315
aVGet a Juul they kick your nic cravings out of the window.
p316
aVI'd reccomend a Juul I could never do nic vapes before I tried it. Nic vapes always tasted like crap to me too.. just use a Juul for your nic fix and keep vaping 0mg on your mod(:
p317
aVIf you want to quit tobacco, try getting a phix or a Juul. Higher nicotine and has the same throat hit as a cigarette; it's definitely helped me a lot! 
p318
aVHalf the people i recommend this to. The other half i recommend getting rid of all their old stuff and getting a juul or something mi one. Some old smokers really arent into the whole building scene and just want something simple.
p319
aVFuck this building buying work more shit. If you're a habitual smoker you have to treat it as such - replace your smoke breaks with vape breaks. Dont just vape freely all day like most of us do. Now if u need a real nicotine kick just up the nic and keep it as a "smoke break"\u000a\u000a\u000aFind a setup that works for YOU. Do u like the idea of vaping as a habit? Look into rebuilding! Do you want the most basic, convenient cigalike? Try a juul! Do you want an in between with cool flavors? Your mod right now works!\u000a\u000a\u000aMain thing is, vaping can become a secondary source of excess nicotine if you dont treat it as a "replacement therapy" as it's meant to.

aVBest mouth to lung alternative to Juul?\u000a\u000aHello. I\u2019ve been using the icare 160 for the past couple months, but the inconsistency of the coils is driving me crazy. Out of the last 5 pack only 2 worked well for more than a day. I\u2019m looking for an alternative mouth to lung vape that I can use 45 mg salt eliquid in. Cheap coils are important, but also consistent coils. I\u2019m looking at the Vaporfi air 2, the innokin t18, and maybe the nautilus 2. \u000a\u000aAny help is appreciated 
p330
aVI only make these jokes because iCare. Juul understand what Im talking about soon enough.
p331
aVGood choice my dude! Looking into nic salts lately, should I go with this or the juul?
p332
aVI've tried both the Juul and the Breeze. I really like both but the Breeze is very convenient as you can buy normal juice bottle for refills. The juul uses proprietary juice pods. Whatever you choose will be a good choice ;) 
p333
aVGood non-Propylene Glycol juices for Juul?\u000a\u000aHey guys so I've experienced some hearing problems and ear pressure from the Juul.. I've done some research and I think it's safe to contribute this problem to the Propylene Glycol in Juul pods... \u000a\u000aAny suggestions for highish nic-content juices that don't contain Propylene Glycol and would work well in a Juul pod? Thanks! 
p334
aVGot good and bad news for you. \u000a\u000aGood first: You can get 100% VG juices! You just may have to DIY. If you can stomach just a little PG, tons of online juice sellers carry \u2018max VG\u2019 options which is generally 80-90% VG. \u000a\u000aBad news second: It\u2019s not gonna work in your Juul. The reason the Juul and other MTL devices use PG is it has a very low viscosity, and wicks easily. Max VG has an extremely low viscosity and needs to be used on a dripper or specific type of tank. 
p335
aVMore good news: you can DIY a juice with practically no PG. Bad news: to use in a Juul, you need to replace the PG with PDO or PEG 400. Those can be a bit of a hassle to get, but not much more of a problem than flavor concentrates that don't use PG.  
p336
aVAh, thanks had a hard time with that since I just switched from a juul to the Boulder and the juul always gave me like .5 strength so I was confused 
p337
aV 45 mg. Juul is 50mg. Mr. Salte is some of the best 
p338
aVGuys I need a quick nicotine MG recommendation.\u000a\u000aI used a JUul for a little over a month. I just got a new device with a mouth to lung tank and I will NOT be using Nic salt juice. \u000a\u000aWhat nic strength should I go with? I vaped the JUul about a pod every day and a half. \u000a\u000aAlso former smoker of 17 years before the JUul \u000a\u000a12 or 18?
p339
aVI can't judge based on the JUul, never used it.  But I was around a 2 pack a day guy and the 12 did me pretty good.  I'd suggest trying out a couple 15ml bottles of each and dial in your comfort level.
p340
aVJUUL advice. Proper wicking in the pod.\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve grown very fond of the JUUL. \u000a\u000aI previously went through a wide range of vapes.  \u000aMy favorite was SMOK g-priv, baby-beast tank, the quad cylinders coil, 60w. Any 12mg/ml juice hit was smooth and plentiful. \u000a\u000aBut I\u2019ve since put them all on the shelve in favor of the JUUL. \u000a\u000aLove the powerful hits of nicotine. \u000a\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve discovered that to get strong consistent hits throughout the lifetime of the pod, you need to regularly, re-wick the cotton+coil. \u000a\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s how you do it: \u000a\u000a1.  Pull out the pod\u000a2.  Flick it a couple of times to make sure both wick pickups are completely flooded. If you can\u2019t make a complete pressure seal around both wicks, throw out the pod. You\u2019re too low. Grab a new one. \u000a2.  Gently squeeze the body. \u000a3.  Monitor for the appearance of tiny bubbles around the wick pickups. \u000a3.  Gently ease off the squeezing.

aVJUUL POD REFILL HELP!!\u000a\u000a[removed]
p343
aVBest Stealth Vape for Nicotine Salts\u000a\u000aI have owned both a juul and phix and I love them with all of my heart. However, pods are fucking expensive. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s where I live but pods run about $30 here and that doesn\u2019t last me more than a week. I\u2019m looking into getting a pod style vape I can use nicotine salts in. So far I\u2019ve come up with the iCare 2 and the Aspire Breeze. If you have any new recommendations or experiences with these devices I\u2019d love to hear them!
p344
aVI have the juul and wasn't a big fan of it -- bought the suorin air and I'm in love. Might be worth looking into.
p345
aVBreeze for sure. Similar to the iCare, but better quality. Plus you don't need to press any buttons, just straight pull like the Juul. And they're the same price!
p346
aVHad a JUUL, now I just run 25mg nic salt ejuice in a Nautilus 2 on top of a Innokin CoolFire Mini with 1.6 Ohm coils. Works wonders, saved me cash, and fits comfortably in my pocket always even while at work. 
p347
aVJuul vs. PHIX\u000a\u000aI've been looking into going for a pure nicotine delivery device for on the go satisfaction, and I've found these two to be the most interesting but I can't decide which one to go with. Opinions?
p348
aVJuul is a lot more reliable and is smaller if that appeals to you 
p349
aVI\u2019ve had both so I can inform you on things with these two. First off with the pods, the Juul has way better flavor and the pods are cheaper, but they contain almost 1ml less than Phix pods. The juul has a smoother delivery while the phix hits harsher, but both give you that instant chill effect. Juul is smaller, phix is bigger. Juul is also louder when drawing, if that matters at all to you. I prefer the Juul over the Phix but either one is a good choice. 
p350
aVAnybody know how to refill Juno/Juul pods with your own juice?\u000a\u000aI'm getting kinda tired on spending $20 ish bucks every three weeks to buy new pods for my Juno. Is there any possible way to refill them? 
p351
aVThanks I'll check that out. I was looking into the juul because of its nice size but that thing is way to much nic for me.
p352
aVHonestly it's flavor is much better then the Big Baby Beast I have used on a different mod. It also hits really hard but with good airflow. The Juul has been my go to for a while and the Tfv12 that I was using was not a good alternative neither was the Big Baby Beast. I only use 3mg juice and this tank is super satisfying
p353
aVHelp\u000a\u000aFrom a health standpoint, is it better to constantly be vaping very low nicotine and not feeling a buzz, or using a device like a JUUL and stopping after getting a buzz?
p354
aVHas anyone tried putting Juul e juice in a regular vape?\u000a\u000aI lost my juul but I still have some cartridges. Could I throw this in with a mod I had lying around? 
p355
aVVoltage under 10 is still crazy. Juul liquid is more than double the strength of anything you're supposed to put in a sub ohm setup. Just be careful. 
p356
aVJuul or Juno?\u000a\u000aDon\u2019t know which to get
p357
aVNo, but I hear with the new TFV256 Incestual Son of Dragon Lord you can buy attachments to put pods in it.  The one deck allows for up to 6 Juul pods to be attached, allowing you to take as many as two pulls!
p358
aVI like it a lot. I bought it for when I'm stressed at work and need a quick fix and it does the job. Had a juul too but I like the air a lot better.
p359
aVGet a juul, sourin air, or sourin drop. Use nicotine salts. You will not want cigs anymore. 50mg.

aVBoulder Rock Vape - Malfunctioned Battery Charging Issue\u000a\u000ahttps://imgur.com/G3Fu4fT\u000ahttps://imgur.com/NDLfAC3\u000ahttps://imgur.com/djDS98v\u000a\u000aSo one night, my Boulder battery died as usual, and I plug it into my lamp USB charger that I always use, and no LED turns on to indicate it's charging. I pull it out and then find that I can hit it some more until it dies again, so I continue to get my nic fix again until later in the night it completely dies. The next morning I stick it in the charger before I go to the gym. I come back and I see the whole battery swollen, the button doesn't work due to the battery expanding completely. The USB port smells like a plastic burning smell/battery\u000aLuckily, I email Boulder Co. with the complaint. They issued me to avoid charging my Boulder ports more from 5 volts to 1 amp. Great customer service as well, as they're currently sending me a new one. The boulder has been one of the best low wattage systems, over the juul or anything else hot right now, I've never had any other problems except for this. Pods are super cheap and last around 10 fills and juice gets that perfect nic fix. Plus $10 for the kit doesn't compare to anything\u000a\u000aTL;DR : MAKE SURE YOU'RE SAFELY CHARGING YOUR VAPES AND BATTERIES!\u000a
p361
aVSounds like pods are for you. Please **don't** get any Smok products. Though I have not used one, I would suggest Phix, Juul or Sourin Air. I'm sure the more experienced ones will chime in.
p362
aVUpgrade from Ego AIO?\u000a\u000aI just bought another Ego AIO a few months ago after my first one died.  I noticed this new one is now extremely weak - at full charge it barely pulls at all. I just want something reliable and small ideally, any recommendations on the next vape I should get?  I don't care about cost so much just want something reliable that pulls like a cigarette (not interested in blowing clouds, etc..).  The Juul looks cool but I don't wanna be paying up for cartridges and I think refilling them is tricky - unless someone else says different?  I vape Halo Turkish 3mg.
p363
aVWhat mod?  Also how do you like that berserker. I\u2019ve been looking at them but don\u2019t really understand how the mil works with a big tank. Have only used sub ohm tanks but used to use the Juul pretty regularly and miss that tight draw.

aVJuul usage Day 13-38: 34 days without a cigarette. I was feeling great till last night.\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s some back story so you know my situation:\u000a-17 year pack a day smoker\u000a-Been using A JUul since I quit which was 34 days ago. \u000a-On 150mg Zoloft and .25mg Risperidone\u000a\u000aTwo nights ago I was on a trip with my gf. I forgot to pack my Risperidone, which is the medication I take before I go to sleep. The fact that I didn\u2019t bring it made me feel kinda bad and I got a little anxiety. \u000a\u000aThe next day I felt the same as when I went to sleep. On edge. That night I took my pill as normal and went to sleep. \u000a\u000aThe next day (Yesterday). I had 2 cups of coffee in the morning. A cherry coke at lunch and about a cup of coffee in the afternoon. (I normally drink 2 cups of coffee. Especially when I smoked cigs. I had more most days). I finished my work day. Perfectly fine. I went home and was cleaning around the house. When my hands started shaking a little bit. I figured I\u2019ve been vaping my JUul all day and drank some caffeine and even tho I ate lunch maybe that little bit of caffeine made me jittery so I went to get food. When I did it got worse and turned into a panic attack (haven\u2019t had one in 10 years). I was able to calm it down with a breathing technique. But after I ate I had bad anxiety all night. I hit my JUul from time to time but not as much as I normally would. Then I went to sleep. \u000a\u000aToday. I just feel anxiety ridden. I\u2019m not panic mode but I\u2019m worried about drinking coffee, vaping my JUul. All of it. \u000a\u000aI had heard somewhere that when you quit smoking cigs caffeine has a harsher affect. Is this actually true? Maybe that\u2019s what it was? \u000a\u000aMaybe the JUul just has too much nic? Maybe it\u2019s the nic salts over time? But wouldn\u2019t I have experienced something like this before now. I\u2019ve been using the JUul for a month exclusively. \u000a\u000aMaybe it was just the fact I missed my pill two night ago and the anxiety I felt about missing it carried over? Or maybe missing it set my brain back a bit and it needs a couple of days taking it? (This part is probably for my doctor. And I realize none of you are doctors)\u000a\u000aI wonder if I switch to a more traditional open system and stop using nic salts if I\u2019ll have an easier time? But up until this day I was feeling fine and praised the JUul. I mean 34 days smoke free is good. \u000a\u000aSo what\u2019s going on here? Maybe a mix of all the things I said? Maybe just too much caffeine. Even tho when I smoked I drank the same amount if not more?\u000a\u000aThanks for the help. 
p368
aVIt\u2019s just frustrating because how could I be a 17 year pack a day smoker. Who chain smoked and get nic sick all of a sudden? Is the nicotine in cigarettes that different? Also I had been using the JUul for about a month. Why didn\u2019t that happen before? Maybe just the perfect storm of occurrence? 
p369
aVthat's understandable, almost all parents when you're younger don't want you to inhale nothing, they try and control what you do. \u000apersonally after I quit smoking pot I felt the same way; I needed to puff on something to help mimic smoking weed, my parents don't really care, yet I've never done it infront of them; and they don't search my room or personal space. \u000aI guess in your current state, you should maybe not get a mod and tank, especially when it's a lot of items to keep hidden from your mom. \u000amaybe you should buy a baton, or a breeze or something like the Juuls, not necessarily a juul since those are expensive, but a nice MTL vape pen will work, especially since that's really small, and all you need is salt nic juice, which you can buy anywhere and just hide the juice really well, keep the extra pods in like a old shoe box or somewhere hidden,  and keep the vape pen in your pockets or something, don't leave it lying around ever. \u000ayou should be fine if you can get your hands on a small MTL vape pen since those are inconspicuous and you can always just say it's a " power bank " if anyone asks. 
p370
aVGet a juul. High nic to kill the nic cravings. Then use your snow wolf and smm for the hand to mouth of it. Make sure and use low nic juice(3) for the smm.\u000aThis worked like a champ for my wife. She still does this as a matter of fact.
p371
aVI agree. I have the Juul and the Suorin Air and that's what did it for me. They both use nic salts which much more resemble the hit off a cigarette and allow higher nic without being too harsh.\u000a\u000aStill use my regular mod but any time I get a BAD craving, I take a few rips off my juul or air and I'm good to go.
p372
aVImaging integrating a Juul type of setup into a cell phone. 
p373
aVI've found they don't really care if you have a Juul style, but I wouldn't really even think about pulling out an actual mod at the bar. No matter what the vape smells like, people tend to not like a cloud of anything in their face unless they're the one producing it.
p374
aVNeed to quit juul.\u000a\u000aI'm trying to quit my juul habits because I have a feeling the juul liquid is worse than regular vape juice. I go through about two pods a day and am spending way too much money. I have a box mod but am looking for somthing small that I can easily carry around and use vape juice with. Need to quit vaping all together.
p375
aVI mean as an athlete i haven't noticed a difference in my performance i have been smoking my juul for about a month
p376
aV2 pods a day is pretty intense, thats a LOT of nicotine. It takes me about 2-3 days to get through 1 pod as a recent convert from smoking. Its soooo strong with the high nic i cf t take more than 1-3 puffs at a time.  \u000a\u000aId try to start a lower nic juice. I think one of the juul lookalike devices has 5 and 2.5% juice catridges. Maybe that would be an option. 
p377
aVMight try out the 2.5, do you recall the name? I rip the juul all day and only get a real head buzz on the first drag when I wake up.
p378
aVThe mi one or mi pod is a good option if you want something small. Even the limitless pulse is similar to the Juul but the pods are refillable up to 8-10 times. 
p379
aVSorry i dont recall. Saw it on YouTube tho. \u000a\u000aA start might also be to just try and limit yourself to one cartridge a day.  Im personally switching to a refillable mod soon so i can buy low nic juice. I feel the addiction sinking jn with the juul and i use it a little more every day.  I feel lime to me its even more addictive than smoking was if thats possible.

aVHey guys! I was big into vaping a couple months back and made the stupid decision to sell all my kits because I was convinced I was gonna quit. I now have a Juul and it is hit or miss. I was thinking of getting the Mi One\u000a\u000aAny thoughts on this little guy? I want to get back into the game low-budget. Also, would it be too much to use nicotine salts in this? Like 25 mg? Any thoughts appreciated! Thanks! 
p383
aVWhat's everyone's opinion of JUUL?\u000a\u000aI'm not a smoker or a vaper. But I'm curious about the JUUL. I like it because it's small looks discrete, I'd rather not get one of the bigger vapes that looks like a mini bong. 
p384
aVGood juice for Aspire Breeze?\u000a\u000aI was looking into replacing my Aspire Breeze with a Juul for simplicity's sake, however after trying the Juul, it's just too much nic for me. Anyone have any recommendations for something similar to the Juul pod juice (salt based I believe) just in lower nicotine? The Breeze obviously produces more of a cloud too, so it would definitely have to be lower nic. Not looking for big clouds, just the quick fix that the Juul provides. 
p385
aVquit smoking, got a juul, 3 weeks no smoking! whats next? help a noob!\u000a\u000aI'm brand new to vaping after 15 years of smoking I'm 3 weeks off cigs with the Juul.  \u000a\u000aThe Juul is great, don't get me wrong but man is it ever high in nicotine, it was easy the first week or so to regulate myself to a puff or three every 30 minutes or so, but now I find myself puffing on it all the time even when I'm not craving nicotine.\u000a\u000aI think I need to get a "real" vape that I can refill with juice I choose so I can get lower nicotine and gradually go to a 0 nic solution or quit completely.\u000a\u000aWhat do you all recommend that isnt huge or complicated?  I was thinking of the tube shaped ones a or a smaller box shaped one with a tank.  Don't care about vapor production, just want a nicotine delivery system that gives decent flavor.\u000a\u000aHELP ME!!!!!  This Juul is too potent for me!\u000a\u000aJuice brand recommends are welcome as well, I literally know nothing about them.  I would like to stick to better known US made brands that are reputable with the quality and safety of ingredients used.
p386
aViStick Pico + 18650 Battery + Nautilus 2 (if you want it to draw like the Juul) or the Super Tank Mini (if you want it to draw like a bong)\u000a\u000aThen get some 12 or 18mg juice if you grab the Nautilus and some 6 if you get the STM. Then you can ween yourself downwards from that.

aVSalt liquid suggestions? (Juul)\u000a\u000aHey guys. I haven't been consistently vaping for long, But I'm trying to get away from smoking. I've tried a few things and really like my juul I've picked up. But as everyone knows pods are super expensive. I bought apple cranberry  (50mg nic) from LevelUp and it just isn't the same as the juul. I don't feel the same nicotine fix as I do the actual juul pods. It's still high nic but I think the lack of throat hit with this new juice is what is throwing me off. What do you guys recommend juice-wise? I've read good things about levelup and mixed things in mr salt e and I'm looking for a strong throat hit with high nic. \u000a\u000aThanks!

aVSame boat here, personally I prefer the JUUL when I'm in public and I need a stealthy nic fix-up.\u000a
p397
aVClosed system means you have to buy cartridges/pods pre-filled and can't refill them yourself.\u000a\u000aAnything designed to have the end user put juice into is an open system vape. \u000a\u000aMost things sold at vape shops will be open system except Juul, Njoy, and similar.\u000a\u000aAsk "Show me how to refill it" and if they show you pre-filled cartridgs/pods, that's a closed system.
p398
aVJust picked one up today. I\u2019ve been using the Juul on and off for almost a year now because of the convenience and it has by far my favorite nicotine level out of any vape I\u2019ve tried. It\u2019s super weird that I can\u2019t find anything about the Ciro online though, the package really has minimal info about the product. How do you check how charged it is while using it? Does anyone know what the actual nicotine amount is? I\u2019ve only tried the nectar flavor so far, the cartridge seems to be going fairly fast but I definitely enjoy how much flavor you get from it along with how smooth it hits. 
p399
aVthey aren\u2019t lying. i watch them do it. i go in with my best friend to buy 50mg nic salt juice with him. i know for a fact that they chain vape 45-50 all day for a month or two and they can quit anytime they want because i\u2019ve seen friends of mine quit. they use juuls, juno\u2019s, suorin airs and aspire breezes if you\u2019d like to look up the device they use. 
p400
aVThe Juul uses nicotine salts. It's going to be high in mg because the voltage is miniscule.
p401
aVYou're right about not getting addicted, but in those low wattage devices nic salts with high nic levels are pretty common. It's the same kind of juice in the juul.

aVNeed Vape Pen/Store Recommendations\u000a\u000aHey guys, I want to quit smoking after 7 years of non stop smoking. I've been looking at some brands (V2, Halo, Juul, etc...) and I'm not sure which one would be the best. \u000a\u000aJuul looks pretty nice and simple but I'm guessing it's a bit on the overpriced side as a tiny 2ml cartridge is around 4$. But the convenience of not having to buy atomizers and replace parts seems nice. \u000a\u000aHalo looks pretty affordable in terms of the Vaporizer (I think), but the juice is kinda expensive (~$22 for 30ml) although that could be the average price for juice as I literally have no idea about anything.\u000a\u000aI have the Halo Reactor Mini in mind. It looks good and reviews agree with me. But I'm taking your guys' advice since there's always people out there who are experts in this field. Looking for one of those pens with screens, like the Reactor Mini.\u000a\u000aI'm mainly looking for the best I can get by not paying so much as I'm currently broke af. Any help is greatly appreciated about pens and juices. 
p404
aVi just got mine last month :( im disappointed , my juul lasted longer :/ 
p405
aVWhen I was quitting cigs (unbelievable I succeeded), a cig a like helped greatly in addition to vaping. I\u2019d use the JUUL with the tobacco flavor (recommended) and/or the mint (former menthol smoker) after meals, when drinking/partying, drinking coffee, etc. All \u201ccigarette triggers\u201d called for my juul while I was getting used to vaping. I attribute my success in quitting to cig a likes and vaping combined, one alone was not sufficient. Has she tried a cig a like? Such as a juul or a logic/blu? The juul tobacco flavor is spot on for Marlboro reds. 
p406
aVThinking About Trying Juul\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve been a daily vaper for a little over 2 years. I went from smoking a pack and a half to using an ego pen with 24 nic. I moved a mod set up, Innokin Cool Fire IV with an Apex tank. I liked the big clouds and used a max vg juice.\u000a\u000aThese days, I have a TPriv with a T8 coil. I use a max vg juice at 3 nic. It\u2019s great but I generally like to chain vape and I\u2019m finding that big clouds aren\u2019t great when I\u2019m on the go and I\u2019d like something more portable and a little more discreet.\u000a\u000aIdeally, I\u2019d like to keep my box mod set up for home and something small for my purse. I\u2019ve been hearing a lot about the Juul but I worry about the nic levels and don\u2019t really want to take steps closer toward smoking again. For Juul users who also vape with box mods-what\u2019s the difference?\u000a\u000aAny advice or opinions?
p407
aVJuuls I take a couple hits on and I\u2019m fine for a while, mods are more fun and need a bunch of hits for me to feel anything but I have both. Juuls are amazing for concealment
p408
aVJuuls have virtually eliminated any desire for an analog, with a real nice form factor. But god damn that nic level is something else.
p409
aVJuuls really knock you on your ass, and personally I don't really feel the need to vape unless it's somewhere I can use my box mod (e.g. parties, dorm, friend's places).\u000a\u000aI think the nic is great but I'll say the flavor really isn't that great.\u000a
p410
aVI love all the new pod system, however the Juul is not as good as the PHIX by MLV. I think until today with all these pod system products on the market, the PHIX is still the best. 
p411
aVKeep in mind Juuling is a lot more expensive than vaping if you want to chain-vape. I go through about a pod a day which adds up to roughly 35 dollars a week.
p412
aVAlright here we go! Need recommendations for my first mod and tank. (Coming from a Juul)\u000a\u000aHello. This subreddit has been very helpful to me and the encouragement and knowledge has helped me stay off cigarettes for around 15 days. Thanks! \u000a\u000aI like the Juul but even that is not satisfying me. It\u2019s not the nicotine addiction. It\u2019s just I\u2019m looking for MORE flavor and MORE vapor (not clouds bro clouds just a little more) but where I can still get a nice MTL hit. Or maybe I can do DTL, maybe I need to try DTL (maybe that will fulfill that feeling that\u2019s missing?)\u000a\u000aI need suggestions for the \u201cperfect\u201d set up for me. I am going to list my perfect world setup (in addition to what I said above):\u000a\u000a- internal battery is a must.\u000a- Be able to change coil head while tank is still full of e liquid.\u000a- juice flow control (can turn it upside down)\u000a- coilheads are readily available online and in B&amp;M - and cross compatible (preferably in ceramic but it\u2019s not required)\u000a- coilheads last long\u000a- Pocketable (not a deal breaker)\u000a- easy board usage. (User friendly interface)\u000a- little delay when firing \u000a- MTL preferred in tank but if you can provide a good reason to go DTL I\u2019m all for it. \u000a-battery safety protections up the wazoooo\u000a- no loud whistle when taking a drag \u000a- in stock online at a legit USA based store. \u000a-variable wattage\u000a\u000aBasically anything that doesn\u2019t have me missing cigarettes or my Juul. If you suggest something and it doesn\u2019t have one of the things I mentioned explain a workaround or something to that affect. \u000a\u000aThanks!

aVDoes it produce more vapor and have more flavor than a Juul?
p414
aVIDK i´ve never tried a Juul, but you can check [THIS](https://youtu.be/-YtUnCjecqE?t=14m26s) to get a sense.
p415
aVThey taste better than "normal" e liquid imo. You get the full flavour without the taste of the unflavoured VG/Pg and nicotine. They just give a monumental throat hit and nic rush!\u000a\u000aIf you were interested, have a look at the Juul. Uses 45mg (or 50mg? Not sure as I'm in the EU and they're banned over here) but in a tiny portable stick. Lots of people love them!
p416
aVDoes the icare 2 work well with nic salts?\u000a\u000aI have the juul and the mi one currently, I love the juul but pods are expensive as hell for 3ml and the mi one could crap out kinda quickly. That being said does anyone have experience using like 45-50nic with the icare 2? I'd get a suorin air but my shop doesn't sell them and I wanna try the icare. 
p417
aVHow to disassemble the juno by twelve\u000a\u000aHi so Im having a problem with my juno as of now. Green light flashes when i plug it into a charger but thats it, it wont pull when I have a pod on. trying to take it apart because I've read people doing this and being able to fix it, Is it similar to the juul where you push the battery out? im not seeing any screws
p418
aVWhat\u2019s the best current MTL (Mouth to lung) tank available right now?\u000a\u000aThis gets asked a lot. But I have some stipulations: \u000a\u000a- are the coilheads easily accessible and do they work with other tanks also is it a tank that other coil heads can work in. \u000a\u000a- has a tight draw that produces more vapor than a Juul. And has better flavor than a Juul. \u000a\u000a-doesn\u2019t leak (often)\u000a\u000a- top airflow preferred but not required. \u000a-
p419
aVThe nicotine itself is more expensive. The juul is salts as well as most other pods. The device doesn't necessarily have to be a pod system, you can run salts in a nautilus mini no problem. 
p420
aVyes juul's are nic salt, suorin air is a very simple system as well you just turn it on and take a pull to hit the vape.
p421
aVI feel you. I currently use 6mg too, and for the \u201cfix\u201d I also have a juul to quickly help myself when I feel sleepy at work or when I feel like my body need some nic to function right. Before the juul, I would chain vape a lot with 6mg juice (I also use 2 different setup at a time to switch in case one get hot due to too much vaping) and I also on/off with actually smoke 1 or 2 cig a day when I need a big pump of nic, also any regular juice with higher nic than 6mg make me sick. With the juul, now I\u2019m cig free for 2 months already. Recently with the \u201cice\u201d edition of juice coming out which have added menthol to the flavor, I could start vaping on 0mg juice just fine and not feel like craving nic like with non-menthol 0mg juice (of course I had to puff on the juul once in a while but when I\u2019m at home and can chain vape, I can easily vape 0mg and feel fine). \u000aSo in the end, I found out I\u2019m craving the menthol element more than the nic itself. If I\u2019m stressed out, I still need nic nonetheless, but in general, I can go on with 0mg. \u000aIf you can, I\u2019d say try some juices that have menthol/fruit in their mix with menthol as the main flavor and see if it helps in the long run.
p422
aVWhatever you do, don't get him something pen-styled that will break like a pencil in his pocket. I do my fair share of rough housing in the garage and bending down or kneeling has broken more pen vapes than I'd care to admit. To be honest, your dad might be a great fit for a Juul, which is about the size of a 5pack of wrigley's gum, and costs about 50 bucks. You can get them at most convenience stores and gas stations too, and refills arent hard to find. There are no buttons on it to fool with either.\u000a\u000a\u000aIs it an option to get him on concentrates? There is -some- overlap on parts with concentrate atomizers. Luckily, most of the best atomizers for vaping concentrates happen to be the cheapest crappiest ones that we vaped nicotine with back in the day and they happen to be in surplus and cheap, usually.\u000a\u000a\u000aAs for flower herb, I really can't say it enough. Find a PAX by Plume. They really wrote the book on rock solid vapes that last forever. The new ones dont even have to be plugged in to charge, they just sit on a dock. You can find them used for less than 100 bucks, or sometimes you can get them new for about double that.\u000a\u000a\u000aThere is a very big difference though. You can guarantee that if it is cheap, it's not going to vaporize the herb, it's just going to combust it, and that's such an unpleasant experience, I just wouldn't recommend it. There are so many parts that could melt with that type of heat in there, it'd be like smoking a bowl out of plastic and metal.
p423
aVVaping is personal, so it all still depends on the user. I started with the Kangertech Topbox Mini Kit (Kangertech KBox Mini + Toptank), moved to the Vaporesso Revenger with NRG Tank, then got a Uwell Crown 3, bought a Smok ProColor Kit (with Smok TFV8 Big Baby Beast Tank), and now I've bought myself a Mad Hatter RDTA, Kylin RTA, and Ammit RTA. \u000a\u000aMy SO on the other hand started with the Smok V8 Stick with TFV8 Big Baby Beast Tank then moved on to get a Smok T-Priv. I gave him my matte black Uwell Crown 3 Tank as I got myself a blue one. This is his current setup. He got himself the TFV8 RCA deck. He has a Kylin RTA and Ammit RTA on the way, plus the glass extension for his Big Baby Beast for use with the RCA.\u000a\u000aWe both default to sub ohm vaping because we like the flavour explosion in our mouth plus the sensation of inhaling vapour. What was difficult for my SO with quitting wasn't the fact that he craved the nicotine rush (though he does this from time to time especially when vaping my 0 mg nicotine juices), but the sensorimotor sensation of inhaling and exhaling smoke.\u000a\u000aI am thinking of getting him a MTL set up with high nicotine however for the rare times he's seeking that nicotine rush. Perhaps I'll look into the Juul. He won't be using it everyday. Probably just once a month.\u000a\u000aAgain, it's all personal preference. What works for you works for you. No perception on what's "mainstream" should ever dictate to you how you should vape. If you ever feel differently because makes you feel inferior for loving MTL, then just give them the middle finger and vape on.
p424
aVWhat juice do you use in it?\u000a\u000aI ordered some 40 and 45mg salt e juice and I am worried that it might be too strong because I hear the Sauron air hits harder than the phix or juul.
p425
aVI use 30 in my suorin. I use this when I\u2019m out and not hitting it nearly as much. 30 is my sweet spot. I tried a friends 50 and damn that shit hit way harder than a juul. So def under 45 for myself 
p426
aV45 is fine in it if it's salts. I use it and find it smoother than the juul, if the throat hit is a concern. 
p427
aVNyc exclusive Juul pods are here!!!!!!!\u000a\u000a
p428
aVjuul. Really strong and produces a similar amount of smoke to a cigarrete. Uses nicotine salts in their cartridges.
p429
aVI haven't really explored much with nic salts but whenever I do mention starter kits and nic salts, people always mention the Juul to me. Maybe look it up and see if that will suit her? 
p430
aVNah I ended up selling it it was just too much maintenance for me you know? I prefer just a simple juul or suorin where you don't have to replace coils, prime it etc.
p431
aVIt has to do with the large amount of vape you get at once. You can Vape a juul with 50mg juice and a small amount of cloud and get a satisfying hit or you can vape a sub tank with 6mg and get a big cloud and still get a satisfying hit. I remember when 12 mg was 'low' as well but we were also getting weak ego twist hits 
p432
aVI\u2019ve been using a Juul for 13 days. So idk. 
p433
aVI\u2019ve been using a Juul for 14 days. Haven\u2019t had a cig in 9. It\u2019s still not as good as a cigarette:( I was doing really well but yesterday I felt like shit. Maybe the withdrawals are coming in waves? I\u2019m also very bloated and my back hurts. Just a little in the morning 
p434
aVIdk what I want anymore hahahaha I think I want a CIGARETTE that is maybe why I\u2019m feeling so weird. I\u2019ve been using a Juul for 14 days. Haven\u2019t had a cig in 9. It\u2019s still not as good as a cigarette:( I was doing really well but yesterday I felt like shit. Maybe the withdrawals are coming in waves? I\u2019m also very bloated and my back hurts.

p436
aVEver since I quit and started vaping my back hurts in the morning. I\u2019m bloated af. Less relaxed, aches and pains, anxiety. The fuk you call that? Maybe it is mental but that\u2019s just the way it is. Maybe the Juul ain\u2019t cutting it. My addiction was strong. I\u2019m also an ex drug addicted. I am an addictive personality. The hell you want from me lol you giving me tough love?
p437
aVI feel like an RDA isn\u2019t reasonable when you\u2019re busy or out and about. I feel like if I went that route I\u2019d be annoyed and just go back to cigs. BUT. I feel like an RDA is a good at home device. If high nic loses its flavor, a Juul has a lot of nic and I am fine with the flavor. I feel like anything else would taste amazing to me lol 
p438
aVAn RDA isn't a total pain in the ass when out and about, IMO. Luckily though squonking is a thing, and a damn good one at that. Throw a single coil RDA on top, and one 18650 and the juice in the mod lasts me a full work day. I'd actually like to try a JUUL/nicotine salts, I hear good things about the rate/method of nicotine absorption with salts.
p439
aVJuul isn't the best out there, even for stealthy MTL. Japanese Tobacco International also has a minority stake in the business. I don't know if that's relevant or not, but I don't feel comfortable supporting tobacco companies. \u000a\u000aIf you're looking for something satisfying but not a subtank try to Saurin Air. You get a bit more vapor and better flavors.
p440
aVYeah I know what you mean.\u000a\u000aHonestly I'd say your best bet is to stay with the juul or get a phix or something else with salt nic because it is the closest to a cigarette that your gonna get.
p441
aVNice! 17 year smoker here. Haven\u2019t had a cig in 9 days. Been using a Juul. 
p442
aV100 percent get a juul or a phix for Ur mum.\u000a\u000aThey use salt nicotine which absorbs faster and has better throat hit like a cigarette and it uses pods so it's extremely simple to use and there won't be any problems usually.
p443
aVTrying to get off the old cigs and finally took the plunge. My local vape shop came highly recommended and I ended up leaving with this (VooPoo Newbie 80W + Tobeco Mini Super Tank).\u000a\u000aI told myself I just wanted to quit smoking -- that I wouldn't "get into" vaping, but man, the bug has bitten me hard. I guess I should've seen it coming given that I'm already into diy/electronics and used to work as a low voltage tech. Already have plans for my first RDA and a new mod so I can give the girlfriend this one (she liked mine so much she said she'd give quitting a try). I just can't put this thing down.\u000a\u000aI haven't quit yet completely, but in two weeks I'm already down to ~5 analogs a day (from 2 packs a day). Plan on picking up a juul to help for those few hard cravings I keep getting (w/coffee in the morning, right after work, and right after meals are tough for me). Thanks for all the inspiration y'all.
p444
aVjust got a juul, need some help\u000a\u000aso i got this thing charging, but i have no idea when its done, just literally opened the box, its white right now, but the thing says to "tap it twice" to check battery life, so i dont know even know if its charged or not? i tapped it but nothing happened. so i dont know if its just cause i started charging it, or im not tapping it right? tap it where? like against the desk, with your finger? \u000a\u000ahow wil i know when its done charging, its kind of blinking white right now, do i have to keep checking it or will it turn a different color? 
p445
aVShortness of Breath? Help?\u000a\u000aSo I've been vaping for a while (about 10 months) at first an e-cig (Juul) and then i bought a mod about 5 months ago. I stopped hitting the mod for about a month and just recently bought new juice/ coils and took a couple hits. almost immediately I my heart started going and it became harder to breathe. \u000a\u000aI decided to put it down and wait a day or 2 to see if it happens again. \u000a\u000aAnyone else had these issues? \u000a\u000aJuice is 70/30 VG PG, mod is a wismec 228 and atty is a smok big baby beast. \u000a\u000aEdit: no longer as short of breath, i believe i was allergic to the juice. Will update tomorrow.
p446
aVYou hit the mod for 5 months without experiencing this? Then you stopped hitting the mod for a month? During that month did you hit the Juul?
p447
aVJUUL usage day 9-12: It has been 9 days since I\u2019ve had a cigarette. 9, frickin\u2019, days.\u000a\u000aI haven\u2019t had a cig since my day 3 update. So that\u2019s cool. I am however starting to think about what device I am going to get as an upgrade to the JUUL. I\u2019ll probably do a separate post about that. \u000a\u000aI am waking up with a weird sensation in my back though. I wake up with slight back pain. I wonder if it\u2019s because the cig chemicals are still working their way out of me or if vaping is causing this. Obviously I prefer the former. It\u2019s not a lot of pain but it\u2019s there. \u000aOther than that I\u2019m doing okay. I do think about cigarettes sometimes - when I do I just hit the JUUL and it goes away.\u000aI am still going through a juulpod every day and a half so I am actually getting less nicotine than I did with cigarettes-this is a plus. \u000aI am waking up in the morning easier. Anyone else experience this? I wonder why that is. Hmmmm\u000a\u000aEdit: It\u2019s been 8 days. Fuck. My bad \U0001f917 
p448
aVAfter breaking 4 Juuls, I switched to the Phix, which I actually liked better, until it broke. Now I'm vaping on an Aspire Plato. The juice in a Juul/Phix is definitely more satisfying when trying to get off tobacco, I personally would say wait until after the cravings end before you try and switch to something that is going to give you a straight to lung hit because it doesn't resemble a cig as much as the mouth the lung high nic hits do 
p449
aVI have personally never liked a tank/mod mouth to lung setup nearly as much as the Phix or Juul and there is only like one company that sells juice remotely close to the juice you are currently vaping in the pods. Just letting you know before you try to upgrade or whatever and can't get nearly as good of a hit
p450

p451
aVSo I\u2019m fucked is what you\u2019re saying. Because the Juul isn\u2019t cutting it right now. 
p452
aVThanks! If it's the mi one though, no worries? Because the battery is in the unit, if not I have my juul.
p453
aVcheck the Juul, Eleaf icare mini or Aspire Breeze and see some reviews about them.
p454
aVJuul is probably the best way to go to quit smoking. 
p455
aVOthers will probably suggest the Juul, and they're not wrong. However I'll go against the norm and suggest either a SMOK Stick v8 or Kangertech Subvod. Both very nice pen style vapes that will produce a much better vapor and will probably last longer too.
p456
aVIf you smoke lites or anything less than a pack a day, do not go with the juul. You will find it very harsh and way too strong. Go with the icare mini and just buy your juice with your preferred nic concentration. Go with any refillable ultra portable device, really. That way you can tailor the experience to your own personal preference. 
p457
aVCan you refill the pods yourself? The insane pod prices always were a big deal breaker for me. I just recently realized it's possible with a Juul which spiked my interest in those tiny setups again. Haven't pulled the trigger yet but I'd really like something very portable and lowkey for when I'm out and about.
p458
aVIt can mess up your juul though
p459
aVThat's a pity, I think the Juul is meant to be similar
p460
aVGet a juul. More on the pricey side but IMO it\u2019s the best MTL device out there. 
p461
aVDay 7/8 using JUUL: I have been going through a pod every 1 1/2 days - which is pretty good. So I actually must be getting less nicotine than I did with cigarettes-also good.\u000a\u000aI still can\u2019t taste the flavors all too much. My taste buds will probably slowly come back but I also imagine it\u2019s due to the high nic content. \u000a\u000aI placed a subscription order through the website because that seems to be the cheapest way to get pods although they charge a high tax fee. I still need to do the math. I ran out of pods so while I wait for my order I went to a vape shop to get a pack of pods...\u000a\u000aGreat guy that worked there. The shop only had Smok mods and an Ego AIO\u2019s. But they had a ton of e-juice. He let me hit a Smok Alien mod (not sure what tank was on it) with 6mg nic juice. It\u2019s nuts how much more vapor it produces compared to the Juul haha. I couldn\u2019t tell if the nicotine was affecting me or if I was just nervous because the vapor just shot into my lungs. It\u2019s actually pretty crazy. I enjoyed it it was just a bit scary. Not ready to make the jump yet. Very soon tho. I\u2019m thinking of getting a MTL device. Maybe an innokin T-20 or something. Or even a Mi-One. \u000a\u000aI need to figure out what nic mg I\u2019ll be using in my juice. I want to be able to hit my mod the same amount as I do with the Juul. The Juul is nice because it\u2019s all laid out: a pod = pack of cigs (regarding nicotine content) I like the simplicity but I want to choose juices and save money. \u000a\u000aI\u2019m another day smoke free. I haven\u2019t had a cigarette since my day 3 update. \u000a\u000a(Pack a day smoker for 17 years). 
p462
aVThe vapour probably shot to your lungs because the tank and coil was for Direct to Lung hits with sub ohm vaping. Your Juul is MTL and offers, as close as possible, the experience of smoking a cigarette. \u000a\u000aYou just experienced the difference between a MTL set up and a DTL.
p463
aVJuul pod contains "50" mg of nicotine in each pod per milligram of juice. I am not sure if they are using Nic salt, but I own a couple of Phix by MLV and I am hooked on the nic salt liquids. I recently just purchased the Eleaf iCare 2 which you can fill your own nic salt juices and the store by my house carries many freat flavors from popular brands that I can trust. So far I am loving it. I also have a few friends who uses Juuls on their daily basic but converted to the Eleaf iCare 2 because it's so much cheaper and last way long. The iCare last almost 2 days per charge and a 30ml bottle of Nic salt liquid is about $25 - $30. A bottle of 30 ml can lasts me up to 3 weeks. So I think you're looking to get a MTL device, the iCare is a device I recommend. It'a just about twice the size of a Juul but same length.
p464
aVjust get a juul. noob.
p465
aVDay 6 using Juul: Yesterday was my first day in 17 years without a cigarette.\u000a\u000aPretty crazy. After I had the last cig on day 4. I felt terrible. Started sweating felt heavy. So yesterday on day 5 I didn\u2019t have one. That\u2019s an effing milestone. Getting paranoid though as this seems too good to be true. \u000a\u000aIf I had a sensitivity to PG on day 6 id know about it right now right? \u000a\u000aI don\u2019t want some horrible thing to happen and make me stop vaping because it actually does get me off cigs. And that\u2019s the point.  Paranoid lol 
p466
aVAwesome, a lot of people are saying it works, I'm waiting for my starter kit to come in the mail, hopeful but unsure if will really be able to quit smoking. 19 year habit up to 2 packs a day sometimes. Tried vaping a little before but never got into it just heard of the juul the other day and tried a few hits from a co-worker.
p467
aVWhere/when is it appropriate to vape?\u000a\u000aAre you guys ever asked to stop blowing clouds in public spaces? I usually feel out of place with my juul when im ripping in a resturaunt, maybe because I think people dont understand second hand smoke, maybe because the quickly appearing and disapearing clouds are slightly visually obnoxious. I havent been asked to stop yet, but I want to hear some opinions and stories so I never have to be.
p468
aVchill man, Im realizing now you kids are blowing fat clouds, the juul just doesnt do that
p469
aV&gt;you kids are blowing fat clouds, the juul just doesnt do that\u000a\u000aCigs don't blow fat clouds either, but it's still obnoxious to do around other people in public areas, let alone in a restaurant.\u000a\u000aAnd I'm definitely not a kid, yet you're the one acting like one.  Like I said before just use some common sense... not everyone is familiar with what vaping is, and the way to educate them is NOT doing it in a fucking restaurant full of people and acting confused as to why you're getting dirty looks.
p470
aVGet them a Juul.

p474
aVHow is the Juul working for you?
p475
aVThere is only JUUL!!!
p476
aVMy local shops seem to favor phix over juul. I picked one up last week and honestly I'm a pretty big fan. 
p477
aVI still have regular box mods and I\u2019ve also started using the Phix it\u2019s a bigger version of the Juul 
p478
aVHow much do Juuls cost?
p479
aVI have been dipping for 5 years and smoking on and off, picking up a Juul after work today
p480
aVCan confirm. At my college unless it's a JUUL then vaping is looked at as tacky 
p481
aVSo from my understanding, your looking to get back into vaping, but don't know where to begin. Thats completely understandable because getting into these kinds of things can be tricky at first. Let me start by explaining about vaping, that might be easier to understand. So you obviously know that vaping is an alternative to the sticks, to help you quit. To understand Wattage, and resistance. These are some basic electricity principles that we should look at. Wattage how fast electricity can be pushed through a wire or circuit, resistance is the wires ability to resist the flow of electricity, and voltage is the amount of electricity flowing through the wire. Typically for vaping, we look at wattage and resistance (resistance measured in ohms) to determine what we run our mods at. There are formulas that help you identify what wattage you should be running at when it comes to vaping, but for the most part, a pre-built coil will allow typically tell you what to run you wattage at for mods. So for example, i have my mod with a uwell crown three tank. The pre-built coils i use are labeled on the side with the resistance of the coil, and the range for wattage i should run at. So lets say i have a .2 ohm coil, i can typically run at 70-90 watts without burning the coil out. Now to address what you stated earlier about you coil for your alien, yes, your coil is bad and needs replacing, they sell coils online and in local shops, when you go in, just ask the local shop "hey i need new coils for my X tank" (X being whatever tank your using) From my understanding, you have a kit for your alien, so you probably have a tfv8 baby beast, or big baby beast.\u000a\u000aNow that you understand better, let me make a recommendation for you to try that will help you quit the sticks all together. The device i'm linking is called a juul E-cig. The way these little guys work is you just puff on it like a normal cigarette, and after a certain amount of time, you replace the pods which contain the ejuice. This is a neat little device thats portable, easy to use, and user friendly.\u000a\u000aLink: https://www.juulvapor.com/shop-juul\u000a\u000aIf you have any other questions please ask
p482
aVHeavy smoker here and on day 5 of using the Juul and it does work. \U0001f44d
p483
aVAnyone own a Juno experiencing burnt taste issues?\u000a\u000aI recently got a Juno, its a competitor with the Juul. I got it cause it was cheaper and I do like it a lot but it starts to taste kinda burnt even before the pods run out and I'm seeing a brownish color towards the bottom of the pod. Anyone know what might be going on?
p484
aVWhen I graduate from the Juul this device from eLeaf looks like a keeper. (iStick Trim)\u000a\u000a
p485
aVhonestly; if youre coming off the juul, id reccomend a Mi-One. theyre about half the size of this, and the tank is internal. its made for high mg juices. for example, i have 45mg nicotine salts in mine. 
p486
aVDay 4 Juul usage: Smoked my one cigarette today and I felt absolutely terrible. That\u2019s a good sign.\u000a\u000aI have a meeting later today so in order for me to feel \u201cnormal\u201d i smoked my one cig a little earlier. Immediately after I finished I felt like complete shit. It tasted heavy and I started sweating. Good to know.\u000a\u000aI still feel slightly bloated tho. I wonder if it\u2019s the mango flavored juulpod and maybe if I try a new flavor I won\u2019t feel bloated? Idk. 
p487
aVSo basically ur juno is a goner. Their support is fucked and you will not be able to get a replacement. Better off getting a juul
p488
aVCan someone point to some documentation on how nicotine is delivered into the body from cigarettes vs vaping.\u000a\u000aI am trying to quit smoking and have been vaping for 3 days and I\u2019m trying to understand how I feel. I don\u2019t feel the same as with cigarettes. View my other posts on vaping the Juul for more info. Just search Juul

aVDAY 3 Juul usage: At work, feel weird. Want a cigarette - haven\u2019t had one.\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve been hitting the Juul all day today since I\u2019ve been awake. I haven\u2019t had my \u201cone cigarette\u201d yet today because I am at work. I wish I didn\u2019t feel so weird. I just feel different and I don\u2019t feel happy or sad or anything. All I\u2019m thinking about is a cigarette. I know once I have it this \u201cmask headache\u201d will go away. I don\u2019t know why I haven\u2019t been feeling those endorphins I usually feel on a daily basis. From my coffee and cigarettes.\u000a\u000a I hit the Juul like 6 times when I vape it. Some strong throat hits that makes me cough and some smooth ones. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m getting too much nic or too little. No clue. \u000a\u000a(17 year pack a day smoker trying to transition to vape)
p490
aVIt\u2019s a Juul so the pods are like 5% which comes out to something crAzy like 50mg or something. Someone can confirm this. 
p491
aVThe juul is a pod system with nic salt juice, I believe each pod has around 45-55mg of nic. It got my dad off cigs after 40+ years of smoking.
p492
aVThe tingling might be the pods maybe use another pod? And ive been using the Aspire Breeze with CRFT Nicotine salt. Works pretty well together. I used to use the Juul but ive been exploring a lot more devices and this was the best by far although it is a lot bigger than the juul. 
p493
aVDay 2 using a Juul: Yesterday I had one cigarette. Today I am having just one.\u000a\u000a(17 year pack a day smoker)\u000a\u000aSmoking one cigarette a day is an improvement hopefully I won\u2019t want the one. The Juul has been working. Just still fine tuning my draws finding the right way to hit it. If I draw too slow the throat hit makes me cough for some odd reason. Too fast and I don\u2019t feel anything. \u000a\u000aI also don\u2019t taste the flavor much, is this because I just need to get my taste buds back from smoking? 
p494
aVI have a Juul as well as a regular box mod. I don't quite get a taste from the Juul since I'm using the mint pods. I feel as if they don't deliver flavor, but I definitely taste the flavors from my box mod. \u000a\u000aWhat flavor pods are you using? 
p495
aVthe cough will go away as your throat gets used to it. more good news, if you keep using your Juul or any other e-cig for that matter, you will eventually not want even the one cigarette.  As mentioned by another commentor, pod systems won't give you a whole tonne of flavour, so if you're wanting more of that you may want to look at a mod/sub-tank system.
p496
aVYeah that's true, I suppose with the 45 or 50mg nic salts in the Juul over-nic can definitely be a legit concern. I started with 12mg in a vape pen, and after my first session thought I had made a giant mistake because my head was *spinning*. After that I got used to it though, and soon wanted more vapor. Within a few weeks I was already down to a 3mg juice in an RDA. I don't think that's necessarily the typical progression (or at least in that timeframe), but I know for me it's become a hobby, and almost an obsession. \u000a\u000aAlso don't beat yourself up too bad if you slip up now and then, but seriously, if you don't buy them it's nearly impossible to smoke them!
p497
aVWell I'd it makes you feel any better, most of those feelings that you got from a cig but aren't getting froma Juul are not from nicotine itself. It's from the additional chemicals that are truly the most harmful for you, but that the big tobacco companies spent decades developing for one, singular purpose: to increase the level and speed of nicotine absorption. So maybe you can get some euphoria from the fact that you're not inhaling arsenic and cyanide and such? 
p498
aVI am going to make an assumption, I'm not a doctor, I assume a low wattage device with high nic juice would proven better than a cloud chasing type setup. Maybe try a Juul
p499
aVDay 1 using a Juul instead of smoking cigarettes: Am I supposed to still want a cigarette? (Because I do.)\u000a\u000aHow long does it take for this feeling to go away? \u000a\u000aA little background:\u000a\u000aPack a day smoker for 17 years. \u000aAddicted to all aspects of cigarettes. (Mental and physical)\u000a\u000aIs it just the first couple of days are weird? I just don\u2019t get that \u201cfeeling\u201d and want more and the idea of smoking a cigarette makes me want to cry because I want one so bad. \u000a\u000aEdit: Also why is vaping making me cough? 
p500
aVAre you coughing while you are vaping or are you just coughing more now? If you're coughing while vaping, could be because the amount of nicotine in the Juul is pretty high and gives a strong throat hit. If you're just coughing more, it could be because when you quit smoking, you start working a lot of crap out of your lungs. 
p501
aVI both vaped and smoked for around a year.  It's been almost 5 years now since then and I still have to occasional cigarette (5 beers is apparently the breaking point for me but I only drink a few times a year).  \u000a\u000aIt took me getting on to something a little stronger than the Blue cigarette/evod type battery ecigs before they delivered enough nicotine for me so you may need something a bit stronger than a Juul. \u000a\u000aYou are coughing because your lungs are intaking a foreign substance, the same as when you smoked.  As they get used to it you'll cough less.

aVQuestion about using my 18650 charger to charge other things (it has an output usb).\u000a\u000aIve been getting out of the big vape game and have moved onto a juul for stealth and discretion and ease of carry etc.\u000a\u000aSo I have a 2 bay efest charger with usb output, and a pair of 3000mah batteries. Would it be safe to keep the charger bay with the batteries in my jacket pocket (OR in a backpack) or would that be a hazard? \u000a\u000aI want to use it to charge my juul and phone when I go out\u000a\u000aAnd is using it as an output in general a hazard? \u000a\u000aThanks, i dont know much about battery tech and I know my vape friends here probably know more.\u000a\u000athis is the charger for reference https://www.amazon.com/Efest-LUC-Multi-function-Smart-Charger/dp/B016Q2XJ4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8

aVJust found out my GF is pregnant and I need some help from this community!\u000a\u000aI am a pack (at least) a day smoker. Obviously that needs to end ASAP. Looking to vaping as a replacement till I can get off nicotine all together. I need options for my current situation:\u000a\u000a1. Id like something that hits similar to a cigarette. I am fully addicted to cigarettes, mentally and physically. One of the things I most enjoy is the smoke hitting the back of my throat\u000a2. Something good that isn\u2019t too expensive to keep up with. Got a baby coming. \u000a3. Nothing that has those ingredients that can potentially cause \u201cpopcorn lung.\u201d (Clean juice that the makers are honest of its ingredients)\u000a4. Preferably something that I can obtain quickly. \u000a\u000aI am struggling big time so any help you can give this beginner would be appreciated. Thanks. \u000a\u000aEDIT: Juul seems to be the favorite in my situation. I wonder about the salts and Benzoic acid and if that can cause any issues? Are both of these things already in traditional cigarettes? (I read some guy was bronchial after using them.)\u000a\u000aEDIT 2: Benzoic Acid is used as a food preservative. Not sure I wanna Vape that. I think it might be in cigarettes though so maybe in the beginning it\u2019s no big deal. \u000a\u000aEDIT 3: I\u2019ve been smoking for 17 years. Pack a day.

aVPeople will tell you Juul, but that's a $40 device and each pod runs you $5... You will run through two of those a day as you transition. You can refill their pods with your own juice, but the Juul battery does not last long.\u000a\u000aI recommend the Boulder Rock over the Juul. Exponentially cheaper, function over form, better battery life, no bullshit proprietary charger, but performs similarly.\u000a\u000aThe device, along with a 30ml of juice (about 30 refills worth...) is $20 from Bombies. Get 40mg nic salt to start and a few extra pods. \u000a\u000ahttp://www.bombies.com/starterkit-ns-bombies\u000a\u000aGood luck!

aVNobody knows.i was a  Pack a day smoker too, but stopped with vaping and then switched to JUUL because I liked it better. I've been using the JUUL for a year with no side effects other than continuing the addiction. It's potent, so keep that in mind if you want to quit.
p515
aVThe nic salts are actually found in tobacco, that\u2019s why it\u2019s so potent when you vape. It will definitely cover the nic addiction when you are quitting. Don\u2019t know about the acid. Just be wary about the juul, it can end up being as expensive as smoking. I was using one juul pod daily which is the price of a pack a day. Switched to a device similar but wasn\u2019t a pod system. Now it\u2019s cheap as hell. I can link you but the juul is def your best bet for starting off.

aVI'm gonna tell you now man, the majority of vapes aren't a manual cig with a button. But if you want to get into vaping real quick and real easy, get a juul. They use disposable pods, and are probably one of the easiest to use vapes out there.
p521
aVI personally don't own the pulse but I have used it a good amount. I like pulse more than any other pod system (myjet, juul, phix, etc.) But I personally prefer the mi-one just because I rather fill with my own juice. I don't have any cons other than because of its size the coil is easy to flood. If you do like pod systems however, mi-one has developed their own pods so I recommend you check those out!
p522
aVStarted smoking again...\u000a\u000aSo i quit smoking about 4 months ago started vaping but the past few weeks have been pretty shitty and vaping wasn't scratching that itch so I picked up the cigs again I still vape more than I smoke but I want to quit smoking once and for all. Any tips? Been thinking about picking up a juul or a similar device and kicking the nic up to 12 or 18, but any suggestions are welcome!
p523
aVYe I can't reccomend a juul or phix enough they are both good.

aVTotal noob question so don't kill me haha\u000a\u000aI just started vaping because I just got a new apartment and can not smoke in it. I have been cigarette free for a little over a week now and love it. I started with the JUUL because some friends at work had them and it was simple. I liked it but wanted more flavors so stopped at a shop today and the guy talked me into a Breeze vape kit. I feel like he may have gotten the better of me because I know nothing but he wasn't so bad haha. The real question is I am kind of confused how to actually "vape" this thing. Am I supposed to use it like a cigarette where I pull it into my mouth then inhale or just inhale direct to my lungs. I realize it is probably my preference but was just wondering how other people use it. Thanks
p530
aVIf you want something with a tighter draw like a cigarette there are plenty of ultra portable kits out there like the Juul. All of my friends got Juuls but they're replacement pods are in high demand where I live so we moved over to the Suorin Air and I've been loving it! Easy to fill with just and extremely small
p531
aVThe nautilus 2 tanks seriously surprised me. I have the 0.7 ohm coil in with 45mg mr salt e. Beats my icare and juul. Enjoying the early morning buzzes again!
p532
aVwhat's the best small vape that can still take high vg and produce big clouds? Juul and i care are cool but i'm not into vaping for the nic, i just enjoy those thick clouds you can make\u000a\u000a
p533
aVI like it so far. Very minimum spit back although it does happen occasionally, normally right after refill but it stops if you let it sit for a few minutes. I use 45mg juice right now because I'm coming down off of the juul. 
p534
aVI've tried both Mr Salte in 45mg and the Saltnic 25mg and and get a near identical throat hit to the juul with Saltnic brand. I was using one Juul Pod per day and got too expensive.
p535
aVAll these devices have some sort of issue. With the Suorin I felt that it was the most consistent device next to the Juul. I've been vaping subohm tanks and mods for close to 4 years now and lately I've been leaving my Mod at home when I go out. I'm confident that a full charge and a full tank in the suorin will last me the evening when going out.
p536
aVGet a phix or a juul for those cravings.\u000a\u000aIt uses 50mg nicotine salts so it feels exactly like a cigarette I haven't even used my mod in a few days
p537
aVAhhhh spirit blacks. That's what I smoked. Would roll my own. Fucking awful for me but tasty. \u000a\u000a\u000aI'd recommend picking up something like a Juul or picking up an Aspire Breeze and running some 24 nic juice. \u000a\u000aWith a vape there are two styles of inhaling MTL and DTL. MTL or mouth to lung refers to using it similarity to a cigarette, and you will want at least 24mg if you are using it that way, especially if you were smoking spirit blacks. DTL refers to a smoking it like a bong, and in that case I'd get 6-9mg if I were you. 
p538
aVBuy a juul starter pack.
p539
aVBest vape with similar form to JUUL but an open system.\u000a\u000aI want a vape that will easily fit into my pocket, but I want an open system as I have a bottle of juice that I would like to use. Any recommendations?
p540
aVIt is not shaped like a cig but I have really been liking the eleaf icare.  Has adjustable airflow and can do a  really restricted mouth to lung or a direct to lung hit. Put nicotine salt based high nic tobacco flavored liquid in it and it really helps to get me over the craving then I go back to my tank.  There are a lot out there like it I have heard really good things about the juul.\u000a\u000aBasically look up pod based systems.  They will usually run higher ohm coils and have really small air ways.\u000a\u000aAnother option is mtl tanks as others have said.  There are a few new ones on the market that look good but I cannot comment on any of them.

Started with the Juul, got a smok XPro m65 from my sister-in-law and now I've got a smok stick 22. I'm gonna have quite a bit of cash here soon and it's time for an upgrade. I have been looking at the Loch Ness by Envii and the Voopoo drag. As for RDA/rdta I have no clue where to begin. Any more experienced vapers have any advice or suggestions?
p546
aVugh i have the phix, its way worse than the juul, but my juul got stolen XD\u000a
p547
aVHonestly if you're looking for a stealth vape and still want the nicotine I would go for a juul. I love my juul, gives a great buzz and lasts for a while, little vapor production too great for stealth. The only downside is constantly buying pods for the juul \u000a
p548
aVI second the juul. You can refill the pods with whatever juice you want. I sometimes use mr salt e 45 nic and it works perfectly.
p549
aVComplete noob here, know nothing about mods, so my local shop recommended this (Nano micro kit by Apollo) since I needed something small, and a juul has too much nicotine for me. \u000a\u000a\u000aAny tips and things I should know? When I say I'm a noob, I mean I don't even know how often I should change the coils and wicks. Can I carry it in my pocket normally? 
p550
aVYeah. I have a couple friends who can help, I just didn't want to get hooked on juul like everyone I know, it's way too costly. 
p551
aVIf you are indeed being serious, I suggest getting rid of all of your vape gear and sticking with a Juul or disposable e-cig

Pico + Nautilus 2 is great for cigarette similarity, Pico + Super Tank Mini is great for more vapor. \u000a\u000aDual battery the Battlestar or Charon are solid choices. VooPoo Drag also. Then a Clieto Exo, Crown 3, or Super Tank Mini. \u000a\u000aOr if you want something that an AIO (all in one) device, I'd recommend the Ego AIO or Aspire Breeze. \u000a\u000aIf you want something that'll get you a strong nicotine fix and be discrete, the Juul is a great choice. 
p556
aVRegardless of your needs, I still highly recommended that pulse stick. It's like a juul but refillable and heck, don't we all need a stealthy stick for those ninja vape occasions? Plus, 25 bucks doesn't sound bad at all. Good luck on convincing your wife mate.

aVBoulder Rock - My opinions + experience so far.\u000a\u000aSo I was smoking a pack biweekly for a year, and for the last year I smoked a pack a week. Lately it's been a pack every few days, even worse, it's been mostly unfiltered's lately. I decided it was time for me to finally cut back and eventually quit last week, so I stopped by my local vape shop after work. I've had my eyes on a Juul for a while, but the price is just too expensive for me. When I asked what other alternatives I had to a Juul the owner showed me this beauty: the Boulder Rock.\u000a\u000aLet me start by saying I've never really been too intrigued by vaping. I don't really like the sight of people blowing huge tornados everywhere, especially public. However, this little thing could definitely be enjoyable enough to be a pretty sizable substitute for my cigarette usage. \u000a\u000aThe things I like so far:\u000a- Flavor. For the dirt cheap price ($15 I think I paid?), this baby has great flavor. This is a huge plus for me, because every experience I've had with vaping/e-cigarettes the flavor was just plain awful and almost always burnt. \u000a- The pods they use. It's almost hard to call this a pod vape, because technically you can actually rebuild the coil/wick. I'm not that into vaping so I probably won't mess with it, but the possibility is there. The fact that you can keep refilling the pods up to 3-4 weeks (depending on usage) is a major benefit. Also the pods only cost $5 as opposed to Vuse, which is what I was using before, costing $10 for 2 (and only lasting me two days at most)! \u000a- Design. It's simplistic like the Juul, with only a mouthpiece, window for checking juice content, an indicator light, and a button. It's also flat like the Juul, which for whatever reason, is very appealing to me. To charge it, all you have to do is pull the bottom cap off to expose a male USB. \u000a\u000aThe only two gripes I have:\u000a- The juice that comes with it. When I bought it at the store, it came with a 1.8mg Tobacco flavor juice. Now I may be a little biased because I absolutely hate the taste of Tobacco vape flavor, but it was just horrible. I took a few drags and had to buy a 4.8mg Menthol flavor, which is far better.\u000a- The fact that it has a button. Even though this product is amazing, it still lacks the one thing that made me enjoy the Vuse (probably the only thing that made me enjoy the Vuse); not having a button. There's just something different about not having to press down a button in order to get vapor, it's almost as if it simulates smoking better. Call me crazy, but I really enjoy not having a button. Too small of a problem to really complain about though, as the benefits outweigh the negatives.\u000a\u000aOverall, I've gotta give this thing an 8.5/10. If they would sell the juice separate to knock off a few dollars and if it didn't have a button, it'd easily be a 10 in my book. Great flavor, consistency, simplicity, and super convenient; I really recommend this to anyone who vapes. Whether it's someone trying to cut back/quit cigarettes like me, a beginner, or even a seasoned vapor; this is a great device for on the go, every day use. \u000a\u000a[Pictures](https://imgur.com/gallery/M69f6)\u000a\u000a[Buy online](https://www.electrictobacconist.com/boulder-rock-vape-pen-p1294)

aVA warning about salt-based nicotine\u000a\u000aHello! I've recently seen a lot of hand-checks with Juuls and Suorin Airs. I work at a vape shop and have been working here for over a year now, and I've been interested in this industry for multiple years. I just thought I'd let everyone know in case some people *don't* know, the pods in the Juuls and salt-based nicotine in general could be harmful.\u000a\u000aThe nicotine in our house juice only goes up to 24mg in a 50/50 blend, but most, if not all, of these salt-based nicotines in the Juul pods are 50+ mg of nicotine. The juice we carry and the nicotine in it is as harmful to someone as caffeine is.\u000a\u000aThe only thing I'm personally really worried about is that these high milligrams of nicotine are highly addictive because you can be vaping at 58mg of nicotine and not feel it at all, but when you go to quit vaping or go to a lower nicotine, which is essentially the end plan for most people (get off of some sort of addiction). But if you are using these Juuls and high salt-based nicotine, you may end up picking up another addiction, nicotine.\u000a\u000aI've seen a lot of people come in this store and I've also seen multiple articles online that the high nicotine feels great because you can't even tell that you're on that high of a nicotine, but at the same time, once you go to put it down, you don't want to.\u000a\u000aI'm just as worried for people using these as I am for the industry as a whole. If this type of nicotine and getting addicted, this could potentially make a very bad name for the vaping community. It's something for the media to pick up. Similar situation for mods "blowing up". If people read into it and realized mods don't just spontaneously blow up and it's more of a *user* error, the name for vaping wouldn't be nearly as bad. But what can you do, the media is media and will always throw information out there, out-of-proportion.\u000a\u000aIn addition, the Juul pods are roughly $16 for 4 or 5, which can certainly rack up in price, quickly.\u000a\u000aI am definitely not here to tell you all what to do and what not to do, but I just felt like putting my opinion out there on these salt-based nicotines. They seem to be creating stronger addictions, and I've noticed myself that a lot of the younger generation have been picking these up, some of whom have never smoked at all. Therefore, they are creating addictions instead of getting rid of some.\u000a\u000aEdit:\u000a**TL;DR: This is just a personal opinion and observation. Keep an open mind and be knowledgeable about what you're putting into your system! Salt-based nicotine could be dangerous, and I would personally keep away from it.**

aVNic salts is different than nic in diy juice and everyday premium vape juice, it absorbs quicker and is intended for MTL vapers, not your normal DL sub-ohm tanks. It gives the small amount of vapor a more equal nicotine hit comparable to a cigarette. It is not intended for chain vaping, unless you are a chain smoker to begin with. Many people, like myself, aren't necessarily trying to quit the "act of smoking". I just wanted to save money and get rid of the stink. I use the Suorin Air and Icare mini with Mr. Salt-E 45mg nic salt. These are low wattage devices similar to the JUUL. They are Mouth to lung devices that only produce the amount of vapor a cigarette would, roughly. I use these primarily for work where I can't chain vape my everyday mod. They are great for that 5 min cig break during the day because they give me the nicotine effects of a cig, and I can wait an hour or two till the next break. At home, I use a mod with a restricted lung hit or MTL RTA burning around 25watts and I use the everyday nicotine that you all use, but that juice is only 12mg. That nicotine doesn't absorb as well as the nic salts and is very harsh at higher wattages, which is one reason DL vapers who use tanks like the tfv12 or Crown III only use 3mg nic, these people get their nic hit in the giant amount of clouds they suck in. If I tried using Mr Salt-E in a tfv12 and took that much cloud in, I'd probably pass out and get nic poisoning. It is your responsibility as a vape store associate to educate your customers. These devices are ment for MTL vaping for those who don't want to give up the "act of smoking", yet want to quit the stink. They are for people who have smoked 44 years at 2 to 3 packs a day and may want to ween them selves off nicotine but starting with a JUUL or Suorin for better success, keeping the "habit" as normal as possible. I've been cig free for 4 months after 44 years of stinkies. I love the act, I hate the stink. My 45mg nic gives me the same satisfaction as a cig did with the same amount of vapor as a cig. When I want more clouds, I reduce the nic. What I do see and don't like is high school kids buying JUUL to get that 5 min head rush from the high nic content. This will lead to the 44 year habit I've had. There are better things to get high on but obviously you can't tell them that.  So find out what your customers are trying to achieve. A long time smoker trying to quit will have better luck with higher nic content. If they want the cig experience then suggest a mtl tank with regular juice and 12mg nic. If they want to quit and also want DL type clouds, recommend 3 to 6mg nic. If they need the occasional cig break satisfaction then the Suorin Air, Icare / icare Mini or Vaporesso Aurora are great with nic salts.

aVI've seen kids (my neighbors) as young as in 8th grade using and hitting a juul. Do you find that surprising?\u000a\u000aBecause of this I'm actually interested in it but I feel that I can use it for a while then stop. \u000a\u000aThoughts?
p562
aVYou said it "What I do see and don't like is HS kids buying JUUL to get that 5 min head rush from the high nic content. "\u000aI'm seventeen  years old and want to try the juul because of the buzz feeling that I constantly hear about this light headness.   And I'm interested in it because it's seems much easier then buying cigarettes or buying we*d in that case. \u000aThoughts \u000a
p563
aVI hope no vape shop sell you or postman delivers you a JUUL cause you aren't old enough. Second, don't start smoking. I'm 23 and I got addicted in college and I wish I didn't. I know it's easier said than done...but if you must try it, borrow a friend. The moment you invest in one, you will feel like you need to use it constantly. \u000a\u000aStay away from smoking. Nicotine is addictive.

aVBroke my juul so decided to get a vape, the 0.5% nicotine juice doesn't give me nearly the effect the juul did, should I get the 1.2 or higher?\u000a\u000a
p568
aVGet a juice with nicotine salts. I use the Mr. Salt-E brand at 45mg/ml and that gives me a similar throat hit to the juul.

aVHow tight is it? Like, cigarette tight or juul? 
p570
aVAll in ones\u000a\u000aI currently you have the juul and the mi one but I was wondering between the mi one, icare, and suorin air which is the best MLT vape for salt nic (35-45). I tried my friend's suorin air last night and it's super smooth, the mi isn't bad either but does anyone know how the icare might compare?
p571
aVBeen vaping since about 2012! I started with an ego then upgraded to mechanicals and 200+ watt box mods! I forgot my mods at home while on vacation a few months back and bought a Juul and WOW! Nic salts and mouth to lung devices are definitely my preferred style of vaping now. Here\u2019s my selection!\u000a\u000a
p572
aVI was just gifted a juul from a fellow reddit vaper and gotta wait til next month to get some nic salts....any suggestions on decent and affordable brands or diy sellers?
p573
aVI would buy a few juul pod packs first. I like the mint and mango flavors the best! Then pick up some Mr salt e liquid or level up and refill your old pods with the flavors you bought! 
p574
aVLiterally had to be 0 nic, 100 mL in a day is nicotine poisoning levels. 100 ml of 3 nic=10ml of 30 nic=6ml of 50 nic which is the same nic as juul pods(53 nic technically but bear with me) and juul pods are .7 ml and equal to the amount of nicotine in a pack of cigarettes, now 6ml/.7ml per pod = 8.5 pods, which is equal to 8 and a half packs of cigarettes in one day which would surely land you in the hospital, and remember that is with the LOWEST POSSIBLE RETAIL NICOTINE LEVEL in vape juice.

p582
aVI'd *HIGHLY* recommend a phix or a juul for your father and maybe a vaporesso revenger for yourself.
p583
aVYe I'm talking about the juul and the phix specifically.\u000a\u000aThey are really similar to a cigarette and they both use 52mg with nicotine salts which means it's slot more like a cigarette throat hit/buzz and also they look really nice and are compact
p584
aVNic salt is made for those little aio pod type vape. I'm using 45mg Mr. Salt-E Strawberry Funnel cake in an ICare mini and a Suorin Air. It absorbs more/faster than regular nic so you only want 5 to 10 hits to get the equivalent nic of a cig, leaving you more satisfied and not meant for chain vaping. I use it for work where I can't chain vape, I take it outside for about 5 mins every hour and I'm good to go till the next hour or so. I use MTL tanks on my adv but only use 12 mg nic and need to constantly vape that with little break I between. Nic salt is no where near as harsh as say an 18 or 24mg of regular nic which to me is like swallowing razor blades, hence the 12mg regular nic.  NS gives a nice throat hit with little cig-like puffs and is why the JUUL is so popular.
p585
aVamerica, texas specifically. idk if it's just my town but in the bathroom at school today i saw 2 juuls, 3 suorin airs and about 5 or 6 junos. 
p586
aVthey're pretty much a cheaper juul. the pods are like 45mg nic so you can get buzzed off them in about 4 or so hits and they're small so they don't put out a lot of vapor. so basically what that means is just about everyone in my grade has one. 
p587

p591
aVThe MyJet is great and you can fill up the pods with your own juice. The juul is fantastic, but the pods are too expensive. I buy the salt based nic juice from level up vapor and it works very well. Hope this helps.
p592
aVWay better than the juul. Half the price and performs just as well. Not to mention you can use whatever juice you want unlike the juul which is limited to their overpriced pods.

aVI would be going with a juul or something like that and some nic salts juice. 
p601
aVI typically vape 12mg nic with 70/30 VG/PG or 65/35 depending on manufacturer. I also use MTL style vape. If you use a DL type tank like the babybeast so many people start with, the nic level is kept lower (typically 3mg) because of the amount of vapor you intake compared to MTL style.  If you want to reduce the number of hits per day, the better option might be to use nic salts like the juice found in the JUUL. That has a mg level of 45mg but tastes differently and absorbs differently than freebase nic in the typical juice. Four to 6 hits gives you enough nicotine to satisfy for a much longer period and is not recommended for DL devices at higher wattages. Nic salts are meant for JUUL like devices such as the ICare (and Icare mini), My Jet, Von Erl, and other AIO devices with low wattages and MTL or restricted direct lung draws.
p602
aVis there anything on the market currently that is similar in size to a juul but doesn't require pods (i.e. refillable?\u000a\u000asorry i'm a noob but thank you for the input

aVI don't have one so I can't say for certain, but I believe you can refill juul pods

p608
aVNeed help on which mod to get\u000a\u000a          Hey guys, pretty new to the vaping scene but I'm loving it so far and have been cigarette free since early July. I started with a crappy juul then borrowed a friends joybo dual 18650 and enjoyed t. I purchased a kabgertech cupti and am super unhappy with it now, I've gone through 4 atomizers in 9 days (I have to be doing something wrong). \u000a\u000a          Wondering what he best small box mods or there are. I'm looking for something that's gonna fit in my hand nicely (smok alien size is good) and that will continue to have nice flavor with the atomizers for more than two days. Thanks in advance for any advice guys! Dunno how much work goes into rba's but maybe I need to look into those?
p609
aVNice!!! If you're coming from smoking cigarettes I really recommend using a Juno or Juul they are cheap and reusable and have very high nicotine levels 
p610
aVI say use whatever keeps them from picking up the pack again. I'm not a fan of the capsule system of the juul personally but to each their own on the path
p611
aVApparently you can refill juul pods fairly easily.
p612
aVNeed some advice.\u000a\u000aI recently bought a juul which had 50mg of nicotine. I don't wanna spend 20$ on a pack of pods every two days so I'm looking for an alternative. I was thinking about getting the eleaf icare and using 45mg liquid with it. Any suggestions?
p613
aVFrom my understanding the Juul uses nic salts, rather than the usual nic extract in usual juices. I believe you'll want to use ~25mg juice rather than 45mg, something to do with the way it's absorbed...
p614
aVAgree with u/didumstrax, JUUL uses nic salts, it's not as harsh as the freebase nic in everyday juices and absorbs differently. Check out Bombies juices Afterdark line of juices, they use nic salts up to 30mg and from the descriptions of their flavors, seem amazing. Also check out Mr Salty juices. I have the iCare mini and it's pretty loose for a good MTL hit so I use it for restricted direct lung hits when I don't want to lug my main vape. If you go to regular everyday type juices and want good MTL hits, look at the Aspire Zelos with the Nautilus 2 tank. The Nautilus line of tanks give the best MTL hits imho, but stock up on coils and only use 12 to 18mg nic.
p615
aVThat's for all the input. The icare seems most like a juul but there are probably better options, like the zelos. The juul is pretty MTL imo. I have an istick pico rn but I don't like it as much as my minikin v2
p616
aVOooh! Check out the Vaporesso Aurora, looks like a Zippo and it does give a great MTL hit, has pass thru charging and coils last a good while. Great stealth vape. I prefer the MTL hit of that over the mini, but if the JUUL is similar to the icare's then go for it, they just came out with a slightly larger V2 of the iCare too.
p617
aVTell umoms to start increasing your allowance so you can afford Juul.
p618
aVJuul or vape mod?\u000a\u000aSo I see a lot of people talking about how good juul is, and how they raised the age to 21 (retarded) but I'm just wondering if you guys who have used juul before, and compare it to a vape mod, is it any better? I get it it's for people who like it keep it low key and smoke at their job but I'm more interested in the nicotine hits. Is juul stronger or is it weak compared to any other regular vape mod?
p619
aVJuul is more for smokers coming off cigs, so yes the hits are stronger, they use nic salt based eliquids in their pods which are usually around 50 mg or. something as apposed to a mod which you can Taylor to your own liking  
p620
aVAlso juul won't put out extremely big clouds.
p621
aVThat\u2019s all I wanted to know really, if I\u2019m 18 how am I able to buy juul? 
p622
aVI need some serious help!\u000a\u000aHello, I need some help regarding a juul, the 2 gold pins which connect the pod to the battery and read inhale, are stuck down. This means it doesn't read that I'm inhaling and does not produce ANY Vapor. Any thing is appreciated, Thanks!!
p623
aVNoob question\u000a\u000aHow does vaping compare to juuling? 
p624
aVWell a juul is a vape. It's mouth to lung like a cigarette, whereas a lot of people on this sub move to sub ohming which typically requires direct to lung hits and more power.
p625
aVAppreciate the response, Im guessing people In this group most likely prefer vaping to juuling. Is that because you can get more vapor equaling a stronger head rush?
p626
aVAppreciate the response, Im guessing people In this group most likely prefer vaping to juuling. Is that because you can get more vapor equaling a stronger head rush?
p627
aV"Juuling" IS vaping. I'm sure a ton of people here have a juul also jus to use while driving and stuff. \u000a\u000aYou're more likely to get more a headrush vaping a juul bc it contains more nicotine. But please don't tell me you're one of those kids that picked up a juul jus to get "high" off of the nicotine rush. 
p628
aVAs someone who started (and quit cigs) with a juul and moved on to sub-ohm vaping, there is definitely a difference. While the Juul hits harder with a nicotine buzz than any other I've tried, sub-ohm vaping definitely becomes cheaper in the long run and has such a huge variety of flavors it's unbelievable. Since I've switched, I don't think I've bought pods in at least 3 months
p629
aVJuul is what you're looking for, high nic and almost no vapor if you hold it in. That being said, you can't shoplift it, as they're really only found online\u000a
p630
aVThanks!\u000aIt was actually my friend that posted this lol but I've passed it on. Although his Bo seems to have a mind of its own right now, could be resorting to Juul.
p631
aVthe very popular pod system seems like it would fit you, maybe a bo or juul
p632
aVYeah I have a juul i use for stealth vaping but it just isn't the same as a good vape hit.
p633
aVA lower power MTL atty might work for you. If you play with your nic level, you can get a satisfying hit at like 20w that won't fog out the room, even with 70/30 juice. I like the Digiflavor Siren 22; it can go from a medium/loose MTL to a restricted DTL so it has a lot more flexibility than the Juul. 
p634
aV"rig" a juul pod?\u000a\u000a[deleted]
p635
aVBáton vs JUUL\u000a\u000aI have a Báton and am wondering what the differences are and which you think is better
p636
aVIf you want some serious motivation, think of what happened to your dad thankfully he survived cancer, I'm not sure if he smoked or not but if you don't kick the habit cancer is possibly down the road.  What I would highly recommend is a juul.  It's a mouth to lung device about the size of a USB sick with a strong throat hit and a massive buzz.  I would start by purchasing that, that will easily kill your nicotine cravings and you will probably never touch a cig again, they have 5 flavors: creme burlee, fruit, mint, mango and tobacco.  My person favorite is mango. If you buy the starter pack it comes with 1 of every pod except mango.  You can by more pods in packs of 4 on the juul website for $15, you can also get pods in gas stations for $20-$28.
p637
aVI know it's hard man, but trust me I really think the juul will work for you, good luck!
p638
aVHey man it's almost been a week, did you pick up a juul?  If so how's everything working out for you?
p639
aVHe's making a joke that 15 year olds all have Juuls now. It's actually become a huge problem at my old high school with kids constantly vaping in the bathrooms
p640
aVoooooh....thought it was an implication that the juul isn't a good device to use, cuz I've been considering getting one.
p641
aVjuul gang
p642
aVIt's only because juuls have become insanely popular among 15 yr olds, but you're still right lol
p643
aVIcare solo... bad luck or is it a dud mod?\u000a\u000aPicked up an icare solo today to replace my juul that kept breaking and got some delicious nic salt ejuice to go with it. \u000a\u000aFollowed all instructions for assembly like always and I've never had worse spitback. I've tried tilting the mod, using other coils, all the usual fixes but wow 45mg menthol is not great when it's boiling in your mouth.\u000a\u000aHas anyone with the solo had the same problems and fixed them? I had the original icare and never had spitback this bad.\u000a\u000aThanks guys,\u000aVape on!
p644
aVI just bought the aspire breeze. It's an all in one juul style mod that also has a button, if you prefer button fire over draw fire. \u000a\u000a\u000aI have enjoyed this thing so much. And I've used exclusively mechs for the last 10 months. 
p645
aVHow do they do on the power and juice consumption? \u000a\u000aI'm actually thinking of going with an even smaller setup (like an icare or a breeze) and even higher nic strength. \u000a\u000aI enjoy vaping but I'm addicted to nicotine... I see most people going down in nicotine but I seem to be going up. I hear the juul is nice but really expensive. \u000a\u000aIt's really strange, smoking cigs for 20+ years I would stick to pretty much one brand. With vaping I feel like I want to try everything. 
p646
aVMione or limitless pulse. Or even a juul if you dont mind buying their prefilled pods.
p647
aVWhen you can't find your Juul....
p648
aVif ur looking for something else compact and not too expensive i'd recommend a juul
p649
aVWhich vapes would you guys recommend?\u000a\u000aI was vaping with my friends Juul the other day and absolutely loved it, the design and everything. I was looking for the opinions of some more experienced vapers though if something like the Juul or the cheapest V2 EX starter kit are worth it. 
p650
aVIf you like the juul get it. There's so much choice and people here will tell you different things and some of that advice will be really good and some advice will be so fucking bullshit it might even harm you. My advice is go with something you've already tried and you know you  like. 
p651
aVFor what it's worth I'll recommend a few cheap and good alternatives to the juul. If you want to vape like you're smoking a cigarette check out the Innokin Endura T kit range. They've worked for a lot of people I know. If you want to get into sub-ohm cloud chasing I'd recommend a Innokin Coolfire IV kit or the Eleaf istick Power 80watt kit. These kits are relatively cheap, have good reviews and come with built in batteries so you don't have to mess around with external chargers or the expense of buying extra 18650s, which is a big plus in my view for someone just getting into vaping. 
p652
aVNo buzz off a juul\u000a\u000aSo I put my juul down for 6 months now and decided to pick it up again but after a week or so I still can't get a buzz I don't know what's wrong I used to take a break every other week and went through a pod a week what is wrong with me and what should I do?
p653
aVJuul help!\u000a\u000aWhen I insert my pod my juul does not light up and it does not hit. It does however light up when it charges. I have tried using a q-tip to clean it but that does not help either. Please help!!!
p654
aVI have had issues with my juul doing this. Try a new cartridge to see if it is just a defective cartridge. I had a defective cartridge one time.
p655
aVi just realized i said ileaf not icare, but yea i run an al85 and i cant really be blowing clouds in the factory but i might just do it its so cheap. I have a juul but those pods are so expensive i just cant do it. about how long do you get out of a coil on that thing?
p656
aVAh makes sense. I actually went with the 25mg. 45 scares the crap outta me just thinking about it. I understand it for something like the juul. But for anything but the juul it would be too much.
p657
aVIf you would like to have similar pull as a cigarette and a lot of nicotine I would recommend the [juul](https://www.juulvapor.com). It's a small stick that uses nic salts in pods to give you 50mg of nicotine. It hits very smooth with a throat hit and has very get downsides. It's a nice small kit that I believe would help you a lot.
p658
aVI tried the juul. I hated it. It felt like nothing it was like sucking on a straw. I need something with a stronger hit. 
p659
aVLook into nicotine salts ejuice, I've seen 48mg nicotine content and it's the type of juice in products like Vuse and JUUL. Not sure if you can find unflavored nicotine salt however.
p660
aVLook into maybe a closed loop system such as the juul or the limitless pulse. They use the nicotine salts that were talked about by someone else in this threat. The nicotine salts are a more highly concentrated structure of nicotine. Not just the mg/ml. It is absorbed into the bloodstream much faster and you actually get the same head rush that you do from a cigarette. It's a much smoother throat hit than a 50mg freebase version. You can order unflavored from nude nicotine if they ship to Australia. But definitely something to look into.
p661
aVI'd get the Ego AIO, Smok Stick V8, or a Juul. First two will hit with a bigger cloud and the Juul will hit like a cigarette. All solid beginner choices
p662
aVJuul was a huge let down\u000a\u000aI bought the Juul starter kit and a pack of Mango flavored cartridges yesterday. It ran me $100. I was hesitant to go for it but I read so many good reviews and my friends were all raving about how great the Juul was. \u000a\u000aThe Juul sucks! Half the time you can't even get a hit out of it. When you do get a hit it feels like nothing. The battery dies rather quickly. Yeah it looks sleek and it's small but it is a total waste. \u000a\u000aDO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE JUUL!
p663
aVprobably defective. contact juul and they'll send u a new one. they're the shit. you'll love it when it works properly.
p664
aVNeed dire help.\u000a\u000aNot sure if this is the right sub to post to or what, I've never really been into the whole vaping subculture. Anyways, I'm 18 years old and I've been smoking for 2 years. For the first year and a half maybe, I smoked socially - maybe 1-2 cigarettes a month. Once I graduated highschool though, I got laid off. This summer my cigarette consumption has increased exponentially, I now find myself buying a new pack every week. I've decided that I want to quit, & my mother is very supportive of my choice. Essentially, I need help finding the right e-cigarette. I've borrowed friend's vapes before, but they've always proven unsatisfactory. \u000a\u000aA few things I'm looking for:\u000a-**Rechargable, no cartridges**. This is probably the biggest thing I'm looking for. I'm already bleeding money already on cigarettes, I really don't want to be out buying cartridges every week.     \u000a-**Flavor**. I smoke Camel Blues & Camel Turkish Jades, so I really would only like a light tobacco flavor or a mint/menthol. \u000a-**Realism**. One of the few things that turned me off to my friend's full blown vapes was the look of them. I didn't feel satisfied taking drags from what essentially looked like a breathalyzer. I really would prefer an e-cigarette true to cigarettes themselves. \u000a\u000aA few things I'm not looking for:\u000a-**Actual "Vapes"**. As I said, I get no satisfaction from the high end model vapes, I prefer the look and feel of a real cigarette. \u000a-**Huge "Clouds"**. I would like to be very mindful and courteous towards my mother & family since they're letting me smoke in the house. \u000a-**Expensive E-Cigarettes/Cartridges**. I looked into the Juul, but the price of the e-cig itself plus cartridges is just too damn expensive. As I said before, I'm trying to find a job currently; so money's tight.\u000a\u000aAny pointers would be helpful. I hope you guys can help me here, really wanting to quit. Also, I'd really prefer brands that I can get locally rather than online.\u000a
p665
aVOr he can get a juul and buy a bottle of Mr salt E or level up salt juice and be way better off for less. 
p666
aVGet her a Juul or similar pod system device. Closest thing to hitting a real cig as you'll get I think
p667
aVThe Innokin Endura T18 or T20 I think would be a good choice, as would any mod that does at least 20W with a Nautilus mini. I got my friend, a smoker of 25 years to quit with the Nautilus mini. The Juul might be another one to check out, as would the Mi-one which Grimm Green swears is the best MTL vape he's ever had and I trust his judgement
p668
aVICare, Aurora, Breeze, JUUL, My Jet or My Von Erl are all auto fire e-cigs, just suck, no buttons
p669
aVLmao wow your totally right. I see it on the bottle now.\u000aSorry dude been up all night with my new born.\u000aI need to try me some nic salts for my 10 minute quick breaks at work! Get a JUUL with the refillable pods or something.
p670
aVJuul.  I quit smoking instantly with the juul and I was a pack and a half - 2 pack a day smoker for 15yrs.

aVSeconding this. Cigalikes are what initially got me off smokes. There's no beating the ease of use and psychological benefits (digital/oral fixation, etc). Most important thing is to make sure there's always a charged battery (meaning get two or more if needed), and pods on-hand or at least locally available.\u000a\u000aFWIW, here in NYC, there's definitely more Blu and Logic e-cig carts available in nearly every store (in fact it's surprising to find a drug store or decent bodega without them), but Juul pods are in every good smoke shop and of course any vape shop. So pod availability in your area should probably be one of your main concerns. Juul does provide an auto-ship option though.
p672
aVHaven't tried logic, but I know Blu are harsh as hell, and you always have to have a bottle of water with you or something to drink.  I never had that problem with Juul.  Juul just felt so much more natural.
p673
aVsmallest they come is cartridge based devices like the JUUL and the Phix by MLV.\u000a\u000athat being said, there are plenty of small all-in-one vapes that are great for concealment.\u000a\u000athe Eleaf Icare, Smok Vape pen 22, wismec MY JET\u000a\u000athis totally depends on preference.\u000a\u000aJUUL and PHIX both use high concentrations of Nicotine Salts, which have twice as much of a nicotine hit, just alot smoother than free base.\u000a\u000aDo a little research and find which one is best for you.

I have the Icare go. No where near enough throat hit for me.  And inconsistent build quality.  The juul gets raves but it's very expensive for what you get.  
p675
aVWhat about the juul? 
p676
aVI've tried to like the juul. Honestly. But it really hurts my lungs. I like a nice throat hit but it hits way down in my chest and I cough hard. After a day of vaping the Juul my lungs ache for days. Plus the only flavor I like is their tobacco. I still have one and use it as an emergency backup at work but I pay for it for a few days after. That and it's a bit pricey. 
p677
aVBack in May I got an iStick QC200W and it came with a baby beast that I couldn't get into because Direct Lung is not smoking. I found the Aspire Nautilus atomizer and it's helped me quit a 3 pack a day, 40+ year habit, the first time I've been without a cigarette for more then a day. It has a great cig like draw and coils are available just about everywhere around me, but @ $3 a piece most places, I was going through them pretty fast with all the sweet coil killing juices. I decided to search for good MTL attys and discovered a few but I wasn't willing to pay $150 for an atomizer so I found clones for $25. The first one was a Digiflavor Siren 25 RTA, this one isn't a clone but was still cheap and I could make my own coils and wick them. It's been great but the MTL draw just isn't there like the Nautilus but this is when I discovered I do like restricted DL hits. Then I found the Kayfun 5 clone and it too, isn't quite right for MTL hits out of the box but I can buy restrictive orifices if I want. It's pretty close but it's mainly restrictive DL. I have the Coppervape Skyline coming in the mail any day now and it comes with a couple orifices to help adjust for draw and I can buy a pack of 8 different ones to help dial it in better. I'm considering the Squape RTA but again it will be a clone because authentic is about $160 and made in Germany.\u000a\u000aI just started experimenting with Temp control using titanium and SS wire to make coils and while it's not a perfected technology, it's been interesting and saves the wicks and prevents dry hits if you get it right, so they say. I have noticed my wick is lasting about a day longer than wattage mode. Making coils is cheap cheap after the initial investment that a little over the cost of 3 packs of replacement coils. These MTL attys can work with some tinkering, which helps me keep busy too. \u000a\u000a\u000aAs for nic content, I've noticed that some vendors don't even carry 12mg, which is what I burn but I've heard you can find vendors online that sell something called Nicotine Salts e-juice that have very high nic content. The JUUL cigalike pods come with this it and people seem to say the JUUL is great for getting people off the cigs.
p678
aVIf you want to really kick cigs, I would recommend the juul 110% it's 50mg nic but they use nicotine salts so it's not as harsh, it's a pod system mouth to lung vape with a nice throat hit.

aVSame buzz as a juul from a vape?\u000a\u000aHey guys, I'm a noob at vaping and have some questions. Ive had experiences with the juul and Phix (don't know what the general consensus about those is on this subreddit) and they give me a really good buzz. I've never smoked cigarettes before. I recently picked up a SMOK Stick v8, and I'm just not getting a similar buzz. Is it possible? I'm using 3mg juice, which the guy at the store said was pretty high.\u000a\u000aThanks! Vape on!
p681
aVWell, the guy was an idiot. 3mg is the lowest you can go really. Try 9 or 6. That being said, the Juul hits like a train due to nicotine salts. 
p682
aV3mg is not high at all. Its a pretty normal standard. \u000a\u000aThe difference in the Juul is that it is 50mg of nic, but its a tighter hit. If you were to put 50mg in a Stick V8 you'd probably pass out, barf, get really high, or a mix of it all.\u000a\u000aYou can go to 6mg or higher, but you will get a harsher throat hit, and lose some of the flavor.\u000a\u000aIf you've never smoked cigs I'd advised against using Nic at all. If you want a buzz do something different.
p683
aVI use the juul sometimes when I go places and I don't want to take my big mod, some of their juices are legit worse than the throat hit off a 50nic juul it's insane
p684
aVIs a juul a good starter vape?\u000a\u000aLook i know there's problems with it but im just trying to get a decent discreet vape, i mean it does the job right?
p685
aVJuuls are very trendy among teenagers at the moment. I'm 19 and a bunch of my friends use juuls just for the head-high, and I have tried them many times. I have a vape and there is a huge difference between the two. Juuls are very harsh hitting, batteries don't last long, and the carts are expensive. Better off just spending an extra 20 bucks and getting a cheap starter mod like an eleaf pico.
p686
aVYeah ive used both and i know what a juul feels like, im close to getting either a juul or a smok nano one mod but idk its kind of better for the juul since its so descreet
p687
aVI suggest looking on YouTube and search for review shootouts. Search \u000aJUUL, my von erl, phix, Bo, cig-a-likes, Penguin, Aurora, iCare, Breeze. Others will also pop up as you watch. Personally, refillable ones I feel are the more economical option.
p688
aVYeah im probably just gonna get a juul
p689
aVWell it depends what you are aiming at. Considering that you want to keep it simple, nice and cheap then I would say to go for some AIO's. That way there is no hassle with batteries and such (wicking, wrapping and other stuff). You can also look into getting some easy devices like the juul. I've never used it, but read a lot threads here with positive respones.\u000a\u000aOtherwise you can just get a starter kit with a small mod. the AL85 for example. You can get some MTL tanks and pre-made coils. You'll probably get more flavour and more cloud production.
p690
aVJuul orange light blinking [HELP] OFFERING REWARD\u000a\u000a[removed]
p691
aVwow, I just looked that up because I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the Juul that was refillable. Dang the icare is affordable! Do you like it?
p692
aVYeah this is the first mod i've ever built in. and i bought the S/O the best starter kit my local store recommended. I previously used Pod systems such as the Juul and the Sourin Air but im having alot of fun with low-nic and good flavour juices in this first mod. \u000a\u000aSmall question, in the Serpent SMM are the included coils supposed to be such low ohms like .14?\u000a\u000aand Cheers. 
p693
aVNicotine most definitely suppresses hunger, but you shouldn't rely on it to lose weight. I got to into the habit with juuling too much and actually ended up losing some weight, mind you I didn't need to as I was already pretty thin. If you want to stop the snacking habit then I would say do 0 mg or 3 mg if you want a little bit of nicotine, but vaping shouldn't be used to stop eating.
p694
aVThanks for the heads up. I was planning on ditching it anyways and getting a juul or Phix instead. 
p695
aVAny recommendations?\u000a\u000aHi, I have a Juul and a iCare Mini, but I want to get an actual box mod. Are there any mods that are low maintenance? I see all these pictures of coils with confusing words and I get scared of buying a mod lol \u000aThanks in advance!
p696
aVStart with 6. If it seems too harsh or too much, go down to 3. If using a small device (1 ohm +, like the Icare, juul etc) then you will need like a 12mg or more juice.
p697
aVIt's gonna be kind of hard to say no starter kits since it's an all in one device.\u000a\u000a[The Smok Vape Pen 22](http://www.smoktech.com/kit/vape-pen-22) has a similar design, but a produces slightly more Vapor.\u000a\u000aIf you wanted to go even stealthier than that, I would recommend using nicotine salts in a [eleaf icare](http://www.eleafworld.com/icare/) or pod based devices like the [JUUL](https://www.juulvapor.com) and [Phix](http://www.majorleaguevapers.com/phix-starter-kit/).\u000a\u000aLet me know which one you like and I'll tell you about each and every one of them\u000a\u000a
p698
aVIt's a juul, mouth to lung pod system with a custom wrap.
p699
aVIf you think about it, people who vape 3nic but go through say 3 tfv12 tanks a day are actually taking in more nicotine than using the juul, the pods are only 0.7ml so you only take in about 40mg of nicotine over 3-5 days.  But people go through 45mg of nicotine a day with something like a tfv12, even at 3 nic.
p700
aVWhere do you get wraps for Juuls? I can't find any and I don't want to be scratching up the battery. 
p701
aVIt really does add up. You're more than fine I think. Honestly there probably is no such thing as too much juuling. It's probably all just my personal concern with how much I'm using and how much it's costing me. Trust me, it could be way worse and you are probably at a good place right now. Cutting back wont hurt but staying where you are at is fine too. Enjoy the juul man and remember everything is good in moderation.

aV[Question] LMC Pulse\u000a\u000aHey r/vaping, I'm a long time vaper and I want something small and discrete for work. I would go with the Juul but i dont want that much nic. So my choice was the Pulse for its refilable pods, but i was wondering, what blend of juice would work the best? I was thinking about ordering some Mt.Baker Vapor Hawk Sauce in 50/50 because i love menthol. Any recomendations are welcome but i gotta know which blend provides the best flavor/vaping experience off the Pulse. Thanks guys!

I  realized that I could make a ton of profit because I could fill over 130 juul pods or 75 phix pods and sell those for $10 to $20 a pop.. I already got a ton of people that want to help me sell all them I just don't know how to get all empty pods or if it'll even be remotely potent.

aVJuul cancellation?\u000a\u000a[deleted]
p708
aVIt's shit I know. The cravings come at weird points. I'd be lying if I told you I don't have cravings on a daily basis. I do. But the vaping helps kerb them and keep them Down too. \u000a\u000aI'd give it a go. And if you just want to try it I'd look at a pod based system first. Something like the JUUL or BO Pod system. 
p709
aVyou could start with a JUUL device, pretty straight forward and very similar to cigarettes, then work your way up to a box mod. 
p710
aVI've heard about JUUL that's the flash drive sizes pen correct ?\u000a
p711
aVMine was the 8th as well! Happy birthday buds. Also look into the Juul device OP if you like the Icare. Both are top notch ecigs. 
p712
aVI have both, my local shop started selling nicotine salt juices so you can get juul stength juice for the iCare, saves a ton of money on Juul pods
p713
aVGet a phix or a juul. I've been using my phix for quite some time now and see no reason to smoke anymore. It uses 50nic (5%). Can't say the pods are the cheapest things in the world though.  
p714
aVThe juul and the bo are some good choices if you want to replicate the draw and hit of a cigarette.
p715
aVHits way harder than the Juul feels better in hand and these "jelly" pods are the best salt flavor I have ever had. Pods are twice the size of juul pods as well.(I am comparing to the Juul because it is the only other salt nicotine pod system I have owned)
p716
aVIt's working pretty well for me and I had a pack a day habit, I still smoke a few cigs a day but this is helping. It feels way better in hand than the I are or Juul too and is way cheaper and more available than Juul. These jelly pods are fucking awesome too just as good as a premium eliquid that isn't salt based(obviously the flavor isn't as good as the flavor out of a nice tank or RDA.) Keep in mind that Juul pods are 5 % nic and these are 3.5, 3.5 is still equivelant to I believe 18 mg standard juice. I think it's just low enough that you get way better flavor than the jewel and high enough to keep cravings at Bay though.
p717
aVYeah it's a nice little system. The fact that people still pay extra to buy Juul cartridges when there are cheaper better alternatives out there is crazy(I am into sneakers though so I understand hype.
p718
aVyeah when people first started getting them in the states the nic salt pods weren't out here yet either so it got some mediocre reviews saying it wasn't as satisfying as the juul I think the standard non salt nic ones were kind of bad juice too, but now that were getting the salt ones they're starting to sell like crazy, I just ordered some mango ones hopefully Canada gets them soon at least you guys aren't run by a dangerously narcissistic madman though.
p719
aVWord, juuls are only us as well right? Juuls are pretty nice I think they're overrated though and part of the reason the pods are always sold out is because it's the cool vape to have for teenagers and vape stores really don't card often(around me at least)
p720
aVYeah no juul pods over here so no one really uses them, the Bo is nice but the pods have really horrible QC. i usually get 1 perfect one out of a pack of 4l3 the others either get cracked mouthpieces or have tight fits which screw with the airflow, but there isn't really anything in this price range that delivers the same thing.
p721
aVWe do have the pods in Canada now at VAPEVINE.  You can either call the store 519-915-VAPE or they will all be posted online @ vapevine.ca soon!   We are based in Windsor, Ontario but we ship across Canada every day.  We are impressed with this unit.  It has a little more airflow and flavour than the Limitless Pulse and the Juul....and the charging box system is just genius. 
p722
aVI prefer the Juul. You should try it
p723
aVYou should try the JUUL or the Joyetech Penguin, they're more satisfying and u can add ur own juice to the Penguin. One of the main reasons being that Big Tobacco is trying to destroy vaping and you're supporting Big Tobacco by using a Vuse, Blu, Mark Ten or Logic because they are all made by Big Tobacco companies.
p724
aVGet your mom to buy you a setup like Juul. VonEarl or something for out and about imo. I'll get downvoted. But you're 17. Not 12
p725
aVI've taken a hit of a JUUL device. It's something like 42mg nic and I was fine. I can barely hit 12mg nic without coughing up a storm. So while I'm not sure if the guy at the shops ratio is accurate, it makes sense.
p726
aVYeah that's pretty accurate. The way I see it is this. If you're using a 6mg juice and vaping 2 tanks a day while the tanks are 4mls then that means you're using 48mg of nicotine per day which is equal to about 2 packs of cigarettes. If you're using 30mg juice in something like a Nautilus mini or another MTL tank or pod system like the Breeze or Juul that uses 1-2ohm+ coils then ur only gonna go thru about 1-2mls a day cuz MTL tanks use much much less juice. So that means you're gonna get about 30-60mg of nicotine. I would recommend using 24mg juice in the Breeze cuz I think that would be closer to the 6mg DTL in terms of nicotine consumption. 
p727
aVSo maybe a juul or Bo would be good for you? Since you cheek it and then inhale
p728
aVHello, welcome to /r/vaping. I have a couple questions for you and I'll also address what you've already written.\u000a\u000aDo you already smoke or use nicotine products?\u000a\u000aWhat is your motivation to start vaping?\u000a\u000a&gt;I want one that looks like a standard vape kinda like this http://imgur.com/mKWFXrD or this http://imgur.com/uR3okrm i definitely prefer the first style tho.\u000a\u000aThe first style of vape is called a cigalike. They are a very old style of vape from when the industry first started, it's definitely not what we would call standard. You'll be spending just as much on those as you would the JUUL.\u000a\u000aThe second style of mod you posted is called Ego. They usually have a cartomizer in which the resistance does not go below 1 ohm. Depending where you live, your coils may be hard to find and you'll be ordering them online. This style is newer than the cigalike, but still old tech and definitely not the standard.\u000a\u000a&gt;i definitely dont want the vapes that are box shaped with the mouth piece bc theyre expensive and not my style. appreciate the help! \u000a\u000aWhile the shape of the vape is subjective to taste, the part about cost is just not true. You can get a more modern vape for the same price as some of the older models and you'll have an easier time finding coils.\u000a\u000a\u000a&gt;(this isnt as important, but it looks fun to blow huge clouds so bonus points  for that\u000a\u000aThis is completely contradictory to what the mods in your pictures could do. If you want to blow clouds you need a sub ohm tank. Not all sub ohm mods/tanks look like boxes. Here is somewhat of a compromise to what you're looking for aesthetically, price wise, and cloud wise.\u000a\u000a[Smok Stick](https://www.elementvape.com/smok-stick-v8-kit-pen-style-cloud-beast)\u000a\u000a[Eleaf I Just S](http://www.eleafworld.com/ijust-s/)\u000a\u000aIf blowing fat clouds still isn't really important, but still being able to get a decent cloud, you could try the [ICare mini](https://www.vapordna.com/Eleaf-iCare-Mini-PCC-Kit-All-In-One-System-p/icarem.htm) \u000a\u000aIf you have any other questions, let me know.\u000a\u000a\u000a
p729
aVYeah thanks, all my friends use the juul and i know u can't control the nicotine on that
p730
aVIf you're doing this to bond with friends you probably don't want to get the Smok stick, it's huge compared the the JUUL. If go for the ICare mini. It fits in the palm of your hand and you control what juice you vape.

aVMyJet Issues - Recs on a new Ultra-Portable Vape\u000a\u000aSo, I've been loving on the MyJet for about 4-5 months now. While pod prep and the product specific charger are what I consider to be the product's low points. Once I learned how to DIY re-wick the pods for multi-use I became a die-hard convert for this device.\u000a\u000aSadly, after month's of daily use, and a hundred plus recharges, I'm starting to suspect the device has reached some point of obsolescence. When I draw and then take my mouth off the intake, the coil continues to spark as if I was still drawing on it. The only way to stop it is to pull the pod out.\u000a\u000aCrazy thing is, once I put the pod back in, it lights up again as if I was inhaling. The only way I've gotten it to stop is to take the pod out and use a pen cap and depress one of the connectors to shut off the power before putting the pod back in.\u000a\u000aAnyone else run in to life longevity issues with their MyJet's? I worry that with leakage, over time it eventually gets around the seals to pollute the electronics.\u000a\u000aAs for replacements, so far I've been disappointed with contained coils devices. I bought an iCare Solo on the cheap to get me through the day, and while I like it, the flavor and throat hit just don't compare. Say what you will about those damn pods, but when it comes to flavor and throat hit, I just can't beat that RTA-style wick and coil. The JUUL and similar pre-filled pods don't appeal to me cause of flavor limitations and cheaper than average coil construction for DIY re-wicking, but if anyone has opinions on the following, I'd be grateful to hear them.\u000a\u000a[Twelve Juno](https://www.vapordna.com/Twelve-Juno-Ultra-Portable-Full-Kit-p/twljno.htm)\u000a\u000a[Black Market BO](https://www.vapordna.com/Black-Market-BO-One-Ultra-Portable-Pod-System-p/bmbops.htm) \u000a\u000a[Limitless Rock Pulse](https://www.vapordna.com/Limitless-Mod-Co-Ply-Rock-Pulse-Pod-System-p/lmcplc.htm)\u000a\u000a[MLV Phix Ceramic Wick](https://www.vapordna.com/MLV-Phix-Ceramic-Wick-Ultra-Portable-Kit-p/mlvphx.htm) While the ceramic coil probably negates DIY rebuilds, the novelty of it piques my interest. Love to hear from anyone who tried this one. \u000a\u000aThanks all!

aVAh i was actually gonna say maybe the Juul! its an okay device, not available here in the uk unfortunately and i hear the pods are very expensive, iof you want a vape like that i'd highly recommend the Eleaf ICare (:

p736
aVAlright thanks. If you know what a Juno or juul is it's very similar to that. 
p737
aVI don't have a phix but I do have a juul. What I did to fix it was clean it with a q tips and isopropyl alcohol. With the pin issue I'd probably try and press the pin down slightly and see if it moves. If it can try to move it until it is level with the other pin.
p738
aVYes that's what I did. Still stopped working. This is the worst pod mod system I've used. Get a juul and save yourself time and money 
p739
aVSave you money and get a juul there about 50$ it'll deffineitley satisfy your cravings
p740
aVGet something like the Juul.

aVEnvii fit is really nice and is much cheaper than the juul, and in my opinion 10 times better
p742
aVi might have vaped isopropyl rubbing alcohol\u000a\u000ai was cleaning my juul vape with isopropyl alcohol 71% then i dried it after and i took a hit but some of the rubbing alcohol was in the cracks so i think i inhaled it. I took 3 hits but i feel fine what do you think could happen from that?
p743
aVJUUL is the best answer here, it hits so close to a cig, it feels like smoking a cig but without the nastiness of a cig.  The second I picked up a Juul is the second I quit smoking almost 2packs a day for 15+ years, haven't had one since.
p744
aVAlso the cloud on the juul is comparable to that of a cigarette as well so its definitely not as hard on the lungs.
p745
aVDepending on what you like, Juul, Joyetech Penguin or Vaporesso Tarot Nank kit to get started. The most expensive of those is around $60
p746
aVGod, please ignore the people recommending fancy mods and sub ohm tanks. If he's quitting smoking and has for a long time you want a device that mimics a cigarette. Look up the Juul- it delivers nicotine extremely similar to a cig and is a great device.

aVXII Juno Smoke Glitch?\u000a\u000aI just wanted to point out a flaw/glitch/trick with the Juno. For those of you that don't know what the Juno is, it's basically a Juul just not as expensive, good looking, and powerful, like your ex-girlfriend. \u000aI'm not sure what causes this glitch but if you rip the Juno from the side of the USB for two seconds as hard as you can and then flip it around it will rip for 10 seconds continuously and as hard as possible. It's nice if you can take the 10 second rip of high nicotine straight to your lungs but I don't recommend it because even if you stop ripping it, it won't stop firing.\u000aAny idea why this happens? Let me know. 
p751
aVWere you looking for a device that has everything all together, or one that's more modular? The Juul is a great device, buying the pods for it can add up a bit but it's not that expensive. There's some other AIO (all in one) set ups that are good too. \u000a\u000aAs far as more heavy duty set up: Pico, Nautilus 2, and a Battery should put you under $75 if you want a full set up that'll last a long time. \u000a\u000aI'm assuming that it's a MTL (mouth to lung) device he wants, right?

I would love to bring some weed or tabs, but the smarter half of me isn't willing to try and take that risk. For that reason, I'd love to bring my vape. Now, it's not a box mod or anything, it's a Bo vaporizer. If you've never heard of it that wouldn't surprise me, but you're probably familiar with it's famous counterpart; the Juul. It's small, about the size of a USB. I was wondering if it would be possible to bring this on the plane ride so I could have it in Montana. In addition to that, I would also bring some E-salt to refill the pods and probably some extra pods too. Is all of this legal and safe to bring on a plane?? And would you also have to be 18 to bring all of this stuff on a plane? Thats not implying that I'm under 18, by the way. \u000a\u000aThanks,\u000aMax

aVeFusion Duo - but looking for a smaller mod.\u000a\u000aKayfun Mini V3 clone.  Can't remember off the top of my head the build I'm using at the moment but 26-28g kanthal around 2.0-2.5mm for 1.0-1.2ohms, 17W.  Any build in that range in the KFM seem to be pretty similar.\u000a\u000aThe KFM isn't my ideal atty though.  I'd really like to see a nice compact MTL RTA.  Something Serpent Mini sized, 22mm and only 30-40mm tall.  There are a few out there (Pico, Doggy Style etc) but they all seem to have plastic tanks - as my favourite MTL juice has banana those aren't really suitable.  If anyone has seen anything please let me know.\u000a\u000aDIY juice, usually a Nanner Bear clone, 12mg, 50/50.  I've started trying nic salts, (NudeNicotine's Signature) at 20mg.  I don't know if there's much advantage over freebase on my first mix with it - with regular MtL RTAs a least - maybe the Juul/iCare type devices are different.  Personally, I'm getting a little more throat/upper-lung hit, about the same nicotine 'buzz', but it's giving me some light acid reflux (normal for me if I've had too much nic).  Flavour does seem to 'pop' a little more with the salts over freebase though.
p755
aVI just got a juul and it is very good at soothing those cravings. 
p756
aVIf I were you I'd check out the Juul or the iCare.\u000a\u000aMaybe that is what you really need. Totally easy to use, high nicotine and low vapor. Just like a cigarette.

aVJuul is awesome, but kind of pricey. Elevator I care also great but very easy to break if dropped the right way. 
p760
aVJuul by pax. The pods can get pricey, but sounds like just what you need. 
p761
aVI did at first. \u000a\u000aThe JUUL is great in those situations. It really squashes even the drunk craving. 
p762
aVJuul?
p763
aVAgreed! Juul kicked all cig urges instantly for me.  From the second I first took it off the charger in January 2016 I've been completely cig free!
p764
aVOP doesn't know what you mean. He hasn't activated it yet. You have to keep ripping it hard, eventually the light will turn black as night and it'll be imbued with the power to Rip Fuggin Tits, the buzz will be so deep it'll let you see through time, and you'll be spewing massive clouds that don't dissipate. Ever. \u000a\u000aAlso ask /r/juul.
p765
aVIt's not the mod, Tanks are sub ohm. If you're interested in an above ohm tank, take a look at the Nautilus or Nautilus 2. Maybe an Eleaf iCare device or Vaporshark Minnow. Possibly something like a Juul, Von Erl, MyJet.
p766
aVI carved a nicotine molecule on my juul bcuz I'm mole-cool
p767
aVthat's pretty cool\u000a\u000aalso, it seems crazy to me how old the juul is and nothing has come along that really compares to it. pods have grown more popular but there's nothing as compact or as fresh and innovative as the juul.
p768
aVI don't think these are shitty at all. I've tried plenty of devices and still have some but this is the way I vape. I love the flavor of these, the nicotine satisfaction, and the simplicity. I quit smoking with no problem using blus and never really needed much more. That's just me though, it's what I enjoy. I don't see how this is any different from the highly popular juul that's been trending for over a year now. The juul has good flavors and it satisfies with 50mg of nicotine. The beauty of this industry is that it gives you the choice to vape absolutely any fuckin way you want. I've had provaris, high wattage devices, genesis atomizers, sub ohm tanks, drippers, you name it, it's all good stuff and it's still fun to try different things but I just don't require a whole lot to stay off cigarettes 
p769
aVGood stuff man, go with what works for you. I'm picking up a Juul for work simply so I can get my fix without refilling in the morning, making sure I have a separate stash of 12mg+ juice, etc. :)
p770
aVLooking to purchase my girlfriend her first vape, need suggestions\u000a\u000aAs the title states, I'm looking to buy my girlfriend her first vape, she has been smoking cigarettes lately which I'm not really a fan of, she hits my vape every now and then, but she thinks it's too harsh. \u000aI have a cloud beast and usually run high wattage\u000aI was thinking about getting her something that puts out lower wattage, more of a portable vape, something easy to use, preferably something pink or purple that she would like. \u000aWas thinking about just giving her my Kanger 160W with a cleito but I feel like she would appreciate a new set up fresh out the box\u000aAny suggestions for something like that, that is fairly cheap? (broke college student) \u000aThanks for reading. \u000a\u000aEdit: was also considering a JUUL, I know she would enjoy the stealthiness but I think it's probably too high nic level for her \u000a\u000a\u000aTL;DR\u000a\u000aGirlfriend is smoking cigarettes, trying to get her to switch to vaping, looking for suggestions on a good starter vape
p771
aVI'm very suprised nobody has mentioned an Icare. Any of them. They are inexpensive to buy and upkeep. The only downside is the battery but if she only uses it as a cig replacement she should be fine. Personally I use the solo for when I'm at work. The clouds are small enough to where people don't really notice or care. I would use a 6 or 9 MG. Depending on how many she smokes a day. 3 just doesn't give much or any nic for me. Gives better flavor than the juul and has more flavor options because it uses standard juice. 
p772
aVI'm not familiar with the Juno (or JUUL?) so I can't compare. The MTL hit is pretty loose out of the box because the intake isn't adjustable. I've hacked it by placing a piece of tape over the intake and poking a small hole to get that MTL restriction I'm use to from Stinkies. The unit itself is very sold, the body is aluminum and the tank is a tough plastic and the tanks are cheap, less than $3 each so I bought 3 extra tanks, each with 8.8ml of juice.
p773
aVHere's a good starter for you. http://www.vaporbeast.com/joyetech-atopack-penguin.html\u000a\u000aCheck out rip trippers on youtube. He's does a good job reviewing new devices.\u000a\u000aAnother good starter vape that's hits more like a cig is the juul. It's a pod system there are several others out like it now. \u000a\u000aIf you find something you like don't be afraid to ask. I'll help the best I can.
p774
aVMe and my wife got off smoking with cigalikes. We went with Greensmoke, but they have gone downhill since 2013. (Over charging for cartridges, and poor quality control with battery's) Juul seems to be the most recommended now, and they offer stronger nicotine compared to others. 
p775
aVYou looking to vape to kick cigs or do you want to get involved in the vape community ?\u000aBecause if you want to quit then juul will be good for you as it uses pods. If not use the smok V8 stick it comes with a big baby beast which puts out big clouds and you can upgrade when needed. 
p776
aVI would suggest getting a quick cigalike (juul, phix, cync, myjet, icare) with 25-50mg salt NIC juices.\u000a\u000aHits the cravings dead on when your really wanting to pick up a cancer stick
p777
aVTry the juul with the pods they are meant to be good for quitting then make your way up to more advanced set ups as you feel more comfortable and confident. Good luck, remember not to kick your self when you have a cig as as long as you're making progress it's working.
p778
aVIf you smoke get the Juul. If not then dont use nicotine imo, its pretty stupid and the buzz sucks ass. If you do use nicotine and dont smoke get 4-2mg. For a vape if you want to be conservative and get good flavour get the Spirals tank with a single 18650 battery mod, or just get the G80 kit as it comes with both. If you want clouds or dont care about efficency then get something like the Alien or Predator kits, i.e a dual or more battery mod with a high wattage tank.   Over a short time a tolerance to the amount of nic you use will develope and you will need more and more to get that buzz, or you will just get very neaseous trying to go that far. Nicotine in the freebase form like vaping is mainly believed to be as addictive as caffeine but the act of vaping and juices, ect. will really cause an addiction. I wouldnt do it if you never smoked period and at the least without nicotine if you do.
p779
aVIf you're looking to quit smoking, I highly recommend the Juul. It's a small  device that uses disposable pods. Really low maintenance and costs around $50 for a starter kit
p780
aVIf you want something small, convenient, doesn't weigh much, and a "pack" of cigarettes last you a day, the Juul.\u000a\u000aIf you want to seriously commit and make a large move, you can pick up actual mod kits that are nice to move on from smoking. I had the Juul and didn't like it personally. I had to buy the Alien starter kit to really get on with my life... 6 months off though. \u000a\u000aIt's worth stopping by getting a bigger one... Or even a Vaporesso Target Mini would be good for you. Small, convenient, and easy to work with. Good learners device too.
p781
aVLooks pretty similar to the Juul which I have, have you heard of it?
p782
aVyou should look up Mr Salt E to refill your pods it will save you tons and has a similar affect of a juul pod
p783
aVI got fruit+menthol and want to try a new flavor, do you also not get as much of a buzz from mr sale e juice then you do with regular juul pods?
p784
aVCheck out the juul by pax. If you don't want that much nicotine, you can also check out the myjet. 
p785
aVAnything that works to help you not smoke is the right setup.\u000aDoesnt matter if its a juul a 900 dollar stab wood mtl or a rx300 with a tfv12. 
p786
aVvape only malle, my von erl, juul, eleaf icare, Smoking vapor mi-one, all simple easy to sue stuff to get off smoking
p787
aVI would recommend a kangertech TOGO kit honestly. They are very easy to maintain and allow MTL hits with the higher ohm coils. \u000aA lot of people suggest the JUUL as well. It isn't a bad place to start but I would say skip straight to the TOGO. \u000a\u000aAs for juice you may need a higher amount of nicotine depending on how much they smoke daily and which coil for the TOGO you would use. 
p788
aVRDTAs can always leak. RDAs will leak if you overdrip and tilt. \u000a\u000aHonestly what I do, is when I take my "home" mod out of the house (instead of using my TOGO Mini or Juul), I bring a prebuilt tank. \u000a\u000aThe ones I use are Uwell D1 w/ 0.8 coils for crazy good flavor with subdued clouds, or the Melo 300 for big clouds (though the flavor does keep up really damn well). I also have a Crown III but not sure where it fits in here - thoroughly enjoying it though.\u000a\u000aIf you are looking for a tank that is really leak-proof, check out the Uwell D1. One of my all time favorites. It simply will not leak on you, and the 0.8 coils make everything delicious. :)
p789
aVTry looking into a JUUL by PAX. A lot of people use that to transition from smoking to vaping for a number of reasons. 1. It's very simple. You put the pod in, and you draw. That's it. When the pod is empty, you pull it out, and put a new one in. 2. It uses nicotine salts, opposed to freebase nicotine, which simulates a cigarette a lot better than most vapes. It also absorbs better, which will help kill those quick cravings. 3. It's relatively inexpensive. Hope this helps, and I wish the best of luck. 
p790
aVSo cigarettes have a bunch of added chemicals in them to increase absorption of nicotine. That's a big part of what makes them so bad for you. If you want something that's like a cigarette maybe try the juul, they added some sort of acid to the eliquid they use to make it more like a cigarette.
p791
aVThey sort of use nicotine salts but they add in benzoic acid to facilitate the conversion of nic salts to freebase because FREEBASE BREAKS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER FASTER. I am so sick of people propogating the myth that nic salts hit harder than freebase. It is scientifically proven to be false. The reason the juul hits hard is that it's FIFTY NINE milligram and they add benzoic acid to ensure uptake. I have nic salts and nic freebase that I use in diy and the freebase at 6 mg hits waaaay harder than the salts. The only benefit to salts is that they are smoother on throat hit. Sorry for the rant but I'm so tired of fighting misinformation on this matter. People hear the myth that "salts hit like a truck" and just swallow it whole without looking at all the SCIENTIFIC STUDIES that PROVE freebase is absorbed more readily than salts. That's why crack cocaine hits harder than cocaine hcl, and why it is so much more addictive.
p792
aVThis is the internet mate I have no other outlets and I will lecture when I want to. I wasn't so much directing it at you as I was trying to avoid the op reading your comment and thinking that nic salts are the reason that the juul hits like a cigarette. Cause they're not.
p793
aVGo to YouTube and do searches on the following aio units and see if one of these will satisfy your needs; Penguin AIO, Icare, Icare Mini, Juul, My Von Erl, Vertx Plus. These are all small units typically under $35, some are only $25. They're all rechargeable and most refillable. I've ordered the Icare Mini for my in the car use or temping out for a few hours. It comes with a charger and it's a small enough charger that I can put that in my pocket and use the charger as a spare battery as well if the main unit dies. It was only $25 with the charger. There is also a slightly larger Icare but it doesn't have the charger, just a USB cable so that may be good enough since it's a bigger battery than the mini. Good luck.
p794
aVWhy would you recommend a mech?\u000a\u000a\u000aHe's probably looking for a simpe regulated set up, maybe a juul, or smok stick, or joyetech ego AIO. or maybe something like a mi-one?
p795
aVWill I pass a nicotine test\u000a\u000aI haven't used my juul in 8 days. The week before that I used it once every three days. Will I pass on Friday?
p796
aVJuul or Phix?\u000a\u000aWhich do you guys prefer and why?
p797
aVI didn't like any of the Phix flavors. While I do like three of the JUUL flavors.
p798
aVjuul
p799
aVhow did you take the juno apart? im trying to get into the main battery compartment. Is it similar to the juul?
p800
aVI am new to vaping and am not familiar with the Juul. Here is a copy/paste from another reply. Sorry for the late reply.\u000a\u000a &gt; To disassemble the Juno, you are going to need a couple of things: 1) An eyeglass (extremely small) flat head screwdriver, or a pick that comes with an electronics repair tool kit, or a small pick. 2) A willingness to face the abyss of regret and embarrassment that has become your life. 3) A soldering iron and some flux core solder. First take out your Juno pod. Next, look at the bottom of the Juno where the mini usb port is. On the both sides of the battery casing, the short sides of the rectangle case, there are two small holes. These are where the plastic of the battery clip into the metal case. Once you've found these, reminisce about that dumb fucking thing you did that one time that made you that guy to that group of people. Now grab whatever version of a small metal yet sturdy thing you have as a tool and press into the hole at an upward angle, then while applying pressure try to get the plastic to unclip from the case on that side by pushing in and away from where the pods insert. So, into the small hole, like the hole where your belief that you would fall in love used to be, with the tool, push in and then down, like you push down the anger that you were not aborted, towards the mini usb port. (After a couple of times doing this, the plastic clips have disintegrated, but being able to pull the plastic battery and circuit board out makes it easier to clean.) Do the same on the other side. After alternating sides you should be able to get the plastic clips free to pull out of the metal case.\u000aOnce you do this, you have a battery, circuit board, or whatever the green part is, and the pins. You will see that the pins are soldered to the circuit board, the circuit board and battery is glued to the plastic, and the battery is wired to the mini usb port. The plastic casing around the area of the usb port comes off.\u000aI just dropped flux core solder onto the pins because I did not have access to replacement parts if I really fucked something up, you know...like my life, and fixed the problem as it was, the battery being able to make contact with the coil to vaporize the liquid in the pod. A smarter person i.e. anybody, may be able to rig something up a different way.
p801
aVLet my batterys die, now I'm on my juul and can only blow *sickly* cirrus clouds :(
p802
aVJust bought first vape (juul) couple questions\u000a\u000aAre there any mods I can do to the juul in order to one, get a thicker cloud and two to refill the pods with any e juice I want. I don't want to be limited to the nicotine content and flavor juul provides in their pods.
p803
aVIt's both. The Juul won't really be something you can use to get crazy clouds as it's a smaller less powerful device that uses higher nicotine strength to compensate. The reason more powerful devices use lower nicotine is because the amount of vapor that's produced is much much higher. The ejuice affects it but not as quite as much as the device itself. The Juul is a great vape but tbh if you're looking to chuck clouds it really isn't the device you want. 
p804
aVIf you're looking for something similar but better to the Juul, check out the eleaf icare 
p805
aVYou can bend out the prongs of the pod just a hair to get a better connection to the battery, gives a little bit better hit.  I started with the juul back in January 2016, have been cigarette free since my first hit of the juul, even though I have much more powerful devices and atomizers, the juul goes EVERYWHERE with me.  Love that little thing.
p806
aVThis is what worked to get my wife to quite cigs.\u000aGet a juul starter kit for your nicotine cravings. This will take care of the actual physical nic cravings after 2-4 puffs. Depends on how heavy a smoker you are. If youre still craving its in your head.\u000aAlso realize, that you ARE GOING TO COUGH for around 4-6 weeks.\u000aIf you will make up your mind to get through that, then the rest is cake.\u000aYou can pick up a subohm tank with low or no nicotine to cover the hand to mouth aspect.\u000aThe juul with its high nicotine pods is really the key to it.
p807
aVYou should look into the Juul and the Bo One. Everyone speaks very highly about the Juul, but it was impossible for me to find in Canada. I personally have a Bo One with the PCC, and can verify that it is a fantastic device. \u000a\u000awww.juulvapor.com\u000awww.bovaping.com\u000a\u000a
p808
aVI do not like the suggestions you have gotten so far. I think the best mod to start with is an Icare solo, with Mr. Salt-eliquid at 45 mg or a juul. I would go with the Icare solo if I were you. I have several and they are quite good, as they allow for small, mouth to lung hits, but have enough airflow that you can inhale directly to lung if you choose. The juul I have never used, but you can't reduce nicotine content of juice with the juul. The Icare solo is also dirt cheap, as are coils for it. Someone else recommended the myjet. I think that is a bad option. The pods are difficult to fill and especially difficult to refill, and you can only get tiny, unsatisfying hits from it (despite the fact that it tastes amazing). Someone else recommended a Battlestar or something. Don't get that for your mother for her first vape, that's an idiotic suggestion. It has way too many features and it's too big and clunky for a beginner who just wants to stop smoking, it's definitely a hobbyist mod. \u000a\u000aPlease trust me and get the Icare solo. You won't regret it. It's like 12 dollars, and if she likes that ok then maybe think about upgrading to a more expensive settup.
p809
aVMaybe you would enjoy a Juul or an iCare for work. They are supersmall and give a huge nicotine hit without much vapor. Very much like a cigarette.
p810
aVThe Juul will definitely make you feel like you are smoking.\u000aThe Juul cartridges are ejuice with 50mg/ml nicotine (yes, really that much).\u000a\u000aThey work great as cigarette replacements.\u000a\u000aMaybe you can try one somewhere before buying, they are really expensive.\u000a\u000aIf you want the clouds though, I probably would use an OBS engine tank. They are totally leak proof because of the top airflow and can carry huge coils. You must buot your own coils though. 
p811
aV[QUESTION] Is the Juul unhealthy?\u000a\u000a[deleted]
p812
aVSo just say i vape at 25 watts using 3mg nic, is this similar to vaping the Juul? I just can't see how getting a buzz from something so fast isn't unhealthy. I don't know if this is a real concern?
p813
aVNot even close. You're using a very low-nic setup. But it's all about how much you need to be satisfied. If you have to vape that 3mg all day to be satisfied, the juul might be helpful. If you take ten puffs and are set for a bit then a couple puffs will be more than enough. \u000a\u000aYou have to realize nicotine delivery is different for every product and you can't simply look at MG level, you have to look at everything surrounding it. 
p814
aVso what's the deal with the juul? is it worse than normal vaping?
p815
aVso what is the difference between normal vaping and using the juul, is that high nicotine really dangerous?
p816
aV3mg from a normal mod produces a lot of vapour which means you're\u200b inhaling more nicotine each time you take a hit.  \u000a   \u000a50mg from a juul produces a small amount of vapour, this means that the nicotine content has to be higher to reach a similar level.
p817
aVSo if u took like a super long hit from the juul vs a super long hit from a normal vape, the juul would be more unhealthy? 
p818
aVVuse Vibe vs Juul\u000a\u000atitle
p819
aVSneaky juul photobombing. Hahaha.\u000a\u000aI assume that's an auto return switch?
p820
aVJuul - ez pz pods
p821
aVI would say a phix or a juul but they both take pods\u000aTry the emili vape kit it is what I started with it works great there is an option to choose a button or non button 
p822
aVJuno vape not working\u000a\u000aHas anyone had problems with the new Juno, the newest version of the Juul. Ive had it for two days and It has started pulling by itself and now won't work at all.
p823
aVWho told you it has any relation whatsoever to the Juul?
p824
aVHere's what I did in the first 2 weeks I started:\u000aI used to smoke 2 packs of Marlboro lights a day so when I started vaping I was smoking at the same time, BUT, what I was doing is this. I used to light to the cigarette, take a drag, but I wouldn't inhale the smoke. That left a very bad taste in my mouth and with every cigarette I lighted and didn't inhale, I thought twice about the next one when I wanted it because the taste was disgusting. Out of 1 cigarette, I used to inhale maybe 1 or 2 puffs, BUT I would inhale it in the middle of the cigarette so when I get to the end I still have that nasty taste... You'd be surprised out disgusting the taste of cigarettes is when you don't inhale it. That's how I was able to transition into vaping.\u000a\u000aNow, if you have high nicotine cravings, id recommend starting with the Juul only for on reason. That little thing has 50% nicotine in 1 pod (to whoever wants to challenge me on this, FACT CHECK ME). If the Juul is not an option to you, id recommend starting with 18mg nicotine e-juices and slowly lower the dosage.\u000a\u000aHope it helps and if you have any questions feel free to msg me or reply here.
p825
aVNo. Not really. I kept one mod and two tanks. But since I started using the Juul, I feel like I do not need anything else. I refill my pods, throw it in the pocket and am good for the day. I don't have to worry about leaking. Or producing huge clouds that might piss someone off. I love this damn thing so much I own three. 
p826
aVThe juul is fantastic on a rainy day! Any of you guys have the juul?\u000a\u000a[deleted]
p827
aVIn my opinion the juul is for teenagers.

aVJuul or My Von Erl?\u000a\u000aSo, I've had a Juul for about a year now and last night I left it at the bar and it's gone now. Now I'm debating between getting another Juul, which i absolutely loved. (Pricey and hard t9 find mint pods though) or try the Von Erl. If anyone could givr mr some insight into it, does it hit hard enough and how are the mint flavors?
p829
aVHaha. Seriously though. I wanted a Juul but as I'm in Europe there was no point in forcing the issue. So I got myself a 'Bo' one and I'm happy with it. Some have said that it's the closest contender to the Juul. The nic percentage in no way near that of what you are used to with that device, however. But I'm a bit of a chain smoker so 16mg is plenty for me. Plus, refilling pods is pretty simple. As for menthol flavored e-juices, I don't like them so I can't comment on that. 
p830
aVYeah man the Juul is a solid device. Probably just going to stick with it.
p831
aVWhy not the MyJet? I like it much better than the Juul and the Von Erl. It's almost identical to the Von Erl in performance but the Von Erl has a slight delay when inhaling to activate which is annoying (to me). The negative to the MyJet is the proprietary charger, but you're used to that with the Juul. 
p832
aVMost powerful (watts) cig-a-like vape pod style?? JUUL, My Von Erl, Myjet, etc...\u000a\u000aWhat seems to be the most powerful of the vape pod style cigalike devices?? Seeing if anyone has had any experience trying these, I'm basically looking for the highest output watts with lowest ohm resistance coil for highest highest temperature. 
p833
aVUnfortunately too big, needs to be similar style to the ones listed above like the JUUL. I understand that none of them will have a lot of power by I'm still just trying to find the most "powerful" of them 
p834
aVJuul affecting my athleticism\u000a\u000aI recent started using the juul smoke about 75% of a pod everyday i wonder if it has any affect on me breathing wise felt a little out of breath lately wanted to know if the juul is the cause
p835
aVJUUL... simply the best little vape out there, instant nic satisfaction, stealth vapeable almost anywhere
p836
aVYou want a stealth mod or a regular mod? I also like my al85 with serpent mini RTA, but that's not a tenth as stealthy as one of my Icare solos. Throw some 50 mg juice in and you've  got stealth and nic hit. I also didn't say that the solo was the best, I just like mine. I like it waaaaay more than my myjet, despite the fact that the myjet has way better flavor. I also like it way more than my og icare, which had terrible spitback issues. I haven't tried the juul, but it is far more expensive and isn't made to take aftermarket juice, and I found the pod style of the myjet to be a pain in my ass, so I wouldn't drop double the money on the juul. The solo cost me literally 12 dollars too, so it's a damn bargain. Plus coils are like 3$ and some change for a 5 pack on fasttech. Don't be so quick to dismiss the solo, it just depends on if you want a stealth mod or a slightly more pocket friendly mod than the 2-4 battery mods with smok tanks that everybody seems to be into these days. 
p837
aVThe wismec my jet is discreet like the Juul but designed to be refillable (not just hackable). 
p838
aVCan always go with a pod system like limitless pulse, juul or von erl. Or something like the mi-one.
p839
aVIs the juul any good?
p840
aVWhich one is worse\u000a\u000aHey guys so I'm either buying a new mod or a Juul soon and either or is fine I want the Juul cuz of the nic and it's way more easy and convenient but I want a new box because I like getting technical with vaping with ohms and stuff, my question is which should I get and is the Juul worse for me because of all the nicotine then a regular mod with 6 from 45-100w
p841
aVWhy would the Juul be worse for you? Surely you only vape until your nic level is satisfied. \u000a\u000aIf anything, the other option would be worse because you have to use more juice to get the same nicotine. 
p842
aVFor someone looking to simply quit smoking, I would suggest devices like the Juul, Limitless Pulse, or even the iCare system or something along those lines. They're primarily draw activated, no buttons to push no adjustments to be made, just stick it on a charger, when it's done stick a flavor pod in or your preferred juice and just enjoy as needed. Plus they're a more wallet friendly alternative to picking up a couple cigarette packs on the regular. One mistake I've noticed a lot of local shops do is suggest a box mod and a crazy tank full of buttons and lights to people who come in for a simple alternative to cigarettes, it can be very intimidating and turn most people off of the entire idea. Sure it's become a hobby for some like myself but others just want to quit smoking for good. \u000a\u000aDefinitely consider looking online for affordable devices though, I'd suggest Element Vape as a starter if you're considering looking at the products I mentioned. I also wish you luck in quitting the cigarettes! You got this! 
p843
aVWell the fetish thing is weird bro, but what helped me was the JUUL because it felt like smoking a cigarette.  Haven't had a cigarette since Jan 2016, since the first time I took the JUUL off the charger.  I have all kinds of vape gear now, but I really thank that little bitty vape for me actually quitting smoking and staying quit.
p844
aVHow's the bo? I've been wanting a little mouth to lung and can't decide. I've been leaning towards the Juul. 
p845
aVCan't really say anything about the Juul as I've never tried it, but the bo is brilliant to grab for when you're out and about or just want something that isn't all clouds and direct lung! \u000a\u000aFlavours available are great and it charges in no time. 
p846
aVOTHERWISE GET THE JUUL THE LIQUA ONE IS TRASH
p847
aVWHY ARE YOU SCREAMING? AND WHY THE LIQUA ONE IS TRASH? I CANT BUY JUUL IN MY COUNTRY.
p848
aVPSA to new vapers\u000a\u000aYou're all just gonna start Juul'n anyway so you may as well start now.\u000a\u000aK\u000a\u000abye
p849
aVHey now, Juul was the only thing that got me to quit smoking instantly... still carry it with me everywhere, along side my mod.  One juul pod lasts me like a week now though because I only use it for super discrete vaping
p850
aVJesus christ!\u000a\u000aJust buy a Juul and be done with it 
p851
aVI like that they're marketed as refillable and are not just hacked to be refilled luke the Juul and shit. 
p852
aVI got one as soon as I could. Love the futuristic/sci-fi looks and couldn't wait for the release date. When I finally got it I was pretty disappointed. I think part of my problem was my juice, as well as wanting it to equal the Juul with mint pods. After fiddling with the pods, rebuilding,  rewicking, etc. I ordered some more pods and other flavors of salt juices. I've been using it solely for the past couple days though, while waiting for the new pods, and have been enjoying it.
p853
aVAnyone know the wattage of a juul?\u000a\u000a[deleted]
p854
aVThe pods more or less expensive than juul?
p855
aVJuul competitors?\u000a\u000aSo what are all the Jull competitors? Things like the MyJet, Cync, iCare mini, etc. What all is out there?
p856
aVThe Bo One is really good and almost exactly like a Juul. The draw is very tight on it, much like a cigarette. It also has an optional 1500 may PCC that is really nice and will charge your ecig for up to 5 days. \u000a\u000abovaping.com\u000a\u000ahttps://youtu.be/Tir7ZhG8FSM
p857
aVThey're obviously talking about little bitty vapes, like a juul which lasts almost a day... or those god awful Blu exits... but I have nothing else that can last that long...
p858
aVBlu is terrible, as are most all gas station cig-a-likes... EXCEPT for the JUUL... it's freaking amazing!!!!
p859
aVJuul is made by Pax, the herbal vaporizer people.  Try it, you will love it... so discrete, so fulfilling.
p860
aVJuul? Never used it but people seem to love it. Only downside people always mention is the expensive refills.\u000a\u000aThe Vaporshark Minnow also looks good and would probably be a bit cheaper in the long run by replacing coils and refilling it with a good juice (nic salts are popular in these things - dr salt e)
p861
aVJuul, perfect for a smoker trying to quit.  Has the same draw as a cigarette, no steep learning curve, feels like smoking a cigarette.  I was a pack and a half a day smoker for over 15yrs, and I quit instantly with the Juul in January 2016.  Haven't had a cigarette since.  I have much expanded my vape collection since, but the Juul is definitely one of the best ways to start.
p862
aVJuice similar to that of a juul but for a box?\u000a\u000aNeed to be reletively cheap
p863
aVYou'd probably have better success with a pod system like the juul, but that tank is a pretty good one to start with. Look into the aspire nautilus as well.
p864
aVWhats a good mouth to lung vape setup for a throat hit?\u000a\u000aIm not looking for a expensive or "longwhile" vape.  I do already have a setup but every once in awhile i want a little more kick in the back of the throat.  Is there a reliable cigarette type or some tank that people seem to like? was thinking about getting the Juul for this.  any help?
p865
aVIt's not nearly as bad for your lungs as smoking. I haven't noticed any negative effects, and I also don't get colds or bronchitis all the time like I did when I smoked a pack a day. If you do want to try vaping, I'd recommend something like the Juul. The higher nic is good for satisfying cravings, plus they're small and easy to use.
p866
aVEleafs are popular here on reddit but I have no personal experience with them. I have had a Juul, which is similar, in my opinion would works great. It's limited on their cartridges for flavors, but I think it would be good for you, being you'd not need it that often. \u000aMe personally now, I still use it to get my nicotine fix, however I have several mods and tanks and such because now it's sort of like a hobby for me. I've been getting into building coils, which is my favorite pass time when I don't play my Xbox. It might become something you might try, and might get good enough to start selling your own on reddit, like I hope I will be able to. (:

aVhonestly something like the JUUL or icare mini seems perfect

aVSeconding (thirding?) the Juul or iCare. Small, easy, less vapor to mess up your windows.
p870
aVYeah I vape like I smoked cigs. Went from like 7 years of marbs to about 8 months with juul. Got sick of dud pods and was spending over 120 a month on pods for the thing. Loved it but the constant defects and 0 response from customer support drove me to buy a real mod... thingy....\u000aI'm vaping now and the flavor is better.\u000aEdit: using the old juices I liked
p871
aVThe Juul is pretty discrete. I've been seeing folks with them a lot around Charlotte, especially in the vape shops I frequent. \u000aLink: https://www.juulvapor.com/\u000aHappy Vaping!
p872
aVJuul. They can be expensive if you vape constantly, but they're a little bigger than a thumb drive, they produce little vapor, and hey contain lots of nicotine that works very fast, because they use nicotine salts rather than freebase nicotine. 
p873
aVMod: iStick Pico 75W\u000a\u000aTank: Baby Beast w/ 0.4 ohm coil\u000a\u000aJuice: VistaVapors Apple watermelon 12mg\u000a\u000aOther: Juul w/ tobacco pods
p874
aVHappened to THREE buddies of mine, now half the squad only uses Juul. 
p875
aVJuuls are pretty expensive. If i were to use a cheap vape it'd be an icare. Juuls are like an upwards to 50 bucks with cartridges, thats only 10 bucks away from a new rx200, and even after that a cleto is like 20 bucks
p876
aVIt's a juul
p877
aVThat's the only real problem with them, IMO.  I have my nice full setup at home and even DIY my own juice which is cheap AF... but I love the portability and ease of use of the Juul.  (and the fact that it's actually an enjoyable experience to use).... so I 'm wasting money buying pods when I really don't need to.\u000a\u000aWhatever though...as long as I'm not smoking.

aVRanges $16-24 per pack of four pods depending on the area. Not hating on juuls but if you want something similar buy an iCare and purchase some mr salts e juice. It's the same formula of nicotine juul uses to achieve the very fast hard hitting buzz. Much cheaper in the long run...

aVDear Female That Stole My JUUL at The St. Patty's Parade\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000aI was being nice, and when you asked for my juul to use, I decided to let you. We were just about to get on the train to leave for home, so i figured why not? You hit it once, and then just as quickly as I handed it to you, you swiftly pocketed it, and tried to walk away. I would not let you leave however, and grabbed your arm and pulled you back. But you just kept trying to walk away. You then got the attention of a cop and told him that we were trying to push you into the tracks, which was not even remotely true. But he let you go and held us back. You where then lost in the mob of people boarding the septa and we never saw you again.\u000a\u000aGood luck using my Juul with a half battery charge and one Pod you cunt.
p889
aVThat sucks. \u000aBut stealing something to my face is a bit no-go. I'd have yanked the JUUL away from her and watched her attack me for it back. Then the cop comes and she realizes what a cunt she is and leaves.

p894
aVWrote a long comment, hope that at least one person reads it.\u000a\u000a&gt;First of all, vape devices use the same 18650 battery cell as laptops. Are you afraid of your precious MacBook exploding? Most of the incidents that you cherry-picked in this video happened mostly because of poor battery safety - shorting them by just throwing them in your pockets with keys and other conductive stuff, or using an unregulated device without any knowledge. If you use a good Samsung or LG cell, in a regulated (95% of the market) device and keep your spare batteries in a plastic case, you are safe. \u000a\u000a2) using Juul as the benchmark to all vapes is like using Renault Clio as a benchmark to all cars. \u000a\u000a3) FDA is a corrupt institution with a heavy lobby from both pharma and tobacco businesses to keep their very, very threatening competition, vaping, less relevant or even banned. I have much more trust in British government and NHS than I do in FDA.\u000a\u000a 4) "Cigarettes are a really low bar for 'healthy'". Anything that gets people off cigarettes is much better than smoking, and e-cigarettes are tools for quitting first.\u000a\u000a 5) Cool or not cool, that should not be a factor for an adult - leave caring what other people think of you in high school. Each smoker that doesn't switch to vaping because of this stigma is a person who has died of a preventable disease just because publications like you told him that it's 'uncool'. Overall, you didn't even present a single good point with reputable evidence on why vaping is dangerous or harmful, and I hope that nobody takes this video seriously.\ufeff
p895
aVThis. The juul is an excellent product for beginners, cheap, and seriously curbs cigarette cravings.
p896
aVOn the flip side JUUL got me quit for good after several mods eventually failed. Still hang on to my box mod for when I feel like vaping my face off because the JUUL is too harsh for that type of use. 
p897
aVHi OP...  I was a smoker for almost 31-years and totally quit tobacco 2-years ago via vaping.  When I was contemplating  making the switch, I was in exactly the same place you are.  \u000a\u000aFor what it's worth... after reading your post, here is what I would recommend:  \u000a\u000a*  Read.  Do some Google searches and read what you can about vaping to get your base of knowledge increased.  (I thought vaping was a "thing" for kids before I started!)  \u000a*  Research the following devices:  Juul, iCare, and myJet.  All three are small, relatively inexpensive, self-contained devices that will let you experience vaping with little fuss and minimal investment.  \u000a*  Once you decide on which device, order several different flavors of e-juice so you can experiment on which you like best.  Don't shy away from menthol or mint in the beginning.  All our palates are different, and you may find the "ticket" to keep you off cigarettes with a flavor you least expect to like.  \u000a\u000aThere can be a huge learning curve with the vast array of vaping devices on the market.  Don't let it overwhelm you in the beginning.  Just get a simple, easy to use device like the ones listed above and give it a try to see if you like it.  If you do like it, newer and better devices will follow.  \u000a\u000aFor what it's worth, I was hugely skeptical before I made the switch.  Like you, I had tried everything... and I mean everything to quit smoking.  But once I took my first vape hit from the beginner device I purchased 2-years ago... BAM...  I knew I could quit smoking via this technology.  \u000a\u000aI've since upgraded my devices 3-4 times, but the sensation remains... DAMN, this is SO much better than smoking!    \u000a\u000aGOOD LUCK!!!  
p898
aVJUUL users. It's such a small amount of vapor that the 50ml doesn't burn your throart. It's supposed to mimic a cigarette. It's also not meant for chain vaping.
p899
aVI'm a lurker former smoker. The Juul did it for me and I passed it along to a friend who also quit because of it. I have since gotten into the icare line and I love it. Wish you the best. It's an amazing feeling not having your hands smell like cigarettes and feel like your stuck. You will feel the difference in as little as a week vaping. 
p900
aVIt's 50mg, but it's made using a "nicotine salt", which is different from the free-base nicotine contained in most e-liquids.  It's meant for lower-powered MTL devices like the Juul or the iCare, and yes, the concentration is higher as well.\u000a\u000aIt allows for much better flavor without the harshness you usually get from higher nic juices.\u000a\u000aBut comparing the mg or % of nicotine in nic salt e-liquid to traditional e-liquid is a bit like comparing apples and oranges, it isn't a linear match.
p901
aVAnother vote here for the Juul, excellent place to start.\u000a\u000aMeets your needs as described above, and compared to most smaller "ciga-like" devices it's actually enjoyable to use and comparable to the "real thing".\u000a\u000aIt's a bit on the pricey side as far as Vape stuff goes, but it's still cheaper than real cigs, and once you've used the Juul for a while and comfortable with vaping (and NOT smoking), it will be much easier for you to branch out to other types of e-cigs that are cheaper to maintain on a daily basis.
p902
aVWas just about to comment on this. I owned a juul myself and I think you will be very happy with how easy it is to use.
p903
aVPretty much anything I have to say on the subject of where you should start has been said in the 40 other comments on here, but I just want to add another vote to the Juul/MyJet pool. I favor the MyJet personally because you can fill the pods with whatever juice you want (whereas the Juul is pre-filled) but since you said you'd be looking for something pre-filled, the Juul might be a better way for you to go. They're both pretty similar in other regards, very compact, tight draw, and juices like Fill My Pod (which are made for devices like the MyJet) carry a high enough nicotine content that it's still tremendously satisfying.\u000a\u000aOn the subject of quitting: there are a lot of people who were able to make the switch from cigarettes to vaping pretty much immediately. I wasn't one of those people, and most of my friends weren't either (with the exception of myself and one of my friends, everyone eventually quit smoking using the MyJet, so take that as another vote of confidence). In my personal opinion, part of the reason why vaping has been so effective in smoking cessation is because it handles more than just the physical addiction to nicotine: it also helps us overcome the mental addiction too. It takes care of the oral fixation and it's very enjoyable (as long as you're using a setup that satisfies your needs, whatever they may be). Other smoking cessation products on the market, like the patch or Chantix, can't do what vaping does. So that's a big plus.\u000a\u000aBut it's not a cigarette--you don't pull your pack out of your pocket and pull the cigarette out, hold it in your mouth and light it with your trusty Bic, it doesn't have the same smell or the same taste. Everyone is different when they quit smoking, but for me, these are STILL the things I miss the most about cigarettes and I STILL have the urge to smoke sometimes when I'm around it, and I've gone over a year without them. So if you're like me, you might have to find other ways aside from vaping to help you quit smoking. Cardio has actually helped me a lot, because it forces me to notice the fact that I don't have as much trouble breathing as I used to. So just keep that in mind. Be gentle with yourself, but firm. Keep track of the days you've gone without a cigarette, and be proud of it. Only smokers know how hard quitting smoking really is, and from one (ex) smoker to another (hopefully soon to be ex) smoker, best of luck!

aVDo what? Our forefathers used Juuls?. I make my own juice. It has Blueberry, pomegranite and koolada right now as my first comment says. I just had some ink on my desk and it was funny. 
p909
aVPhix by Mlv is closed loop system similar to juul but i heard really good things about it so i decided to test it out let me know if any of you guys are familiar with this device if so let me know what you think of it !
p910
aVRecommended closed system vapes? Give me your opinion!\u000a\u000a\u000aLooking into a bunch of different closed system vapes and I'm not sure which one to pick? So far I've looked into the ever famous JUUL and Icare. Juul looks cool but I don't know how I feel about the price of their pods and the icare is cheap so it has that going for it lol. \u000a Any other recommendations? 
p911
aVThere's going to be a ton of devices that will be releasing soon so you shouldn't worry about it.  What's current on the market are:\u000aJuul\u000aMyjet\u000aVon Erl\u000aPhix\u000aBo\u000aFITT\u000aThese are your options, my preference would be Juul, Myjets &amp; Von Erl.  I find these pretty easy to use, and delivery for all is great!  Von Erl &amp; Myjet is cost friendly so you don't have to spend much.  More money you save on a device so you can spend it on the liquid!  Research them to see which would best fit you. Spend sometime researching on liquid tho, I would definitely look into something with Nicotine Salt because it goes best with these devices.

aVI personally use the Juul and Myjet.\u000aThe Juul is small, convenient, and their nicotine delivery/satisfaction is great. I like the MyJet because the pods are readily available and I find them easy to fill with my favorite nic salt liquid.\u000aBut I have tried a lot of different devices.\u000aI had an icare but wasn't a huge fan because of spit back. \u000aThe Bo is a nice device but pods are hard to come by.\u000aVon Erl pods are a pain to rebuild and their standard flavors a not good in my opinion.\u000aThe Fitt by Envii is pretty solid. I think it holds the most liquid per pod and the pods were easy to refill, I haven't tried rebuilding one yet though.\u000aGood luck on your search  \u000a \u000a\u000a

aVJuul connection issue\u000a\u000aI've had my Juul for under a month now and I've been having issues keeping the pod making contact. I've cleaned my contacts on the pod and the device and I have to push it in and mess with it to get it to connect constantly.\u000aIs this a common issue and does anyone have any good troubleshooting? \u000a\u000aThanks guys!

aVicare is a nice little pocket vape. The vaporshark minnow is supposedly similar and better built though it's almost twice the price. I've heard good things about the von erl, it uses pods like the juul but they are easily refillable with whatever juice you want. Nic free juice should be easy to find most companies make it
p918
aVWhat are the dimensions of the juul? I can't find them listed anywhere...
p919
aV[Here](http://vaping360.com/juul-vapor-e-cigarette-review/) it shows it next to an ecigarette, and says it's 9cm long and 1.5cm wide.
p920
aVPHIX! Thought the Pax Juul was good? This thing is ten times better.\u000a\u000a[deleted]
p921
aVJuul is a fine product, just crazy expensive per pod!  But for stealth and a nic fix, it's fabulous.
p922
aVI've used an iPV3 and a juul, and I gotta say...\u000a\u000aThe juul makes me sees stars. Huge fan. I recommend you all invest in one, even if you got something else. It's so worth it. A lot of my friends charge them in our computer classes because they look like USBs. Good times. 
p923
aVI love the juul, it's what I quit smoking with.  I literally never touched another cig after the first hit off of my juul, and I was a pack and a half a day smoker.
p924
aVThere are also tiny devices such as the Juul and MyJet which you can't beat if you want a cigarette-like experience. So have a look at those as well.
p925
aVDoes that feel pretty similar to a juul?
p926
aVMy roommate has a Juul. The airflow is not as tight as the Juul's (haven't messed with my devices air flow control, its always been with all air flow holes open). I tried it before getting the iCare. I like the iCare's versatility. However, the Juul has a better throat hit due to the tighter draw. I haven't tried an awful lot of juices on my iCare, but the Juul's Creme Brulee is just awesome!
p927
aVJuul!\u000a\u000aSo I just picked up the juul, want to stop vaping completely as it became more of a hobby than an aid to stop smoking. Trade one thing for the other. Must be my addiction talking anywho I picked up the starter pack and I love it. It says 5% strength, does it go any higher than 5% 
p928
aVHey! \u000a\u000aI use the juul myself. I love it because the throat hit it give you feels just like a real cigarette and it does not produce too much vapor. \u000a\u000aUnfortunately 5% is the highest level for Juul.  5% nicotine breaks down to 50mg per fluid ounce. Juul actually has the strongest nicotine level in the market right now unless you feel like mixing your own juul pods(its hard, i tried..lol).  Also most ejuice lines that are sold in bottles cap off at 12mg(1.2%) or 18mg(1.8%) now.
p929
aVYeah when I first got my Juul, i was running through atleast one pod a day. Not many people tell you this when they sell it to you but 5 drags off of a juul is the nicotine equivalent to one cigarette. If you keep that in mind, that may help you taper down. It helped me. Cause most of the time I just hit the juul for the act of smoking

aVBoss found my vape cartridges???\u000a\u000aOk so I'm a nanny and have been for almost 2 years for a wonderful family. So tonight I put the kids to bed and then went to the bathroom and my boss got home as I was getting out. She notices that my stuff is all over the ground. Apparently while I was in the bathroom her dogs hopped on the table and pulled things out of my open purse and chewed stuff up on the floor. She picked up a couple lotto tickets I had and told me that the dogs chewed it up. She then picked up the wrapper for my JUUL e-cig cartridges. She asked "what's this?" And as I go to get it she looks at it and says "oh mint?" (They're mint flavored.) Afterwards I just don't say anything about it and we just continue our conversation. I'm so embarrassed!!! I don't want her to think anything less of me! I don't smoke any cigarettes or anything else. I keep thinking and I hope she doesn't think I'm not fit to be watching her kids :(\u000aMaybe she thought it was just gum? But thats kind of far fetched. I'm also embarrassed because of the dogs could get it, she probably thinks the kids could easily get it. I don't know what to do?? Should I bring it up or do you think I'm over reacting? My boyfriend says it's not really a big deal and she probably doesn't think much of it. She is not the kind of person to think too deeply on things so I'm not sure about the situation. I don't think she said anything about it because she was probably embarrassed for me or that she saw it in general. \u000aSIDE NOTE: WHY ARE THESE DOGS SO TERRIBLE?!
p932
aVAccidents happen. Some dogs suck. Its not like her kids got into your purse, which would be their bad (depending on age of course) Personally I would be honest. There is a lot f misinformation about vaping and I wouldn't want my boss to have bad info on something I do. I would make some tea or coffee and sit down and apologize, explain its a Juul, a vaporizer, and offer to openly answer any questions she might have about vaping.

p935
aVI love my Juul, the mint flavor is sooooooo satisfying.  I quit smoking instantly January 2016 with the juul, and graduated to bigger and better things, but the Juul still goes everywhere with me.
p936
aVYeah the flavor on the juul is subpar... except for mint it is exceptional. Not a lot of flavor, not too much mint, closest thing to a smoke I think I've ever had.
p937
aVThoughts on the juul?\u000a\u000aI've been on the relapse path lately, my h-priv has been on the fritz and I just haven't had the time to get new batteries. Looking around for alternatives, I stumbled upon the juul. The whole 'freebase nicotine' thing interests me, but I'm not sure if it actually makes a significant difference. Have y'all had any experience with it? I'd be interested to hear. 
p938
aVI hit a juul and I thought my larynx was going to explode.  Throat hit is massive.

p943
aVJust wanted to report back for anyone who finds this in the future.\u000a\u000aI bought a JUUL and it's great.  Does exactly what I asked for in the original post.\u000a\u000aI want to be open minded to new flavors,  and while I've gone as far as disassembling and rebuilding coils in a ProTank 3 (most people would call this too much of a PITA to justify), I'm not going to try and recoil a JUUL cart, and it's impossible to buy new ones, so\u000a\u000aI've purchased an eLeaf iCare and 2 bottles of 45mg Mr. Salt-e\u000a\u000aCustomer service for Mr. Salt-E was good, but the price is pretty steep.  (likely because it's one of the only nic salt products on the market)\u000a\u000aI will report back on how the iCare goes!
p944
aVThink I got the wrong vape, what should I get instead.\u000a\u000aRight now I have a juul by pax. Mainly because it's portable and it's hard to buy anything for a vape besides pods at my school. I'm 19, but my parents don't allow e cigs so I can't order juice, so buying at School is my only option. I'm mainly interested in lots of flavor, and I realized the juul is for people more set on nictoine buzz. I can easily sell my juul for a decent price and get something else or just keep it , so that's not a problem. Any suggestions? Thanks
p945
aVI mean, there are a few all in one devices that are virtually leak proof. Everything you need comes in the box, but you still need to buy liquid. The ego AiO box comes to mind, it literally could not be easier to use and is actually fairly easy on the juice so you don't refill often.\u000a\u000aOther than that I've seen some devices that come with flavor pods you just put in but they are mostly shit and seem over priced. \u000a\u000aActually there is the juul, I think it uses pods of some kind? I'm not sure on that one. It's also an AIO style device and quite small and easy to use. 
p946
aVIt'll be more expensive in the long run (cost of replacement pods vs refilling) but you can't get much more "no-nonsense, it just works" than a Juul by Pax.
p947
aVI went to Disney world and took a Juul with me, enough nic to curb the craving, so little vapor that no one knew I was doing it.  I just vaped away throughout the entire park, just had to hold it in and exhale very slowly.
p948
aVDitched my mod for a Juul handcheck
p949
aVThey are nice if you can get the pods. The Myjet is designed just like the juul but you have the option of filling the pods yourself.

aVDamn that all black icare looks the tits, I got the "green" or "cyan" or "Tiffany" colored one so I could ditch my Juul and those silly pods(gonna miss that Juul tho, the mint is sooooo good)
p952
aVI didn't get my parents to quit smoking but I originally got my girlfriend to quit smoking and start vaping by buying her a juul and now she has a limitless mech mod. She liked the "act" I guess of smoking a cigarette and the juul is the closet thing to an actual cigarette a vape can offer from what I know(don't take my word for that) but you should look it up and decided if it might help your parents. And goodluck to ya mate. 
p953
aVI have one word my friend. JUUL, it's the best ecig you can buy to quit cigs.
p954
aVIt's good! It is super tiny, so it's easy to stick in a pocket, and easy to hide in your hand if you're wanting to sneak a puff on campus/in class.  It is kinda noisy though, so that makes it a bit less stealthy.  Vapor production is good (but I'm not a cloud chaser, and only have a couple other mods to compare it to).\u000a\u000aI haven't used it exclusively yet, I have it as a different flavor along side my other mod...so I can't speak to how long the battery life is nor how long a juice fill will last.\u000a\u000aIt's incredibly easy to use, just draw and it vapes.  No buttons to push.  Without going to the Juul or a pen-style to get the cig shape, it is much closer to the experience of smoking a cig.  No buttons, just put it to your lips and draw, small and light, vapor production about the same as a cig.  It has a more restrictive air flow, so the draw is harder than say, my other mods, but is similar to pulling on a cig.
p955
aVLook up the "juul"\u000a\u000aThe guy in this video is pretty annoying, but he explains everything pretty well:\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NyXFxV6514
p956
aVThere's more too big clouds than being a fucking vape bro. We can help you get started here but you might want to work on your mindset a bit. I started with a setup similar to what I think you're looking for. I quickly found out that it wasn't enough of a throat hit to keep me off cigs. So I had to upgrade. That means bigger clouds. I'm really careful about where I vape in public for the same reasons you seem to be afraid of but at the end of the day I just laugh at anyone that gives me a hard time. Like sorry I found a healthier way to get my nicotine, would you rather me light up a tar stick? \u000a\u000aThat being said grab a couple juuls or an istick pico kit. Pm me if you have any questions. 
p957
aVThe iCare is kind of a cool device, but somewhat defeats the purpose of recreational vaping in my eyes. The iCare and several others (Juul, VonErl, etc.) were developed to deliver a highly concentrated nicotine salt solution to vapers who wanted to get a good hit without making big clouds (think movie theater or at work). The flavor won't be as good as other devices.\u000a\u000aI think that you would get more enjoyment out of something like a Kanger Subvod C or Aspire Pockex which will give better flavor and a bigger cloud, but not to the point of being obnoxious. These devices are meant for new vapers and fairly safe unless you do something really retarded with it. They will also provide a better battery life in my experience. 
p958
aVAny new juul flavors?\u000a\u000a[removed]
p959
aVI usually wake up in the night to take a leak, and I'll hit my juul a couple times before going back to sleep. When I wake for work at 4:30, I'll go downstairs and drink my tea, vape, check my news and social media, voop.
p960
aVI started with the Juul, the juul pods give a restrictive hit like a cigarette, and the nic content is through the roof such that a Juul pod = a pack of cigs and lasted about the same amount of time for me, about one a day maybe one and a half a day.  I then got a very basic mod and started at 18mg nic and worked my way down to 3mg over the course of a year.  But I will say this, I stopped smoking instantly with that Juul, from the moment I took it off the charger.  Good luck my friend.
p961
aVI wish the vape shop owners were a little more business savvy.  If customers like us see absurd markups, we walk out immediately with a bad taste in our mouth.  I doubt you expect to see your vape shop selling Naked for $15 to compete with online, but somewhere between $18 to $24 would be a lot more acceptable.\u000a\u000aI don't even go to local shops because I'm prejudiced their prices are going to be uncompetitive.  I bought some Juul pods at a vape shop without first asking the price. Turns out they were $19.99 per pack plus tax.  At a nearby gas station, I bought the same pods for less than $16, tax included.
p962
aVTo clarify, this type of juice was created for devices like the iCare, MyJet. Juul, etc where they use coils above 1 ohm. In those devices, the nic content has to much higher in order to have any real effect.

aVWhen I started vaping it took me another year or so to quit cigarettes, and it kind of started by accident (I had a bad cold and was too sick to buy another pack, so by the time I felt better I decided to just keep it rolling). Some people can quit cold turkey as soon as they pick up vaping, but for me and for a lot of people I know it takes a lot of effort.\u000a\u000aIn my experience, when I quit, there's no wiggle room. It's an addiction and I have to treat it as such. I've never been a social smoker, and a backup pack of cigarettes would be gone in less than a day, then I'd be going out to get another...you get the point. I can't let myself have one every now and then. It's like flipping a switch in my head, as soon as I have one, I'm right back in the thick of it. It might be the same for you--when you feel that weakness coming on, you can't gave. Rely more on your vape, but also, pick up other things to keep yourself busy. The first time I quit was years ago and I did it without vaping so I'd just chew a ton of gum because I'd never want to smoke a cigarette if my mouth felt minty fresh. Things like that, you know?\u000a\u000aYour setup is important too. I've heard really good things about the Juul (took a couple pulls off a friend's and I was surprised at how much like a real cigarette it felt, but it's been close to a year since I've had the real deal). I'm also a big fan of the iCare. Both of these things have pulls more similar to a cigarette and can deliver more nicotine if needed. Plus they're small and very easy to transport. I'm not saying you HAVE to get a new setup, it's just something to consider.\u000a\u000aAs for dental health, it's hard to say. I'm sure it's probably not as bad as cigarettes, but that doesn't mean it's harmless. There are a decent amount of sweeteners in some e-juices that I'm sure aren't good for your teeth overall. You can try to offset it by making sure you're flossing regularly and brushing your teeth at least twice a day. But also, keep in mind that you don't have to vape forever either. You can use it to quit smoking and then work on quitting vaping. There are no longterm studies that I'm aware of. Vaping is still a very new industry that's only gained momentum in the last few years, so it's going to be a while before anything like that comes out.
p967
aVJuul
p968
aVI canceled a big order for my Juul...and I received it anyways.
p969
aVI started vaping with a sub-ohm setup and quit smoking by way of using juice at 3mg nic. A few months ago I got a Juul and honestly barely touch my sub-ohm these days. Juul for life
p970
aVHow is the Juul? My friend wants to get one to quit cigs but apparently they only have super strong (15) nic 
p971
aVOh no, so I've been vaping for a couple years now. Got a few regulated mods and drippers and RTAs. Honestly, I like the discreet factor of the Juul. It truly is "stealth vaping."\u000a\u000aI'd rather not be blowing clouds when I'm out, you know? 
p972
aVI've been vaping since the summer of 2015 and have a few box mods, drippers, RTAs, all that. I even DIY my own juice.\u000a\u000aHowever, I don't want to be blowing clouds everywhere when I'm out. The Juul is absolutely amazing IMO because I can truly "stealth vape!"\u000a\u000aThe nicotine strength is actually 5%, so that comes out to about 59 mg/mL, not 15 mg/mL. Yes, it sounds absurdly high, and the first few hits off this thing will feel like you just sprinted a 5K. However, you get used to the hit and it feels absolutely satisfying.\u000a\u000aThe nicotine buzz is very pleasant, and a few bros from my fraternity that smoke claim this is the only alternative vape that would satisfy them enough to quit smoking. A handful of us vape at our house, so they've tried all the sub-ohm setups and all that!\u000a\u000aI have to give this my highest recommendation! I mean, I rebuild and even DIY juice to cut costs, yet I still buy these pods!
p973
aVWhat's your setup? I have other setups besides the Juul hahah!
p974
aVYes, and there's an even bigger difference between a $50 and $75 one.\u000a\u000aIf you're doing this, commit to it. You spend ~\u20ac100 in two months on cigarettes, that's now your budget. You can keep smoking and spend it in two months, or you can start vaping and spend it all upfront. With the possible benefit that you can lay it all down in two months (or less) and have that \u20ac30-50 all to yourself again. Or keep vaping and just buying Juice, which *should* be less (don't know anything about EU regulations, sorry). Or fail and pick up smoking again, of course, but if you spend money and are serious that's *much* less likely. \u000a\u000aThis will be hard and take work on your part but it's doable. I quit on a shitty cigalike (cigarette style vaporizer, do not recommend) after 23 years of smoking and it's been ~2.5 years off now. You can do it, with will and determination and the right gear.\u000a\u000aOn to that - I don't have many specific recommendations, but I do suggest (if you're looking to *quit*, and not just get into a separate, very enjoyable, hobby) that you look into "MTL" setups, and higher nicotine. Do they have the Juul where you live? Do you know anyone that has one? I wish that that had been around when I quit, consistent high nicotine (salt, vs. the standard solution most B&amp;Ms offer), pocketable, etc. If not, take a look at the Von Erl offerings, or maybe an iCare with high nicotine solution. Those should all be affordable options, if you shop around.
p975
aVGet the Juul, my friend. See you in a couple of days when you're smoke free.
p976
aVAlternative is the Eleaf icare, got one as my in-car/out and about. Pretty much like the juul but takes any eliquid instead of cartridges 
p977
aVGrab a juul for these exact occasions - that way you have a backup thats quite different, and as close to a cigarette as you can get. Basically, more gear is another line of defense. Cant get no satisfaction [from your mod while drinking]? Maybe this will leave you satisfied, its worth a try before another cigarette
p978
aVThis is not bad at all. Juuls are much higher Nic and "act" more like a smoke. 
p979
aVWent from a Juul to a Lost Vape Orion. Love the mod but nic seems a lot stronger!?\u000a\u000aHeyo. I got tired of paying an arm and a leg for Juul pods so I've joined the hype and snatched up a Lost Vape Orion DNA Go in all black and its a really nifty device as you all know!\u000a\u000aI got some 45mg Mr Salt-E Orange Mango Guava, loaded it up and waited 20 minutes... What the heck! - I'm buzzing hard and not in a good way. I know Juul pods output 50mg but this seems like an order of magnitude stronger. \u000a\u000aI went into escribe and brought my lowest setting down to 7/0 (from 11/5)... Still seems a bit strong.\u000a\u000aShould I just go for non salt? I am using 0.25ohm pods... the 0.50ohm pods have an issue getting stuck so I opted for the other ones at my local shop. 
p980
aVYeah thats probably the move. I am trying to dial down my consumption since the Juul which I felt was strong at first.
p981
aVWhat should I buy?\u000a\u000aSo basically I only have a Juul right now. I want to buy a box mod however that will produce good clouds and be able to give me a buzz. The max I\u2019m willing to spend would be around 30$ any suggestions? Thanks 
p982
aVThat's great brother. Congrats. My last cigarette was April. I did Juul from then till about October and now I can't see myself ever going back to cigarettes or Juul for that matter. Here's to us and everyone else who kicked smoking and is now vaping! 
p983
aVI actually started with a juul and it got too expensive. This was a good investment lol
p984
aVI just bought the Njoy ace and only found this thread talking about it. My first day with the pod was great and I thought I found a replacement for my Juul (they have stopped selling my flavors where I live) but after leaving my pod in my account overnight the next morning I ran into this burnt issue.\u000a\u000a\u000aThinking maybe there was just some gunk on the coil tried going for a few hits but it hadn't gotten any better. I know they use a ceramic coil in the Ace which was promising but I'm a little turned off since I still have a pretty substantial amount of fluid left. \u000a\u000a\u000aI did read on their FAQ that Njoy recommends storing the pods outside of the Ace with the rubber gromits placed back into the pod from when you first opened it. Could it maybe be that some of the fluid my be drying and clogging the intake to the coil allowing for not as much juice to contact and it's only noticeable when left alone for long periods of time? \u000a\u000a\u000aI'm going to try a fee more things and let everyone know what I find but not being able to leave your ace overnight and return to it is a big flaw if this is the issue. 
p985
aVyeah its rough, usually if you let a burned one sit upright for a day or two you can go back to it, but the price is still way way better than juul, so i keep buying them. ive gotten a pretty good feel for when they're about to burn and switch out the pods before they get bad and let em sit
p986
aVI hope you don\u2019t mind a newbie question.\u000a\u000aI smoke and I want to quit for several reasons but the biggest is the awful smell. Can anyone give me some idea of a decent - and decently priced - vape that I can easily hold in my hand?\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve read so much that I am confused. I thought about buying a Juul because they seem so simple but then I read that getting something I can refill on my own is a better choice. \u000a\u000aAny suggestions? Thank you for entertaining a beginners question. 
p987
aVGot one in my hands now I recommend the upgrade the mtl coils last a little over a week, it's so cheap, especially compared to juul, or other pod systems where you replace the entire pod
p988
aVGot this little bad boy yesterday originally coming from IQOS, Juul and the Mi-pod. Currently rocking the 0,25 Ohm Pod with 20mg Nicsalt on the high power setting after doing some tweaks in Escribe (boost/warmth set to 1) Used the 0,5 Ohm before and I wasnt able to notice any difference in flavor intensity, but with 0,25 noticably more clouds. Overall great taste and cloud production - couldn't be happier. Loving the design, too. Let's see how long the pods will last since I'm using a rather sweet nicsalt.

aVI\u2019ve been using the juul refillable pods with nkd100 salt 35mg and it\u2019s been great. Switched to the breeze 2 with the same juice and is really harsh. Thoughts? Quit smoking 5 weeks ago (pack a day)\u000a\u000a
p992
aVBreeze 2 fires at about twice the wattage as the juul.
p993
aVMaybe a suorin air, but I find that even that hits harder than my buddy\u2019s juul. Hell every refillable system I\u2019ve used hits harder than a juul. You get used to the added throat it
p994
aVJuul fires at about twice the wattage like the other guy said. Take shorter hits, go down in nicotine, or get used to it. Getting used to a harsher hit shouldn\u2019t take more than a few days at most. 
p995
aVBeginner to all of this\u000a\u000aSo I recently decided to pick up vaping because a couple of my college mates got me into it, I got a bunch of gift cards to buy one and some pods so my question is, can I use multiple payments on their juul website 
p996
aVYou might just be able to use one gift card per transaction.\u000a\u000aThe thing is, if you haven't been smoking, chewing, dipping or whatever, i reeeally wouldn't go into vaping. If you do, go with 0 mg nicotine. the stuff in Juul pods are pretty high in nicotine, so it'll be far too harsh for you, i think.\u000a\u000aalso there are probably better pod systems you can find. 
p997
aVDon\u2019t start vaping if you don\u2019t smoke or have a nicotine habit you\u2019re trying to quit. Especially a juul. If you insist on vaping anyway at least use 0mg juice. 
p998
aVThis is my story almost exactly.  I bought a Juul on a whim.  Didn't even blink an eye because in the past not ONE of these cig replacement devices ever worked.  It worked, and almost 4mos later I can honestly say I'm a quitter.  Lol.  I've smoked a few real cigs in that time and omg they are so gross.   
p999
aVI would've chose that over a Juul or other pod system any day. 
p1000
aVWhen you get drunk you cant taste shit, if I was you Id bring a juul if you had one, and hit that when you're trashed and you will get the best head rush.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;
p1001
aVconcerned smok infinix\u000a\u000aMy friends said my vape smells super chemically and terrible \u005c[they use juuls\u005c] and i use a smok infinix pod vape im concerned my pods might be fake or something anyone else have this issue with smok infinix
p1002
aVDude if it tastes fine to you I wouldn\u2019t worry about it. I doubt there\u2019s fake infinix pods out there anyway. Maybe your friends are just hating on what you have because it\u2019s not a juul, and you\u2019re saving money compared to them. 
p1003
aVJuul pod broke, I think, no way I smoked half a pod today - I count my puffs and I\u2019ve only had 10. So what the hell did I just inhale? I exhaled smoke of SOMETHING.\u000a\u000aSeriously though. I got in the car and took a puff, noticed I didn\u2019t get the bubbly sound so I pulled the pod out and it was empty. Yet I still puffed out something. Thoughts? Did the pod break and I just inhaled plastic or something??
p1004
aVTake a second and calm down. The juul has temp control, and won\u2019t let you puff if the coil/wick isn\u2019t wet. You got the last hit of juice out of it. You didn\u2019t inhale anything like plastic, and even a dry hit from a wick won\u2019t cause any need for a hospital visit, as long as it doesn\u2019t happen all day everyday
p1005
aVIt's a huge leap imo. Pod is huge, battery life is ridiculously long, no leaks whatsoever, feels nice in your hand. Plus the flavors are cheap as hell and are waaaay smoother than regular eliqiuds. The draw is identical to that of the juul, except with slightly more air room so it's satisfying as hell. I've never used a device I love so much. I'd highly recommend.
p1006
aVWhatever you want. I have used 25-50 mg salts in 50-50 pgvg and freebase juice in all pg vg. No issues with anything. Very highly recommended. I have used the icare 1 and 2, aspire breeze 1 and 2, Juul, boulder, Phil, sourin air and drop... nothing compares to this pod..
p1007
aVJust bought one yesterday, love it. I love my juuls, but their quality control is garbage (1/4 pods tends to be leaky or annoying) and the cost is way to high. I'm using the.5 pod with 25 MG nic salts and the Orion is great. I recommend it, hopefully it will last. Currently breazy has them for like 40 bucks and 2 packs of pods for around 8 dollars. 
p1008
aVWow! Thank you very much!!! Yeah I'm a beginner at all this all I've had before was a juul and that was pretty easy going. If you have any recommendations I'd appreciate it. I was looking for a pen type of vape, but now I'm all for any kind even the box ones. 
p1009
aVSo nicotine addiction is bad... hmm... never realized. Funny how these articles never mention how hard it is to quit smoking vs. or how much worse the 7000k chemicals in smoke are. Just Juul is bad, flavors are for kids (b/c you know adults don\u2019t like flavor.) Unfortunately the article goes beyond laughable to outright irresponsible. 
p1010
aVSo, the government blames just JUUL, fines them 15 Billion majillion dollars and then uses every available media outlet to further go after just JUUL for the loss in funds from Cigarette Taxes nationwide. \u000a\u000aGot it, god help Victoria's Secret when mommys little girl decides to follow Sharia Law and seek a lawyer.
p1011
aVthat's a whole lot of projection, there.\u000a\u000aI mean.. she looks set up for the long run... this aint no juul
p1012
aVI'm looking to switch from Juul\u000a\u000a[removed]
p1013
aVBest mods for salt nic?\u000a\u000aHave tried: Juul, Suorin Air &amp; Drop, Aspire Breeze and MiPod. \u000a\u000aI have been off the death sticks for a little under a year now. Juul was my gateway into the vape world, but quickly wanted more choices in flavor, reusability and airflow. Suorin products were a great first alternative, although not worth the dry hits / breathing in melting plastic. The MiPod is my go to right now, although hard to find places that sell carts. But all fail to give that same \u201cthroat hit\u201d like Juul. \u2014 which was a big contributor to reducing smoking cravings. Any suggestions for better mods than the following or juices that are similar to Juul\u2019s Virginia Tobacco? \u000a\u000aMuch appreciated!
p1014
aVSmoant it acts like a Juul however, you can buy refillable pods and nic salt juice at your choosing (and depending on how you use it a pod can last you about 2 weeks or so) and the Nic Salt can last you a month or more/less
p1015
aVI've been vaping for 4 years and have never used any pods until about 5 days ago my wife got me a smok infinix so I can use it at work because we don't get any breaks. Anyways I'm very impressed with it. Love that it's refillable, charges very quick, and last a long time. My friends say it hits way better than the juul. For $20- $25 I would recommend it to anyone. 
p1016
aVI feel you,i loved the throat on juul and its what help me quit cigs but quit juul because the inconsistency of the hits was frustrating.
p1017
aVTime to Upgrade\u000a\u000aHey Reddit, this is my first time posting here. I've been vaping for about 6 months, trying to quit smoking. I've been smoking like 6 years. Well, I started off alting between the Juul and badge, and now I'm using a voopoo mojo. The time has come to upgrade. I'll use my mojo as a back up, but I'm looking in to purchasing the voopoo drag mini. Can someone explain how the whole external battery thing works? Also is the mini a good choice? Thanks in advance!
p1018
aVMine is hitting just fine. If you are using the pod that it came with, it doesn\u2019t hit that well. I pair mine up with juul pods and it works for me. 
p1019
aVTry a different pod, those have been getting great reviews. That doesn\u2019t mean yours can\u2019t have an issue, but try a legit juul pod before you give up on it 
p1020
aVIf I pair it with juul pods they burn way more easily.
p1021
aVYou can put juul pods in there?
p1022
aVI stopped using juul because of the consistancy of the hits,one hit would be good then the next one was terrible.how does this device hit?
p1023
aVI\u2019ve only had one pod do that to me but it hits very well. I like the size of this mod better than the actual juul and also it has a bigger battery 
p1024
aVUnfortunately it\u2019s just not a very well-executed device. Bigger battery? Great. But as far as I know, it lacks the temp control circuitry that a conventional JUUL uses to make pods last. 
p1025
aVHow does the draw compare to a Juul?
p1026
aVMore airflow options for sure cause of the adjustable airflow below the drip tip. But overall a better device that the juul in every aspect
p1027
aVIt was kinda like a JUUL
p1028
aVOooh ya someone told me that once about sugar. \u000a\u000aAnd thanks for the tip, I was looking to buy another device since this one is janky af but my SO went and bought a juul without telling me so ill wait till my breeze craps out....
p1029
aVWaiting on my new mod, juices coils and juul pods 
p1030
aVLevel up balor mango, lava flow by naked, pink lemonade by element, melonburst by... Not sure who, honestly. It's called the burst line though. Last but not least, Juul mango pods.
p1031
aVVape Juice and Kit Inquiry\u000a\u000aI am relatively new to vaping. Started with a Juul, replaced exchanged that with a Suorin Drop (terrible product), then I ultimately  transitioned to a Smok OSUB 80W baby kit. Now that I\u2019m fully accustomed to an 80W vaporizer, I want to buy a 225W starter kit. Should I purchase the 225W kit, and what wattage do most people use with such a box mod? \u000a\u000aAs for my other question, when I purchase vape juice, they ask what strength I desire, and I give them a number (1-10, they probably go higher, I assume). So, I select the juice, tell them the potency (8), then they mix the juice with pure nicotine (it\u2019s in a large tank)  to match my request. So, would an 8 entail 8mg/60mL, or an 8% concentration of nicotine? I know most Juuls pods have a 5% concentration. Also, since the juice already contains nicotine (one I purchased the other day contains 3mg/60mL, would they just add an additional 5mg of nicotine to accomplish an 8% concentration? Thanks. 
p1032
aVA 5% concentration is 50 mg/ml. That's about right for a Juul: they advertise that there pods have an equivalent to a half-pack of cigarettes. I've seen comments about 60 but I would be surprised if a store mixed an 80 mg/ml for you.
p1033
aVThe latest propaganda I saw was at the gamer awards. Apparently vaping means you're going to turn to cigarettes soon! and a single juul pod has as much nicotine as an entire pack of smokes!! They must think you smoke the whole juul in one go and then throw it out like a cig LOL.
p1034
aVA Juul pod does contain 20 cigs (a whole pack) of nicotine, but the part that they don't say that while nicotine is addictive it is clinically harmless and not linked to cancer unlike the cancer stick counterparts.
p1035
aVI mean nicotine causes high blood pressure, but my main point was you don't vape a whole juul pod at once. It's like saying a keg is more deadly and addictive than a 6 pack.
p1036
aVI'll go through a 6% Juul pod in a day, that's why I stick to my subohms.
p1037
aVDoes it have a throat hit like a juul?
p1038
aVSorry I haven't vaped Juul. So can't really tell. But I can tell you with a 35mg salt nic I was feeling it pretty good on my throat even with the lowest power setting. I was vaping Hawaiian POG by NKD 100.  
p1039
aVGet a vladdin re with 60mg juice to replicate a juul.
p1040
aVThe juul worked wonders for me. Quit my heavy longterm (40 yr) habit in one day!  Pods are pricey but much cheaper than cigs. I had them autoshipped monthly so I never ran out. I have recently, after 6 months of juul and also some other pod systems, stepped over to a sub ohm box mod and lower nicotine.
p1041
aVFrom my experience, new vapers aren\u2019t looking for prebuilt direct lung squonk mods, they\u2019re looking for a similar draw to a cigarette and ease of use above all else. I was the same as you, I transitioned with an alien and tfv12 cloud king, but we\u2019re in the minority not the majority. I\u2019ve seen more success stories in real life with the juul than anything else, but that t18 is real deal quality and perfect mtl draw.
p1042
aVJuul is more like a vape for princesses 
p1043
aVI think innovations on an existing product are legally allowed but I'm not 100%. Depends on how particular the parent company is if you use Juul labs as an example. There are a few "Juul compatible" pods that are neither licensed or approved they're trying to get off the market
p1044
aVOf course. Look at the ofrf mesh for the profile(granted they may actually be Wotofo) a company in the uk do pods for the minifit. Other pod systems fit Juul pods, 
p1045
aVLooking for a new vape\u000a\u000aI have a juul and I am looking at getting a new pod style vape. What are your guys suggestions? 
p1046
aVI\u2019ve been filling juul pods with 35mg salts and having good results. Bought a breeze 2 and is really harsh using the same juice. Quit smoking with refilling pods for 35 days.\u000a\u000a
p1047
aVSo I carved some juuls as gifts for the holidays\u000a\u000a
p1048
aVI dislike juuls but dang those are looking nice \U0001f60d
p1049
aVSick of buying crappy pod vapes\u000a\u000aCan anyone recommend a decent open pod system for nic salts, I\u2019ve used many different ones and they seem to be crap compared to the Juul. I just want something dependable that has a good hit and doesn\u2019t leak or burn out fast, thanks
p1050
aVOrion if you want to dial everything in and really get into it. You'll have to use the escribe software to program it or you'll be stuck with the stock presets. They're not bad, just not great.\u000a\u000aNext is the Innokin EQ on sale now for $14. Its a no brainer for that price and flavor is close to the Orion. Uses mesh coil pods that last longer than other pods.\u000a\u000aAspire Spryte or Nautilus, Aspire needs no introduction. Replaceable coils AND pods. You also have 4 different resistance coils to choose from.\u000a\u000aKwit stick if you want something like the Juul but works way better. It's also made by Aspire.
p1051
aVThis! It was basically only JUUL when I started vaping but if there had been as many pod systems as there are now I'd have started there. Definitely closer to a cigarette feeling. 
p1052
aVThanks for all the tips. I tried to figure it out myself but I was just stumped, I'm not new to vaping at all but the pod devices are a new thing for me. I was using a juul but it's expensive af compared to using an actual pod system
p1053
aVI have sooooo much to learn. I started on the Juul but couldn't afford pods that were almost as expensive as cigarettes. My first "real vape" is this Suorin Drop, but this thing is so hit or miss when I put in a new pod. Sometimes it'll work, sometimes it won't. Sometimes the pods go in regular, sometimes they only work backwards. So annoying!
p1054
aVI don\u2019t wanna way overhype it. I\u2019ve owned like 10 pod systems, compared to the nexus, drop, juul, infinix, air, slik, kato, mipod, Rubi and warlock I love it. Now if you\u2019re comparing flavor to a subohm or rda or what not, you\u2019ll be disappointed. Just making sure you knew where I\u2019m coming from lol.
p1055
aVI've only ever used a Juul, Suorin Drop, and a Smoant S8 so I don't even know what I'm missing from a subohm lol. The idea of being able to control the airflow with the Orion Go is kinda blowing my mind lol.
p1056
aVNah, not big on mint, I did like the juul mint.
p1057
aVYeah same. Weird thing is I hated menthol cigarettes but got hooked on juul's mint. Go figure.
p1058
aVWell, I bought a JUUL to help me get off the smokes. Smoking 2 packs a day, feeling like there's an elephant on my chest. I was 21.\u000a\u000aI am now 22, a year later, and if it wasn't for that stupid looking small piece of shit I'd still be smoking. I think JUUL has helped a lot of people.  
p1059
aVIt has, and even the teens that use it would\u2019ve probably been smoking cigarettes if not for the juul. I was in high school in the 90\u2019s and more kids smoked them than that juul now. It\u2019s such bullshit propaganda.
p1060
aVImo Teens attach to fads or whatever seems cool at the time and juul was just another thing that got latched onto just like smoking weed at house parties or drinking or having sex or whatever\u2019s \u201cin\u201d but regardless if juul wasn\u2019t a thing , they would find something else to smoke lol. It just makes it easy to target for big agencies when they\u2019re flavored because flavors outside of tobacco or mint apparently automatically means they specifically wanted kids to use them.
p1061
aVSwiching to Salt Nic\u000a\u000aHey guys, I was going to post this on /r/SaltVaping but it's kind of a ghost town over there. I'm looking to make the switch to salt nic for when I'm out of the house because of the size of the vapes themselves. As much as I love my box it's a lot to lug around on the daily. I don't want to go the Juul route because of the price of cartridges, I'm looking for something with refillable pods. Everyone seems to like the Smok Nord but I've heard mostly negative things about them as a company (shitty products, bad customer service, etc.). I've tried to compare it to other salt vapes, but every time I search "Smok Nord vs" the results just compare it to the Novo, the previous model. What other vapes could I compare it to?
p1062
aVWell I believe the nicotine rush you get from Juul is because it's way above 6mg. Juul has about 60mg per ml iirc. So I feel you would be fine trying out 12 if you take it slow(getting over nicatined is kinda like getting dope sick). However it's worth noting your tolerance will grow over time as your body gets used to having more nicotine and you'll eventually stop getting that head rush regardless aside from maybe your first bit of the day. \u000a\u000aI would look into getting the Mesh Pro tank for better flavor and I believe cloud production. Mixing a 6 with a 3 would make a 4.5 mostly as the lower strength dilutes the higher strength. If anything get a 12mg and 3/6mg bottle of the same flavor and if 12mg ends up being to much you can dilute it down with the lower bottle. 
p1063
aVYeah Juul uses nic salts since it\u2019s a lower power device to deliver that throat punch and rush. If I got some flavorless nic salts if there\u2019s such thing putting a tiny amount in my tank would that work? Vaping nic salt e juice alone in a sub ohm I heard is a bad idea 
p1064
aVWhat do y\u2019all think of the smok novo?\u000a\u000aI already have a pretty good set up. My only gripe with it is I feel it too big and I want something smaller. I really don\u2019t want get a juul and won\u2019t but was am wondering your opinions on it.
p1065
aVIs it like the juul where have to keep buying pods?
p1066
aVSort of. The juul is closed pod, meaning prefilled. The novo is not, its made to be refillable. \u000aInstead of changing coils, you just change the pod. 
p1067
aVI like my Juno 10x more than the juul. Good luck to your dad!
p1068
aVNever Vaped; Give me advice\u000a\u000aLike the title says, I've never owned a vape or tried one. I tried a Juul yesterday for the first time but didnt feel anything. I dont smoke but tried it about 4 years ago to see what it was about. I had no problem quitting cold Turkey, as I've done with dip and chew in the past.\u000a\u000aMy suppliment of choice has lately been caffeine. I do a lot of studying and work full time. I take different suppliments that are considered nootropics. I know nicotine has cognitive benefits as long as you can avoid addiction and limit your intake. I also read that caffeine is available in a vape liquid.\u000a\u000aWhat vapes and liquids do you all consider the best and what would you reccomend as a setup to start out with?  \u000a\u000aP.S. My mother has smoked for nearly 30 years, so I'm hoping she will see me enjoy a vape, decide to try it, and possibly switch off of cigarettes. 
p1069
aVSounds good, I haven't had a tobacco flavored juice in a while, I used to get a house blend that was very similar, but it had caramel in it as well. \u000aI vaped for a solid year without smoking at all, and then one night I just really wanted a cig for some reason(too drunk to make good decisions lol \U0001f643) and I ended up getting back into smoking around a pack per day while all my vape shit sat in a cabinet. That lasted for about a year. Then a couple months ago I decided to try to get back into vaping with the pod systems and it's been going well. Tried juul, then I got a joyetech exceed edge, and now I have the lost vape orion. I like the orion enough that I'm using it primarily, but it's far from perfect that's for sure! 
p1070
aVI hope! Tbh the "real" test for me was the after dinner cigarette. You know, that insatiable urge to smoke after you stuff your face with a fat plate. My vape satisfies that urge, thank god. (My blu/juul/shitty lil pen vapes never did the trick, still wanted a cig). But yeah, after a meal or a few beers, when I REALLY start craving/fiending for a cigarette, my vape will satisfy that craving. So I think I'll be good. Hope the same is true for you bro.
p1071
aVJuul not worth the hype!\u000a\u000a
p1072
aVThe juul just got released in Germany a few days back and I got a testing device by my local vape shop.\u000aI must say, why is it hyped so much?\u000aI get it, with 20mg it's supplements cigs pretty well, but what is that flavor? Non existence? 
p1073
aVI have to admit. This is the thing that got me all the way here.  I wasn't even going to try to quit smoking. In fact I liked it.  Wandered into my local gas station, and there was a half off sale.  I had never even heard of a Juul..  So I bought it.  I was like how in the hell can this be 50 bucks.  And it was no joke.  I dropped cigs that day!  As the week progressed, I had not one craving.  Then it started.  The nic sickness, the leaking, the pods flying around everywhere.  Lol.  I jumped on the internet and off I went.  3mos later I'm sitting here with 3 mods, a bunch of tanks. A new topside squonker and a profile RDA.   The obsession is real.  But I have to tip my hat to Juul for getting me off the smokes after 30 years.  
p1074
aVIt got me off of cigarettes faster than a mod. Juul serves its purpose for getting nic into your body when your out and about. not everyone cares about flavor or clouds nor do they wanna carry mods and juice. And since pods are sold everywhere it\u2019s convenient. Besides every vape company is now coming out with pod systems because of how successful juul is. The only other decent pod system is 60 bucks (lost vape).
p1075
aVOf course it is. I also run a smok infinite, but the hit you get from a juul is pretty good.\u000aSalt nic is hard to get in Germany, as it is basically illegal. 
p1076
aVDon't get me wrong, juul has a place for sure in the vaping market and I honestly think that we needed a company as juul which is all over the media to make it clear.\u000a
p1077
aVI pre ordered one too in Germany. I always have a myblu in my pocket as a secondary, stealthy device. The Juul is just not as good as the blu in my opinion. With 20mg nic salts, you get almost no throat hit, the flavour isn't really good and the battery doesn't last even half a day... So no, wouldn't buy one again. 
p1078
aVThe flavor isn't the idea with a juul. It's for a quick nic fix, if you ever get a chance to try the actual 59mg pods we have in the usa and Canada you would understand. The throat hit is just amazing lol. However after about a month I'm back on my aegis/drop combo. 
p1079
aVI totally agree,and i love the throat hit,and the vuse vibe had an even better throat hit.its just disappointing that both devices are just so inconsistent with hits,like if the juul was consistent with each hit i would still be using it.
p1080
aVMy point exactly. I\u2019m giving you my perspective as a someone who used both a juul and a dual battery mod since this sub seems to shit on juuls 
p1081
aVLuucyz juul pods?\u000a\u000aAnyone heard of this company? Picked up at a gas station, no online presence anywhere I can find. Or Juucyz if they consider that a backwards J\u000a\u000ahttps://i.redd.it/e0d7x25omy521.png
p1082
aVHah hah, no kidding.  every time I see some little turd in the YouTube comments section basically bragging about how he smokes Juuls everyday in the middle school bathroom, I want to tell him to get off my f****** stoop.
p1083
aVYou can use salts in sub-ohm devices but you have to be careful of the strength you use, I would suggest 3mg/ml - 6mg/ml for sub-ohm. The reason being is that higher strength juices like the 20mg/ml - 50mg/ml are intended for MTL style tanks and pods that run at low wattages with high resistance coils so they don't go through much juice, where as sub-ohm tend to use high wattage and low resistance coils that will vaporise a lot of juice which is why sub-ohm generally uses 3mg/ml.\u000a\u000aThink of it this way, when I sub-ohm I get through around 10ml of juice a day, when I MTL I get through around 3ml of juice a day. When I sub-ohm 3mg/ml and I blow through 10ml of juice that is a 30mg of nicotine intake for the day which is on par with 30 cigs. When I MTL and go through 3ml of juice at 12mg/ml that is a 36mg nicotine intake for the day which is like 36 cigs. If I was to sub-ohm 12mg/ml it would be putting nicotine into my system way to quickly and I would have to make 3ml of juice last the whole day so there would be massive breaks between vapes and when I do vape there would be large quantities entering my system very quickly.\u000a\u000aSo high mg salts like 30mg/ml is totally intended for very low wattage and high resistance coils so that 1ml of juice can last you all day. This is why the kids are vaping 50mg/ml juuls and consuming multiple ml a day to chase a buzz, the headrush/dizzy feeling is the onset of nicotine sickness/poisoning.\u000a\u000aIf you have nic salts and would like to use them with your Mag, I would highly recommend picking up a MTL tank or a good rebuildable MTL like the Vandy Vape Berserker Mini and installing 1ohm or 1.5ohm coils and running them around 10-15w and you will be fine with stronger salts but unless you are running 3mg or 6mg salts give it a miss in your sub-ohm tank. Stay safe bud.

aVNew rig and juice, New problem\u000a\u000aSo I recently made the switch from Juul to a Novo with Saltd creme de mint juice/liquid. Not sure if its the liquid or what but I seem to get a queasy upset stomach from it. For context I used to smoke cigar's and dip so I have a fairly high tolerance for nicotine. \u000a\u000aI don't want to order another bottle of liquid just to find I have the same problem. Has anyone had anything similar happen to them? \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aIt really sucks to be balancing a sour stomach or nicotine cravings 
p1085
aVCan Salt-Based Nicotine juice be used in regular vape coils?\u000a\u000aI have a mod with a Falcon tank and a mesh coil (0.15 ohms), and I also have some leftover salt based nicotine juice from when I used to refill Juul pods.  Is it safe to use my salt nic juice in my tank? 
p1086
aVWhat appeals to RDA users or coilheads?\u000a\u000aI use a juul and spend the majority of my time in r/juul when on Reddit for something vape related but what appeals to the huge clouds and changing coils?\u000a\u000aI mean sure I get it\u2019s fun to have full control on the hit, throat hit, and best of all a large range of flavors but it seems like as much of a hassle. \u000a\u000aNow I had a small mod before my juul, I\u2019m not sure if the battery was wonky but I was changing coils every couple of days getting 200-300 hits before the coil head just tanked and burned, grossest taste in the world. But I was going through a pack of smok coils a week- as much as a juul costs here (Ca). \u000a\u000aEven the smell of the sickly sweat e juices and burning e juice makes me throw up, not exaggerating to. There\u2019s been multiple incidents of my friends hotboxing the car with vape and I uh blew chunks. \u000a\u000aNow please someone explain this; I know juul is a lot more money but I think it\u2019s worth the convenience, thoughts?
p1087
aVAnd I use an RTA on a regulated tube mod for the convenience. If you are happy with the expense and limited choice then we are happy with you. But for many like me cost IS an issue. I've got 2 mods (one for backup) and 2 identical RTA's (rebuildable tank atomizers). A spool of wire cost me $10 and will make me 100 coils. Cotton is $8.99 and will wick I don't know how many coils. I rewick every 7-10 days but haven't made a new coil in weeks. I buy the juice of my choice in larger bottles (I'm going to vape it anyway, so why not buy large bottles and save). I keep my second tank wicked, ready to go. When I need a rewick I simply swap tanks, prime the new one and I'm vaping again in minutes.\u000a\u000aI will probably recover my entire investment in what you put out for your Juul in a month.
p1088
aVDamn aggressive but I see your point. I just can\u2019t stand the smell of the juices though, juul juice is different. I had a mod and yeah you save money but I was also constantly playing with it, a plus for some people.
p1089
aVNot sure if posted already but you can get a free Juul from their very own website (In the UK at least)\u000a\u000a

aVJuul's are expensive but Vype's are the way to go\u000a\u000a
p1091
aVBig tobacco buys into juul for damn near 13B. 
p1092
aVYeah I don't like where this is going. Big tobacco has fuck loads of money to spend, and they seem to want to spend it on mediocre devices. I don't like the idea of companies with that kind of influence and financial power starting to prefer that vapers use devices like the Juul, rather than the variety of other options that are available to us right now. Who wants to bet that 2019 bring a whole lot of media attention to just how "dangerous" bigger mods, external batteries, subohm tanks and DIY vaping is.
p1093
aVJuul has been the biggest embarrassment in the vape industry. If it wasn\u2019t for them we wouldn\u2019t be looking at the harsh regulations, flavor bans, witch hunts that we are seeing. 
p1094
aVLet me rephrase my original statement...if it wasn\u2019t for Juuls popularity, which brought mass exposure to vaping, we would not see the rate of the flavor bans that we are experiencing. Once it became \u201cabout the kids\u201d and an \u201cepidemic\u201d is when things got worse than what they were. 
p1095
aVexposure to vaping products is exactly whats needed genius. Kids are inevitably going to be influenced by what adults/celebrities are doing but if more people are choosing  a JUUL over a cigarette, that should be a good thing. And frankly, JUUL has been more successful at popularizing vaping than any other company. It's why so many of them are coming out with pod systems.
p1096
aVi don't know whether any of those things will happen. Can they happen? sure. But you don't know either because you probably don't work for either company.  Big tobacco buying 35% of JUUL isn't selling out on the part of JUUL nor is it  a take over of the company. You don't know the nature of the agreement so making bold statements like 'they'll kill vaping' or 'they'll poison us' is  a bit of a stretch. Again, it's 35%. NOT a majority stake. And I was only responding to OP who claims the popularity of JUUL is a bad thing. Which it isn't. box mods have been around for years and they haven't been nearly as successful at getting people to stop smoking/ 
p1097
aVIf you want to personally attack my intelligence, then at the very least due so with forming a properly structured sentence, using capitalization where applicable and punctuation. \u000a\u000aNow with that being said, yes kudos too and I commend Juul for creating an innovative product that assisted smokers to leave cigarettes behind. Every time I read about someone on any of the vaping subreddits who quit smoking or any form of tobacco I congratulate and encourage them on quitting. I am one of those quitters and know the struggles all too well. \u000a\u000aMy rub with Juul, the company, and why I say they are an embarrassment to the vaping community is this...they aren\u2019t Casaa, GrimmGreen or any of the thousands, maybe even millions of vapors or vape advocates who have and continue fighting for the right to vape, have vaping labeled as a successful cessation method and or continual innovation in vaping products. \u000a\u000aWhen the going got tough and the FDA started tapping on their heads they caved like scared *insert NSFW adjectives and noun here*!\u000a\u000aAll of the money they made off the hard earned backs of the former smokers that their products helped, lined their bank accounts. They didn\u2019t use it to fight the man. They didn\u2019t use it to promote advocacy and file law suits to protect us vapors. They gave in or up, sold out and made even more money by selling it to big tobacco, pharma and government. \u000a\u000aYou tell me how a guy or gal who owns a B&amp;M and has nothing compared to what Juul had monetarily, will sacrifice everything they have to fight the large giants but Juul execs can walk away laughing all the way to a bank in the Caribbean. To me sir that is the epitome of embarrassing to our community. \u000a\u000aThis industry has spawned millions of people who were or are in it for the quick cash grab, which saddens me, but for those of us who it has changed our lives for the positive we are very passionate about protecting our right to vape, have it classified  as a true cessation method to quitting combustion-able tobacco and educating others. \u000a\u000aAnd this is why I feel that Juul has been one of the biggest embarrassments to the vaping community. \u000a\u000aYou don\u2019t have to agree with me but at the very least due not insult my intelligence. 
p1098
aVthe basic point I\u2019m trying to make is that pinning the blame on one product is moronic . when something becomes popular regulations follow, especially when kids start to pick it up. Kids pick it up specifically because it\u2019s popular with adults and celebrities. \u000a\u000aVaping is more than a passion product or a community. It\u2019s an industry. Companies are going to do everything in their power to maximize profit. Welcome to capitalism. That\u2019s what running a business is. If box mods were half as popular as juul companies like smok or voopoo, or 528customs would be under the same microscope and would get the same offers that juul gets from big tobacco. \u000a\u000aThe statement that juuls popularity is what\u2019s wrong with vaping is a stupid thing to say and I simply called you out on it. And like my previous post said, juul isn\u2019t being taken over. It\u2019s a 35 percent stake. Read up on how mergers and acquisitions work before claiming that juul is \u2018selling out\u2019.\u000a\u000aAs far as my spelling goes I\u2019m on my phone and this conversation isn\u2019t that important that I need to proof read this. 
p1099
aVThis just isn't possible to do with vaping. There's no Central industry to take over and monopolize. Most vape shops are stocked with locally produced juices. Anyone with a half a brain can make their own juice by following a simple recipe online. And a mod and atomizer are just a few pieces of metal that fit together and a battery. There's no way to really regulate this. They can keep cracking down on juul but there isn't shit they can do about enthusiasts who use rebuildables. You can't compare big tobacco to vaping. The only thing they can do is make nicotine itself illegal, which would cause a huge uproar and reduce the huge state income from tobacco taxes.    \u000a\u000aThis save the kids argument is the best the gov could come up with. And it's complete insanity considering tobacco use among kids is way down. Every kid who vapes instead of smokes is what, at least 90% better off? It's all silliness. Teenagers are getting wasted, getting pregnant, getting high, getting shit education every day and we are worried about vaping? It's all about money and control, mostly money. NO ONE is gonna stop a kid from doing the opposite of what they are told. The media circus about how bad vaping supposedly is, is 100% going to make even more teens vape. All of us from the "this is your brain on drugs" commercials know exactly what I mean. I remember thinking "wow that looks cool" lol.
p1100
aVDude I\u2019m not insulting you personally. I don\u2019t even know you. I\u2019m simply calling your statement on juuls moronic because you\u2019re only looking at it through one perspective which is that of someone deep in the vape community. You don\u2019t take into account business considerations and calling it a \u201csellout\u201d shows that. \u000a\u000aDid you ever think that with the influx of cash coming in from big tobacco , vape companies may be better able to get through regulation and taxes. Maybe afford lobbyists to actually go to seats of power (more effective than YouTubers crying about it online) . Maybe put more money in innovating the product and coming up with other safer nicotine delivery systems. Big tobacco sees vaping as their future because while they are making boat loads of money cigarette use has been declining and still is. 
p1101
aVAhh that sucks. This is why I only bring my juul to work. I do demolition and I wouldn\u2019t be too upset losing a juul
p1102
aVYeah shes stubborn. She doesnt wanna quit yet and I know that feeling. Shes started using a juul here and there... she doesnt like my mods. Maybe I'll try to get her into some better MTL styles
p1103
aVDiscussion: Health Differences Between Using a Vape and Using Prebuilt E-Cigs?\u000a\u000aRecently I've noticed a ton of articles that are confusing the public. From what I've gathered, prebuilt E-Cig options like Juul Pods are terrible for you in comparison to using a mod with store-bought Vape Juice. Can anyone confirm this and possibly provide more information on the subject and other types. People are saying that vaping is worse than smoking as per some article they read online. Seems like the articles that say this are referring to tests done on disposable E-Cigs and just calling it "Vaping" in general.
p1104
aVI mean, they all seem to be smokers so its good to show them an alternative. But i personally feel like juul is not the greatest way to introduce them. Ofcourse i dont think they should give them insane mods but still... there are many better pod systems out there. They seemed to hate it so they probably wont ever give iy a chance aymore, wich sucks
p1105
aVI have not... Are you referring to the juul? Seems super expensive.?
p1106
aVVaping Advice\u000a\u000aI want to buy a new ecig and it needs the following things:\u000a\u000a- The amount of vapour and scent has to be around something like a juul. (Being able to adjust that would be cool)\u000a- It cant be a pod system.\u000a- Size has to be small to medium.\u000a- Easy to maintain. (Low cost coils and easy to replace)\u000a- Has to be around $50\u000a\u000aIm relatively new to vaping and I've tried juul and the limitless pulse. Im tired of refilling the juul and having the limitless leak everywhere. Please help a noob out. Im tired of buying things im disappointed with. Thanks pals.
p1107
aVThat\u2019s awesome. Juuling is such a waste of money it\u2019s comical 
p1108
aVNice, Juuls are definitely just another thing for people to get addicted to instead of cigs. They are not interested in helping people quit, instead they would rather just increase their market share. Those devices create a dangerous reward system that almost always leads to Nicotine addiction rather than cessation.
p1109
aVAnyone who saw that news interview with the God of Vapes or whatever his name is, should be straight down to these stores and take advantage of this great deal! \u000a\u000aThat bloke is what gives vapers a bad name and juul IMO is just one of the worst companies to buy
p1110
aVWell, I no longer use my juul, but I\u2019ve seen 4 people I work with use them to quit smoking in the last year with juul, I don\u2019t see demonizing something that does that. Nicotine isn\u2019t quite the devils poison some are making it out to be. Overpriced and lack of flavors are the only downside I see.
p1111
aVI\u2019ll go as far of giving the Juul the novelty of being one of the OG closed systems, but let\u2019s be real here. There\u2019s so many better refillable devices nowadays that it\u2019s not worth all the trouble that\u2019s\u000aentailed with Juuling. Juul is a insanely pricey and the QC sucks. 
p1112
aVSorry I should clarify better, Juuls can be used to quit by smokers. However, a lot of times when people who are just \u201chitting their friends\u201d or young kids use them they unknowingly sign up for something they thought was something else. the nicotine salts that are used are very concentrated and the way the Juul allows your BP to spike creates a buzz that a lot of people who think they are using something harmless become addicted to.
p1113
aVJuuls were the beginning of pod systems, most of us people who vaped way back when remember the closed cartomiser systems that were around with the ego and ijoy stick systems. This is just the third wave of the technology. 
p1114
aVLost Vape's Orion system is refillable as far as I can tell, without compromising its system of having a podlike hit. So if you want better flavors than juul, it seems like the one to go to. I don't have one but it's on my bucket list
p1115
aVI would agree that Juul are low quality and would test positive for formaldehyde and heavy metals. \u000a\u000aI would like to see a study of an rda at low wattage running pure juice (just pg, vg, flavor, no sweetener, and nic). This is what I make at home 
p1116
aVFucking RIDICULOUS waste of money. I bought one to quit smoking without researching or asking the price. Cost me $50 for a starter kit. Thought it was pricy but worth it. Then a 4 pack of pods are $15 and they run out so fast. So within a week I spent more on Juul shit than I would on over a month's worth of cigarettes. Said fuck it and bought a proper mod. Cost the same as a Juul and the juice is so cheap and lasts forever. Juuls are the dumbest thing ever. 
p1117
aVwith that being said, juuls have become the new face of vaping and makes all of vaping look bad because most people won\u2019t put the time into understanding it\u2019s a lot harder to get heavily addicted to low mg free base nic juice 
p1118
aVThat\u2019s fair but pretty most vapes can be traced back to someone who quit smoking.  Whether it\u2019s a kid hitting their friends, or buying one to \u201cfit in\u201d vape products, including juul, only exist because smokers invented the market. \u000a\u000aIf they weren\u2019t hitting their friends juul there\u2019s a good chance they would be hitting their friends cig like many of us did.
p1119
aVThen sell the juul's
p1120
aVJuul is re-releasing flavors to vape shops only but not to convenience stores. \u000a\u000aJuul rep came to my shop just last week to tell us about it and give us a neon juul sign.
p1121
aVNah, turn them into Juul-Jenga
p1122
aVWhy is it better then the juul?
p1123
aVOoohhh send me a couple then. I love mine. Save for the prefilled pods Its the best nic salt pod system imo. Love My drippers to death but nothing beats the size and convince of the juul when im not at home. Good promotion though tbh only thing is I'd maybe try to turn them on to a different pod device instead of &gt;12mg nictone because the transition from a juul to like 6mg liquid would probably be tough for a lot of people who used the juul to stop smoking cigarettes. But that's one of those things that can be diffrent with everyone 
p1124
aVI can back this up. Switched from juul to mipod a few months back. Better flavors, similar cigarette like feel and I'm saving buttloads of money.
p1125
aVA new Juul is like $50, so $10 off a starter kit and $5 off juice (another like $10 maybe) seems a little low, but otherwise this idea is dope idea 
p1126
aVbetter is relative, but compared to juul, vlaadin re is refillable, obviously way cheaper, got clean flavor from ceramic coil, and personally has better mtl experience from tighter draw
p1127
aVIf only a pod system could get a MTL like the way juul does. I wish there were more flavors but most pods can't compare to the way the juul hits 
p1128
aVAre nic salts fine to use in the Zenith? I\u2019m looking for something to replace my Juul for my on the go quick nicotine fix. I have a Suorin Air and I feel like I have to be extra careful with it as to not burn the coils...

aVPretty much any half decent refillable pod system with 50mg nic salts. I\u2019ve been using a suorin air for over 6 months, and it hits harder than a juul. Picked it up for less than 20 bucks too. 
p1133
aVWhat\u2019s with the hate for a Juul? I\u2019m a noob and haven\u2019t switched to a vape yet so sorry for those who already know
p1134
aVI tried one at first. Then I got my first big girl vape with a wood pulp/mesh coil (looking at you sexy Falcon tank) and I have never looked back. The flavor is divine. Juul and other such devices can't hold a candle to them. That being said, I've heard great things about the Aspire pod setups.
p1135
aVFuck Juul forever. 
p1136
aVIf the juul had refillable pods i would be all over it\u000a\u000aThe thing is really well designed, it just doesnt have flavors
p1137
aVThey do, just not sold by juul/pax
p1138
aVThe difference is that with a regular mod for salts (say $40) you can make a $20 bottle last at least a week and you have TONS of flavor options and nic level so you can actually decrease your nic dependence. \u000a\u000aWith the Juul you have very limited flavor options (like 5) and only one nicotine strength (very fucking high) and the pods are like $23 for 4 and last 1-2 days each. It's basically the most expensive way you can vape and you don't want to stop because the nicotine level is so damn high people often get themselves more addicted then they were to begin with, or get a Juul for fun and gain a habit. \u000a\u000a
p1139
aVI agree. Get the same/better buzz and hit from a Breeze or some other refillable pod systems plus a better battery life. Juul is highway robbery. I regret every penny I gave them. 
p1140
aVAltria (Marlboro) just bought a stake in Juul, so fuck Juul because fuck Big Tobacco.
p1141
aVJust put an eon smoke pod in ur juul and everythings all good 
p1142
aVWe\u2019ve been an authorized dealer for many years.   Our rep said nothing about using a proprietary age checker at all.\u000a\u000aPerhaps they are simply weeding out the lesser shops or ones potentially selling fake juul products.  Not implying that you are.
p1143
aVI\u2019ve refilled juul pods before, it\u2019s not the worst thing in the world. But I much more prefer using something that\u2019s supposed to be refilled like a badge, novo, drop, or air.
p1144
aVThe reason I like the juul is because it hits so welll. Do any of those compare?
p1145
aVBut the smok novo is too bulky. One of the biggest reasons I like the juul is because of its size and weight. It\u2019s much easier to use at work because I often don\u2019t have pockets so I tape it to the inside of my work clothing
p1146
aVNot a bad point to bring up. Juul got something extremely right, that being extreme durability and minimal size compared to other options. 
p1147
aVI don't really think it's fair to juul to not sell their product just because of the gov propaganda campaign against them. They didn't really do anything wrong accept happen to be the top selling ecig. It could just have easily been any company on top that got targeted.    \u000a\u000aThe fact is a lot of older people use them for the simplicity, my mom for example will never be able to use anything remotely complicated, she can barely operate a TV remote. Something super simple like a juul that she can get at a gas station is probably the only thing that's going to get her off the smokes.
p1148
aVAhhh man this is great. Any problem with me sharing this on Facebook? Me and my cousin have been going on and on about the problem those damn Juul\u2019s are causing and the limitations on it as well.... 
p1149
aVExcept there's a **very large** population of people who don't wanna "learn to use mods" and fuck with all the maintenance and refilling. And even at $4 a, pod it's still twice as cheap (sometimes 3x cheaper depending the state) than a pack of cigarettes.\u000a\u000aNot everyone buying juuls are doing it as a hobby, quite the opposite really. That's there market - long term cigarette smokers looking to switch without having to have a big box or not giving a shit about "blowing sick clouds bruh" 
p1150
aVLooking for a vape device that is refillable with 0mg nicotine\u000a\u000aI am thinking of getting a vape, I first saw the Juul and thought it looked very sleek and was leaning towards buying one. I then realized that it\u2019s not officially refillable and there\u2019s only a workaround to refilling the pods. I am looking for something that can hold 0mg nicotine and easily refillable but about the same size as the Juul or Novo. Since this is my first time buying a vape, I just want to know whether nicotine free is harmful in any way?\u000a\u000aThanks
p1151
aVNic free is prolly somewhere between as healthy as oxygen and the outside air in large cities. You can purchase aftermarket juul pods that come empty and are refillable, but I don\u2019t think you get enough flavor from a juul to be worth using it for flavor only. Look at the lost vape Orion, innokin eq or smok NORD I\u2019d looking for a smallish device that can give decent flavor.

aVMust say, i really don't like the way juul is growing right now. Feel like the policians will change the regulations if it gets popular so we all suffer 
p1155
aVLate af but oh well. I don\u2019t know what a Vladdin is, might check it out, but I DO own 2 suorin drops and an air, and I honestly prefer the air. Drops are great, and are much more durable than the air, but I feel like the drop pops and leaks more. Also has shit hits if I haven\u2019t ripped for a couple hours. The air pm never has issues (atleast for me), and always seems to have a reliable hit. It feels smoother than a drop. Plus it\u2019s a lil cheaper. Pods are the same price. I\u2019d honestly just buy both, their great devices. Also nice to have a lil rotation going. I use a juul, air, drop, vagon, badge, breeze 2, and the Eon device. I use a different device daily.

aVIt\u2019s called an \u201calt.\u201d, I work for a supermarket chain in NZ and these are literally the only ones we stock but yeah I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty comparable to a Juul , 40mg juice, feels a lot more like a cig than a box mod does and it\u2019s a hell of a lot more discreet 
p1163
aVI personally likes blu tobacco flavor other then Juul. Love the ashtray aroma. Lol

aVCongrats I just switched to vaping about a month ago I had been smoking cigs since I was 9 and just quit a month ago now I\u2019m 17 juul is a device from god

aVSuggestions for good nic salt juices and compatible vapes on directvapor?\u000a\u000aI am thinking about switching to nic salt juices because I am not sure but I feel like they are cheaper than freebase or at least coming from a Juul. Not sure if these are false claims tho.

aVLooking for new refillable pod system. Also some tips on what to build/what wattage for nic salt until I get one\u000a\u000aHey all. Nic salts got me back into vaping after a long hiatus back to cigs. I had a juul, then a suorin vagon. Juul was too expensive per week and the vagon crapped out on me. Any advice on a good pod mod for salts? \u000a\u000aIt's gonna be a few weeks before I can afford a new mod with Xmas coming up and all so I'm trying to build on my old dna75 until I can get a new one. What resistance should I be going for roughly and what wattage should I be vaping at? I heard salts can be pretty harsh on the wrong build. Any advice is welcome
p1167
aVI'm not the biggest fan of pod systems myself and I hate to be generic, but from what I've heard (anecdotal) a lot of people have managed to quit using juul
p1168
aVI feel you man! I have to deal with people like this a lot, and it's sad because idiots keep winning! Aside from old friends who sneer at you and/or tease you for being a pussy for vaping (no longer friends), i experienced the following that really baffled me:\u000a\u000acase 1: Got my youngest brother in law to start vaping and quit smoking. He smokes half a pack daily. Comes from a family of smokers. His wife hates vaping for some reason and actually managed him to quit vaping and go back to smoking by making it too damn hard to vape around her and actually encouraging him to just smoke "because cig smoke smells better than that sickeningly sweet vape cloud"\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aCase 2: Bought a juul type vape for my father in law (smokes 2 packs a day average) , used it for a week but failed to quit smoking because everybody else kept hassling him about it and smoking around him. He passed away a last month due to lung complications. Nobody blames smoking.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aCase 3: Nephew started Vaping, His mom got him to go back to smoking because the ads say vaping is bad and it'll explode on his face.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aCase 4: Cousin got his college kid started on Vaping.  Kid doesn't smoke, he just want's to bond with his kid and that's the only solution he found. Kid started from zero nic and now he's on 6mg.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aSo yeah, education and awareness is important, but there will always be idiots who will keep ruining it for everybody.

aVNewbie seeking advice on upgrading from an AIO system\u000a\u000aI started with the Juul, and now I have an Aspire Nautilus AIO, which I'm happy with. I'd like to try a more advanced system, but it's pretty bewildering for a beginning vaper. I'm mainly looking for longer battery life, a bigger tank (the Nautilus is 4.5ml), and something fairly simple to operate in a fairly compact package. I'm not much interested in huge clouds of vapor, but that might be cool to try. u/MysticWitDaMelody posted about their Vaporesso Revenger X, and that looks like it might be a good first-timer unit. Any recommendations, tips and helpful hints would be greatly appreciated.
p1170
aVThank you for taking the time to lay all of this out for me. I'll have to ponder all of this for a while. I think coil building is about two levels of involvement above where I want to be in vaping. I watched a couple of beginner videos, and that's way more time and effort than I'm willing to put in. I'm happy with the Nautilus AIO, but I just thought that since I like the Nautilus so much better than the Juul, maybe there was another step up I should be looking at. Thanks again for all the help.
p1171
aVOhmio and juuliet. (I know it's not a juul lol just sounds cool)\u000a\u000a
p1172
aVYou fellas know how to vape this without the batteries(kind of like how you could hit a juul pod with an iPhone charger) I don\u2019t have any batteries\u000a\u000a

aV50 mg in an rda?\u000a\u000aI've been using a suorin drop for the past few months after using a juul. I plan on buying an rda and mod. \u000aI dont wanna go through 3mg juice super fast so I'm wondering if I got a small rda or rta and build something small could I use 50mg nicotine and be decently safe.\u000aDont really care about getting a buzz just dont wanna buy so much juice. 
p1174
aVWhat's not cool is the battery level on the juul in the picture. 
p1175
aVThanks a lot, now I just bought a juul
p1176
aVI don't juul homie 16 and gotta fit get off my dick \U0001f601
p1177
aVYou right... But it ain't bad like cigs and you know how your gen was with them. At least they put em in the can. Don't get me banned, but I'm 16 and yea I will find a way to get either. I don't juul, but still got that nic salt. Suorins are big at my school.
p1178
aVI don't smoke cigs anymore. I vape 35mg nic. It won't take years off my life like cigs. I use the stress thing as an excuse for ppl to get off my dick cause I'm 16. Noicotine also has pros look it up. It does hurt the developing brain yes. My parents and other ppl IK smoked cigs with a developing brain. I would asume you know ppl too. Plenty of those ppl have no problems. I can quit I just don't... I like it. You were a kid once too. Jokes about the whole genration are cool, but is it realy the big deal the fda makes it? No. Thats my whole arguement. And its stupid for ppl to get mad at kids when they were kids once and know what its like. And in reality stuborn ppl aren't gonna change. I highkey doubt anything that comes out about vaping that hasn't been proven bjas already is going to come out. And I doubt I am gonna loose 10 yrs of my life by hitting a vape. So knqing that I don't see whay juuling is that big of an epidemic compared to cigs like the fda makes it. When I brought up cigs I was saying I am gonna get my hands on something and do it. It is just how I am... not heroine nicotine. Not met vapes. Not cocaine a mjch safer alternative to cigs...
p1179
aVHey, it's just because the tuul had to hit the juul
p1180
aVAs someone who works at a vape shop that occasionally gets calls asking if we provided the kids juuls for the love of god stop juuling in public if you're underaged! Like its seriously ruining a good thing for adults 
p1181
aVWhat's funny is that vape pens for oils or concentrates are way more common than juuls or vape mods.
p1182
aVThis is cringe, but if anyone underage that vapes is reading, stop fucking bringing that dumbass JUUL shit to school. First of all, JUULs are garbage. More importantly however, is the fact that you're ruining vaping for the rest of us that are of legal age. Vaping is getting a bad rep thanks to teenage stupidity. If you have a JUUL because you actually want to quit or whatever, at least use it in your home, don't get caught at school idiots. 
p1183
aVWhen my parents friends were in high school, they smoked in the locker rooms and people got caught. When I was in high school, people used to chew then went to vaping. It's not different than back in the old days. Teens will always be teens.\u000a\u000aAnd the number of kids that begged me to buy juul pods for them was actually concerning. If you're 14, you don't need to be vaping nicotine like that...

aVJUUL vs STLTH Review\u000a\u000a
p1185
aVJuul pods in England?\u000a\u000aNever been on this sub but I\u2019m assuming you guys aren\u2019t fans of the Juul lol anyways does anyone know if I can get pods over here in England? Im here on vacation and need some and I\u2019m not sure where to turn to
p1186
aVAny JUUL replacement? preferably flat like JUUL and never leaking pen setup?\u000a\u000aI'm a (used to be) a cigarette smoker for over 15 years but after I got into buying JUUL, I was able to transition from cigs to eCigs. \u000a\u000aHowever, now I'm looking for an alternative for my JUUL pods due to its prices that cost me over time. \u000a\u000aI tried a few vapes in the past and most recent being the SMOK Alien 220W but they all seem to leak and I stopped because \u000a\u000a1. It usually starts leaking and/or spitting nasty juice in my mouth and giving me burns in the throat and chest...\u000a2. It was too big to carry around in my pocket (and once it went sideways or upside down, it'll leak again etc)\u000a\u000aThe JUUL never does this and super reliable. It's small and extremely portable. \u000a\u000aIs there something like the JUUL that you've used for a while that you know I would LOVE???\u000a\u000aThanks guys.
p1187
aVSourin air with 50 nic juice to get the same throat hit as juuls pods are cheap and refillable and the system is cheap like 20-30$
p1188
aVI second the Orion, it\u2019s not shaped like the juul, but still very portable, would have none of the issues you mentioned. 
p1189
aVSo skeptical before it's been out for a while but smok just came out with a pod device called the slm and it's the best thing I've SEEN so far that matches the juul in size and draw to fire realm. Looks like it could be a winner for me if the pods are legit and it doesn't have the usual smok issues. It's definitely something I'll keep on the back burner though because it does have potential to be a nice refillable pod system 
p1190
aVABAY pod system is amazing, slightly shorter than a juul, but slightly thicker as well. pods last 2-3 times as long, and I believe they also have a higher nicotine concentration as well.  \u000a\u000a\u000a[https://www.abay.com](https://www.abay.com) if you want to check it out. \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aI have never had an issue with leaking. sometimes it'll spit a tiny bit, but all you need to do is slide a papertowel in where the pod goes. pm me if you have any questions!!!\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;
p1191
aVCorrect, I have not. I litterally just saw it like the night before listed on a website. There aren't even any reviews up anywhere just a couple overviews on it from China. So it could turn out to be decent. I really enjoy the look and size of it. Main reason I haven't given up the juul/refilling as a pod system is because of the size. But I'd definitely wait until it's been out a bit longer than like a week 
p1192
aVSo it\u2019s mainly online. I haven\u2019t seen them in store, however I can kinda help ya out. \u000a\u000aPm me, because I\u2019ve been using it for months, so I can tell ya how many you would need roughly a month depending on how many juul pods you use. Plus they do a discount thing that I could explain if you wanted. 
p1193
aVI like the JUUL the best in terms of the feel of it but the novo is a close second. JUUL pods are expensive so I just refill mine over and over again until they are completely burnt out. 
p1194
aVI had a sourin drop for a little bit before giving it to a friend, I liked it. It doesn't hit quite as hard as a juul, but it feels nice in the hand, pods hold a ton of juice and are meant to be refilled.
p1195
aVIs it easy to keep them from leaking? Also what salt nic mg do you use to mimic the Juul? 
p1196
aVNot as tight as a juul but still pretty average. It didn't stand out as super high or low airflow compared to other pod systems.
p1197
aVDI think a lot of the problems are user error Nd I\u2019m sure there are some defective pods. As far as flavor, I get better flavor than any pod I\u2019ve owned. I\u2019ve had the kandypens Rubi, juul, infinix, nexus, breeze, mipod, Kado stealth, Suorin Drop and air and allure slik and none match it in flavor. I think shit flavor is people trying to compare it to a mesh subohm or rda rta, flavor isn\u2019t going to compare to those, but for what it is I love the flavor. They\u2019re on sale at breazy right now for 39.99, if the code is still good 36.99 with cvd10. Pods are 7.99 2/pack. I sound like I\u2019m advertising, but I\u2019m not I just love it that much, and I think that is one hell of a deal. Ok, guess I\u2019m done gushing.
p1198
aVThose mipods fit juul pods correct?
p1199
aVI've had both, I am fairly certain they won't take juul pods as OP stated  
p1200
aVFriend had one or a mi clone that took juul pods and ripped them so much smoother. Need me one of those
p1201
aVOne thing to keep in mind salts are strong and new vapers tend to get more nicotine than they think. Meaning they rip a juul pod in a day which is just as bad as a pack of cigs. \u000a\u000aI would recommend looking into low mg juice even to start, pick an 11mg (16mg is about the strength of smoking a cig) or even an 8mg and educate them on the strength of juices. They can work their way down to 0mg juices and eventually they are only vaping for the habit. Once the nicotine addiction has faded it's easier to stop even using the vape! 
p1202
aVJuul. 
p1203
aVThis is a great place to start. Seems like a lot of older ex smokers use these. My dad uses those cheap cig likes still. I've tried to get him a juul or other pod systems and they just sit. The cig like seem to be pretty cheap, you just have to find a flavor you like because they all taste different, maybe buy a couple different brands of the disposable ones like blu, give them some options. 
p1204
aVGet them a juul.  They are sold in gas stations.  The starter pack is 25$ and the pods are 15-20$ for 4 and each pod is a pack of cigs in nicotine.  So it\u2019s half the price of cigs in a lot of places.  And they sell juul pods everywhere they sell cigs it seems like: no need to go to a vape shop and get into complicated stuff.  \u000a\u000aIf they like their juul then you can get them deeper into vaping but I\u2019d suggest startingwith the juul simply because it\u2019s easy and available everywhere.  No messing with refilling juice or coils or anything just pop the top onto the battery and start to inhale no buttons, no settings  you can use it right out of the box within 15 seconds and they work pretty well tbh.\u000a\u000aI myself use a juul when I\u2019m at work cuz I don\u2019t want to take my bigger more expensive vape out there. 
p1205
aVLooking for a Recommendation\u000a\u000aHello, I'm very new to vaping and have recently been using a Juul to stay away from cigarettes. I like it mainly for the portability factor. I can put it in my pocket and it's easy to carry. However I don't think it tastes that good, the pods are just as expensive as cigarettes in my state, and the battery doesn't last long at all. I was wondering if you all had any recommendations to replace the Juul. Something smaller and uses regular eliquid rather than preloaded pods.
p1206
aVInnokin EQ pod device.  Refillable system that's pocket friendly and has 4x the battery capacity of a Juul.
p1207
aVJuul or similar in the short term. Long term look into the Innokin Kroma-A and zenith tank. Get her a few sample packs (blue dot vapor and vape wild) to figure out what she likes. Good luck. We are always here if you need more help. 
p1208
aVThin pod systems?\u000a\u000aSo I\u2019ve been vaping about a year now, completely quit smoking. I\u2019m in the army, and we have some fancy pen-pockets on the sleeve of our uniforms. A juul fits perfectly in there, but juul\u2019s are far more expensive than I want to get into. I was hoping any of you knew of something around that size? Tried to fit a Boulder Rock in there but it\u2019s too big. Currently using the vaporesso nexus and renova zero but they feel EXACTLY like my car remote when in my pocket, so I pull my keys out on accident multiple times a day. Lol

aVHow does it compare to the juul? 
p1213
aVNot op, but I run 50mg Reds Apple Iced in my .25 pods. Hits hard but with air control it hits the spot. Juul can not even compare to this device imo. I Have not tried the .50s, but i'm hoping it's up to par\u000a
p1214
aVEh, idk man.  A couple things.  The \u201cjuice\u201d they used for the tanks was made by them, and I don\u2019t think they understood that the benzoic acid is used to form a salt with the nicotine freebase.  It\u2019s misleading to call it an \u201cingredient\u201d.  You aren\u2019t supposed to add more acid then can react with the nicotine.  \u000aSecond: my device has a puff and button press counter and I never domore then one second puffs at 30 watts.  Usually .9 or .8s.  And I\u2019ve used the same 30ml bottle for over a month as my only nicotine delivery system.  I would guess the doing five second puffs every sixty seconds is bad but that\u2019s be fucking insane to do that lol thatd fryrhe coil and your brain lol.  \u000aThey justmixed some lab benzo acid with some nicotine and fried it as best they could with a coil.\u000aIdk.\u000aAnd the best they got was 100, and a cig is 200,000.  I\u2019m not really convinced by this paper.\u000a\u000aI still got like 25% of a bottle of 30 ml I got a month ago.  And I vape all day its just that I don\u2019t chain vape.  Just one or two hitsevery hour and you r good.  I\u2019m telling u it\u2019s the best.  And I arguecuz i take less hits and fire coil less and for less long that I\u2019m the more healthy one then you! \u000a\u000aLol\u000a\u000aBut i got one juice and it\u2019s nasty in the tank so maybe it\u2019s dependent it\u2019s fine in juul refill but in tank so nasty but I had to fire it at 50w cuz thecoil so idk that\u2019s a bit high for the salt .\u000a\u000a\u000aAnd yeah last time I post everyone like nooo don\u2019t do it. And I said I do it anyway and I\u2019ve been had done it now and it\u2019s still goin well so yeah it\u2019s kind of a one man experiment cuz I was so curious cuz I read online say don\u2019t do it but can\u2019t find a good reason why besides: \u201cit\u2019s too much nicotine.\u201d  -.-
p1215
aVTl:Dr: If you want to keep doing it I can't stop you, and you might even be doing it in a way that's safe. Just don't suggest it to others without being extremely clear about the limitations you have to keep in check. I'm sorry about the Great Wall Of Text, but the criticism you gave of the study shows clearly that either you didn't understand the study or you don't want to understand the study. If it's the latter feel free to stop here.\u000a\u000aA1) "Levels such as these resulted in benzene being named by the 2002 National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) as the largest single known cancer-risk air toxic in the U.S.[24]. It can therefore be concluded for non-smokers that chronically repeated exposure to benzene from e-cigarettes at levels such as 100 \u03bcg/m3 will not be of negligible risk." Even if 100 was the most they got it's still a verifiable cancer hazard.\u000a\u000aA2) "for the EVOD device, values at higher power levels were as high as 5000 \u03bcg/m3"  Remember that their highest power level was 25W. That number looks a lot larger than 100\u03bcg/m3. Cigarettes are still worse, but I never said they weren't. Benzene is one of the largest carcinogens found in cigarettes, hence that 2002 accolade. Atmospheric levels are less than 1\u03bcg/m3. Note that these values come from &gt;1ohm. The heat from sub-ohming is guaranteed to make it worse.\u000a\u000aB1) That puff duration is a lot more reasonable than you think. I used to take 3 second pulls at 100W, 5 seconds at 25W would be nothing. They also didn't get it from nowhere, \u000a"Hua et al. [15] used a data mining exercise for 64 different ENDS (electronic nicotine delivery system) users on YouTube to obtain an average puff duration of 4.3 seconds ± 1.4 seconds (SD) for men, and an average of 4.0 seconds ± 0.8 seconds (SD) for women.)"\u000a\u000aB2)They directly measured the concentration on benzoic acid in Juul pods to be between 0-1mg/ml, so the made a juice consisting of 50/50 Pg/Vg, with 1mg/ml benzoic acid. They did not, as you say, "just [mix] some lab benzo acid with some nicotine and [fry] it as best they could with a coil." \u000a\u000aB3) They did the test using Juul pods + their liquid as well, and no Benzine was detected. This backs up the idea that Benzine only becomes a problem at high temperatures, where the benzoic acid can break the bond with nicotine to turn into Benzine. The juul can't get hot enough to be a problem, which is why nic salts are considered safe in them.\u000a\u000aC) liver damage is in different studies. Here's one easy to find done on rats. If, as you say, nicotine bonding with benzoic acid prevents the turn into Benzine, the benzoic acid still has to leave your body somehow after the nicotine is done, leaving you with these problems.  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308038403_IMPACTS_OF_THE_FOOD_ADDITIVE_BENZOIC_ACID_ON_LIVER_FUNCTION_OF_WISTAR_RATS\u000a\u000aA few of the effects include "atrophy [and] hyperemia".\u000a\u000aD) If doing this works for you, great. I won't ask you to change your life, there are some people who can probably sub-ohm nic salts sparsely enough to be safe. But don't go telling other people to do it. \u000aYou say you never hit for more than 1s. I know for a fact that is not typical. \u000a\u000aIf someone misunderstands you and thinks sub-ohming nic salts is totally safe to vape like normal, they could seriously get hurt, or worse.

aVA juul pod may contain as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes. But there is no way I could smoke a pack of cigarettes in a day.\u000a\u000aI go through a pack of juul pods in about a week. Anyone else do the same but could never pick up a cigarette?
p1225
aVI would go through a juul pod a day. I wasn\u2019t addicted to the nicotine I was addicted to the flavor. If your the same way I would recommend getting a refillable pod system or a mod and lower your nicotine levels. If your not addicted to the nicotine cut it out because it\u2019s a habit you don\u2019t want. 
p1226
aVWell duh, nobody is going to buy a 4-pack of Juul pods if each one only had one cigarette's worth of nicotine in it or lasted just as long. The Truth Campaign didn't even try looking into how pod systems work...

Not vaping.. We all know the 95% safer claim, and that number has since become 97%, stop trying to be responsible for someone elses life and just say "At the end of the day you're introducing things into your body that aren't naturally there, take that as you will"\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aOn top of that, most non-smoker vapers **I know** stick to 3mg nicotine at the most, and I know quite a few given I work in the industry in the UK, maybe in the US it's a different story with Juul and their confusing popularity (I've never seen a UK/EU Juul in the wild yet and they've been available here for a while now)

I\u2019ve tried different flavors and was sure to get official pods. It might be the nicotine MG but it comes on so fast I\u2019m not sure. Could be something they put in there they don\u2019t list. Who knows.\u000a\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve tried putting other juice brands in empty pods and I get none of the same symptoms. Even after taking more drags on them. I just can\u2019t seem to find any good flavors I like and I don\u2019t want to spend more money searching for something I can tolerate.\u000a\u000aI bought a SOLACE strawberry 3% start off just to see if it would be better. I didn\u2019t get any uncomfortable symptoms but its extremely pungent and taste so bad. The smell of the liquid is the worst part.\u000a\u000aNext was the SOLACE jefe 3%. Holy hell this was worse than the strawberry. It\u2019s extremely pungent and I really hate the taste. It is nauseating as well. \u000a\u000aNext was the VAPE GEAR Fleet Commander RY4 1.8% Now this is pretty good. At least it\u2019s tolerable. It\u2019s the best I\u2019ve tried from local vape shops. \u000a\u000aI did like the JUUL creme brûlée for the most part. I believe I get sort of a toffee flavor. But I can\u2019t seem to put my finger on what I like about it. Overall it was my favorite.\u000a\u000aSo overall I think I gravitate more towards a very mellow vanillaish /toffee/very very slight tobacco taste. I\u2019m open to other flavor suggestions as well I just don\u2019t know that fruity flavors are what I\u2019m looking for. The problem with the strawberry was not only that it was very pungent but it tastes so fake. Which is why I don\u2019t think fruity flavors will ever be something I\u2019d like. But again, I\u2019m open if there\u2019s flavors that don\u2019t taste so fake and powerful like bad cough syrup.\u000a\u000aJust want to get some recommendations on mellow flavors. Preferably ones that have a throat hit like the JUUL if it\u2019s possible without the 5%. \u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p1230
aVNic will make the back of your throat uncomfortable. \u000aMy guess is you're allergic to something in the juul
p1231
aVI like the throat hit. Which is why I went JUUL to begin with. But yeah either allergic or the mg it too high. Other juices however with lower nic work much better.
p1232
aVDamn, I rarely like Juuls but this makes me want to get one now.
p1233
aVElders React To Vaping (JUUL) For The First Time\u000a\u000a
p1234
aVWhy the hell would they bring people in to test the JUUL if they have never smoked before?
p1235
aVGreensmoke ceasing production\u000a\u000aWife and I have used this system for about five years. Batteries and pre-filled cartridges that screw in like a cigarette filter.\u000a\u000aApropos of nothing, the company is ceasing production citing government restrictions in the marketplace. Argh!!\u000a\u000aWith what should we replace this?  We think the Juul would suit our needs, but I wanted some feedback from this noble group. 
p1236
aVNever had a juul but my friends do. It\u2019s pretty mobile and charges quick\u000a\u000aBut the pods are a bit pricey and getting the better flavors will be difficult now too apparently 
p1237
aVSuorin is poop. Crappy flavor, equally crappy reliability.\u000a\u000aJuul isn't bad for what it is, I'd get sylo or equivalent refillable pods for it instead. The Juul flavors are, by and large, shit.\u000a\u000aSmok Novo is good but questionable reliability long term, Innokin EQ is good, Vaporesso Renova zero is also good. All refillable.
p1238
aVI used a Greensmoke kit to quit smoking. The Juul would be a great choice. If you and your wife like menthol, you'll probably like Juul's mint/menthol pods. There are many other pod systems on the market so if for some reason you don't like the Juul I would head on over to one of the major vendor websites and read some reviews of the other systems. But I think you will enjoy the Juul. If you guys plan to keep vaping indefinitely, maybe consider an upgrade that will save you money, something like the Innokin Krom-A with the Zenith tank, paired with a nic salt menthol juice of your choosing. 
p1239
aVI would look into the Mipod by Smoking Vapors,  they have a great warranty system and the Mipods themselves come in numerous different color options, they come with lanyards and keychain attachments, refillable pods that are good for about five full ups. They\u2019re very small and portable salt nicotine devices that give you the option to go tradition tobacco flavorings or to try new flavors. Buying a bottle of salt nicotine vs juul pods ends up being much cheaper in the long run. 30ml bottles of salt nicotine juices retail for about $20 bucks in my local shops(including the one I work at) with the pods selling for just under $5. Juul pods around me range from $15-20 for 4 pods. You get 7.5 ml of juice in every 4 pod pack compared to a bottle of salt nicotine juice costing you $20 for 30ml. So it\u2019s about $100 to get the same of amount of eliquid as a regular 30ml bottle of juice. If prefilled pod systems are your go to the PHIX might be another viable option for you as well. 
p1240
aVI don't have a JUUL myself, but from what I know, it's a very high nicotine content and they do have a methol flavor. They're not shaped like a cigarette, but they're roughly the same length, they look like a USB drive
p1241
aVLooks like wifey will try to stop I clutch mine in my hand whilst sleeping. \u000a\u000aMight have to take a longish taper.  I\u2019ll keep the Juul on my list. Thank you!
p1242
aVI literally taste almost nothing with juul mango pods now, the only one that still does it for me is mint
p1243
aVRebuildable for nicotine salts?\u000a\u000aTitle says it all for the most part. Got a juul a couple weeks back and I've since fallen in love with nic salts. Was hoping to find a good alternative to it as I've come to love the device itself but I just can't find anything that fits my needs. Looking to find a highly reccomended mtl rda for my salts! Preferably squonkable as I have a pulse 80w already but not necessary! Appreciate any input! 
p1244
aVIf u want a salt nic vape just get a juul. In my experienxe they have the best throat hit and feel the most like a cig in terms on nic buzz and throat hit.
p1245
aVI mean I seriously wasn\u2019t joking. As a smoker, in my opinion the juul feels the closest thing to a cig there is. i\u2019ve tried numerous other salt nic devices and none have had the throat hit that a juul has.
p1246
aVSuorin Drop vs Smok Nord\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve been juuling for a few months now and I\u2019m getting tired of spending so much money on pods, plus I can\u2019t buy mango anywhere now. I have a few friends who have the suorin drop so I kind of had my heart set on getting one. My boyfriend recently got a SMOK Nord and I\u2019m really liking how it hits. Just looking for some guidance/advice on which product I should get.
p1247
aV\u201cJuuling\u201d. How old are you?
p1248
aVThere are non juul brand pre filled as well as refillable pods a bit cheaper. \u000aUltimately its an issue of user preference. It sounds like you have access to both. Try them and see which you like better. Be sure to also consider the cost of replacement pods. 
p1249
aVI feel like I\u2019m just done with the juul. Now that I know there are better products out there with a better range of flavors I\u2019m ready for a new device. It seems like the Nord might end up being cheaper because you only have to replace the coil which you can aparently get 5 for $20
p1250
aVAhh okay!!  Hope no offense was taken. But you\u2019d be surprised the number of underage that try to come on here. It\u2019s a problem and the term you used is common amongst teens. \u000a\u000aHonestly as much as I hate smok I\u2019ve heard some good things on the novo. I\u2019m not a big pod system guy but my boss almost exclusively uses them. For open systems I\u2019ve heard great things about the novo and the drop (nothing yet on the nord). Also the lost vape Orion is great.\u000a\u000aPersonally I\u2019ve had the Suorin Vagon and drop and the Vagon I liked a bit more. Also you don\u2019t see them often but the ops 1 from smoke joy is excellent. \u000a\u000aIf you\u2019re looking for something better than the juul in a closed pod system I\u2019d look at the Juno. It\u2019s the only closed pod I recommend to anyone!
p1251
aVI think I\u2019m pretty much done with closed pod systems. I like the drop because of the size and how it hits similar to the juul. The Nord is bigger and heavier but still fits in the palm of your hand. The Nord also hits a lot heavier which I like. I\u2019ll definitely look into the ones you recommended!
p1252
aVHonestly, I\u2019m sitting here hitting my juul after using the Nord for a bit and I feel like I\u2019m leaning heavily towards getting the Nord. I guess I was just looking to see if there were any major negatives against either product/brand.
p1253
aVIs this true?\u000a\u000a"A single JUUL pod (a cartridge of vape liquid) contains as much\u000a\u000anicotine as a pack of cigarettes, or 200 cigarette puffs." via [https://publichealthinsider.com/2018/08/28/not-just-water-vapor-why-e-cigarettes-are-so-dangerous/](https://publichealthinsider.com/2018/08/28/not-just-water-vapor-why-e-cigarettes-are-so-dangerous/) \u000a\u000aI am not sure if this is true. Just to make sure, reddit, can you tell me?
p1254
aV1. You don't vape a whole Juul pod in sitting. \u000a2. Diacetyl was found in some ejuices (only about 6 juices were tested, all varied in quantity). \u000a3. At this current point in time vaping is safer than smoking cigarettes. \u000a\u000aIgnore things like this. Half of these articles are not credible and are heavily biased. Studies have shown that vaping is currently safer than smoking cigarettes. Currently, vaping cannot be deemed 100% safe as we don't know it's long term affects. \u000a\u000aTests showed that the vapour is no different to breathing in normal air in a house. \u000a\u000aAny article published by the UK government will be highly credible as vaping is legal, embraced &amp; encouraged. 
p1255
aVYou can estimate it with math. Juul pods are .7 mL of 50 mg / mL juice, so each one should have about 35 mg of nicotine. The average cigarette has 4-8 mg of nicotine and there are 20 in a pack, meaning there's 80 -160 mg of nicotine total. This doesn't account for absorbtion differences, which complicate the conversion 
p1256
aVHow old are you? \u000a\u000aAside from that, a juul pod is, according to juul, equivalent to a pack of cigarettes, yes. 
p1257
aVThere\u2019s A TON of good options. \u000a\u000aAspire has the breeze 2 and Nautilus AIO which are good.\u000a\u000aSuorins would be closer to the juul as they are draw activated and a disposable pod so less maintenance. I like the Vagon the most personally. \u000a\u000aAlso the lost vape Orion is incredible.
p1258
aVLost vape Orion story\u000a\u000aOk so a little about me first. I\u2019ve been vaping for about 5 years now so I\u2019ve used a ton of different devices and tanks/rdas. I started out at 24mg juice before subohm tanks started to take off then I pretty much had to go down to 6mg to avoid destroying my throat. I only use RDAs now (dead rabbit is still my favorite after a year and a half of using it) and I have a voopoo vmate (worst designed device I\u2019ve used but it works well and feels sturdy enough). \u000a\u000aAnyways on to the story. I was at my cousins wedding over the weekend and I left my vape in the hotel room so I went a few hours without vaping so I was kinda itching to get it. Before I decided to go back to the room, my friend pulls out the Orion he purchased a few weeks back and let\u2019s me take a hit. Well if you insist, I will take a puffy puff. So I start hitting it like it\u2019s a regular device, knowing full well that it\u2019s a salt nic device and I will get a pretty good buzz off it. It was a surprisingly smooth hit, unlike Juuls which would have destroyed my throat if I took a hit like that. I then proceed to let off the power button and inhale the vapor sitting in my cheeks, like I would with an RDA. Oh boy. Instant and most insane buzz I\u2019ve ever had in my life. I was just standing there and my vision turned white for a good 5 seconds and I couldn\u2019t move. I used to dip and the only time I\u2019ve ever gotten close to that was when I packed a full bottom lip (horseshoe for the initiated). It went away after about 45 seconds, as buzzes do, but those were a crazy 45 seconds.\u000a\u000aSo if you were on the edge about getting the Orion, hope I pushed you over. I personally try to avoid salt nic because I\u2019m fine at 6mg freebase juice, but if I were a salt nic fiend I would 100% buy an Orion. Also, this isn\u2019t an ad for lostvape, they just make very good devices. I had a Therion and Paranormal and they were both very nice but unfortunately the DNA chip took a crap on both of them and I don\u2019t feel like sending them out to Evolv.\u000a
p1259
aVDisclaimer, I am a former pack-a-day smoker who switched to vaping around 3 years ago. I continue to vape (and occasionally smoke, yes...) because I enjoy it. I try to be respectful about it, treating it like tobacco use in public. I don't vape indoors unless explicitly told I can, and otherwise try to be discreet.\u000a\u000aThat said, if you don't already smoke or otherwise use tobacco products, I am reluctant to recommend vaping. While current literature indicates that vaping is safer than smoking, we still don't really have data on the long-term effects. \u000a\u000aTeenagers deciding that Juuls are suddenly cool have forced the FDA to go to great lengths to restrict access to certain products, even for adult vapers. Also, the Truth anti-vaping ads are obnoxious as hell...\u000a\u000aSeriously, teenagers, stop vaping. If you want to ruin your health, switch back to energy drinks.
p1260
aVHow\u2019s the flavor on it? \u000a\u000aI want one because the Juul pods are disgustingly overpriced 
p1261
aVThe flavor\u2019s great. I read on here that this juice is the best substitute for the Juul mango pods &amp; I knew naked 100 had a good reputation. \u000aI go through a half a pod a day, &amp; they last 4-5, I\u2019ve read, so I figure that\u2019s like $4 a week to buy a new one. 
p1262
aVI really like it, but it\u2019s my 1st pod system so I\u2019ve just got the juul to compare it to. 
p1263
aVJuul to box mod nicotine levels\u000a\u000afor the past year and a half I\u2019ve been juuling I go through about 2 pods a week. I had a t priv with a tfv-8 at one point but I sold it regrettably. I love box mods everything about them is so cool. I\u2019m gonna quit juuling and go back to a box mod here soon. What nicotine level do you guys run in your mods? I know 3 is the usual but is running 9-12 too harsh considering the difference in smoke production between a juul and mod?
p1264
aVHave since stepped down but when I switched over from Juul I used 6 and didn\u2019t notice any cravings etc...

aVGet a juul or a  OVNS - JC01 and use the JC01 refillable CBD pods. \u000a\u000aWill work better for CBD than any cheap mod or vape pen. \u000a\u000aCotton wicks (like the ones in the smok x8 coils) are really shitty for CBD. \u000a\u000aYou need something with a ceramic wick/element like the JC01 pods have.

aVCan I use Salt Nic in any vape?\u000a\u000aI want to get stronger nicotine juice but I was told I\u2019d need to buy something like a juul or suorin to handle Salt Nic, but I already have a vape and I don\u2019t want to spend extra money if I don\u2019t need to. I have the Eleaf basal, I don\u2019t really know much about it so here\u2019s a link to its page so you can get whatever info you need to answer my question. Thanks\u000a\u000ahttps://www.eleafus.com/basal-kit.html
p1269
aVYikes. Can't have leakage... Man... I am so torn on pod devices. Hopefully this one works well enough for me to not keep going back to the Juul. I appreciate the response!
p1270
aVwtf is going on with juul pods?\u000a\u000aI noticed since last week that the color of the fluid inside the cartridge has changed from light yellow to nearly clear. Quite a noticable difference. It also now says 3.0% nicotine... is that what it was before? did they take it down a step? I could swear it's not cutting it for me anymore... I'm vaping a lot more and not getting the nicotine buzz??
p1271
aVWhat is more dangerous? A small pod vape or a big mod device?\u000a\u000aI feel like it would be the big mod, since so much more vapor goes into the lungs, however pod devices like the juul have a lot more nicotine. What do you think?\u000a\u000aP.S. I am a freshman in college who has vaped since freshman year of high school, and want to quit over the winter break. I use 25 nic in my pod and am going down to 15 soon. However, it might be too hard for me to quit cold turkey when almost all my friends have a vape. What do you think is the best way to quit? I was thinking about using the gum.
p1272
aVMods that can support Salt Nicotine?\u000a\u000aI use a juul and it\u2019s getting expensive going through a pod a day, does refilling work or will it leak? I read that salt nicotine is not safe to use with high wattage and sub ohms. If I got a variable wattage mod and set it to ~16watts with a 1.6ohm coil with salt nictone would that be safe and equivalent to a juul? I\u2019m planning on getting 45-50mg nic juice instead of the 59mg in juuls. Or should I buy a juulalike
p1273
aVAnd they call a Juul a USB stick\u000a\u000a
p1274
aVSmok Novo\u000a\u000aPicked up a Smok Novo to come off the Juul (pricey here). Not sure when to replace the pod. The vapor production is okay still and flavor still okay at 5 days. There is some brown coloring around the bottom of the cotton, the salt nic being clear. When should it be changed? 
p1275
aVHow does it compare to Juul? I wanted one but I don\u2019t want any more vapor production. Also, what mg nic salt do you use?
p1276
aVSo far so good actually. Quit cigs in August with the Juul, but with its popularity growing, the price for pods is at 25$ (in Philadelphia including tax). So my gf had an old pen vape laying around I tried that for a day and 6 was no where near enough. What I really liked about the Juul was its ease of use, discrete use, and similarity to cigs, also the throat hit. Went to the vape shop and the guy recommended the Smok Novo. The pod is larger, holding more juice. He recommended a mint flavor or a fruit flavor with ice (menthol) to help with the throat hit. So far so good. Have 35mg. Def puts off more vapor too. Nic salt runs like 18-20$ for 30ml. Pods are 3/18$ at least at my shop. So def saving money on it. I feel like it hits better and the drags are smoother. Battery life about the same as Juul. Flavor more consistent too I feel like the Juul pods would suck sometimes and the hits wouldn\u2019t be that great. Def Novo&gt; Juul 
p1277
aVNever mind. Thing took a shit on me. Did nothing to it filled a pod the other day and I plugged the pod back in and it started firing without me hitting it and wouldn\u2019t stop. So back to the Juul I go. Probs gonna just refill Juul pods with juice and that\u2019ll solve my money problems \u000a
p1278
aVIdk if the promo still going on, I ordered it through a ad pop-up. The kit priced at $20 but you only pay $1 + your state tax (I live in CA so its like $5), total $6 still a big bang for the bucks since the pod can be tweaked to refill like juul. 
p1279
aVIt's pretty decent imo, bigger capacity than juul and airflow not as restricted. At 2.4% nicotine they give a way better throat-hit than juul 3% pods. Their tobacco pod that went with the kit also taste better than juul tobacco pods, nice honey caramel taste. If Blu gonna be serious about this device, I can easily see it would take phix's position as juul biggest rival.

p1282
aVAnything juul is never cool. Over priced kid addicting BS company. Dont hate vapes, hate the juul
p1283
aVUh, wat. Don't hate on Juul. Are adults not allowed to enjoy fruity flavors? 
p1284
aVThe main reason people hate on vaping in general is because of juul. Truth ads are all 100% because of juul because kids decided to mass buy them. Everything that is wrong with vaping came from juul
p1285
aVDon't hate the juul hate shitty parents unable to punish and legitimately control their children to the point where they deem it nesssicary to take things away from everyone or big tobacco. They never fucking banned cigarettes because kids were smoking them yet that happens at a higher rate than underage vaping. The juul has definitely helped tons of people quit smoking cigarettes. You have misplaced anger. 
p1286
aVAnd whos fault is that? Juul for making a solid product and pretty much creating an entire segment of vaping, or the dumbasses who work in gas stations and convenience stores that aren't carding these kids? 
p1287
aVWe need to distance our self from juul or people will never respect people who vape as equal to smokers and non. Supporting juul == supporting hate
p1288
aVPeople were giving those of us who vape shit long before JUUL. As far as I know JUUL has in no way actively marketed towards kids and we should be standing with any vaping company that's coming under attack because parents aren't paying attention to their kids and shop owners/online retailers aren't obtaining legit identification. First they came for the JUUL and I did not speak up because I used box mods, then they came for the RDAs and I did not speak up because I used a tank, then they came for my vape, and there was no one left in the industry to speak up for me
p1289
aVThey really haven't. Juul became popular with kids because of their availability and because their quality. Those same kids would've been buying cigarettes from the same gas stations they bought their Juuls at, and I'm speaking from personal experience. Juul was never and isn't the problem, we have to show that big tobacco and lack of responsibility from clerks are the cause. 
p1290
aVFor real, going after Juul and similar products is literally going after the most effective ways of quitting cigarettes. I've seen more people successfully transition off of cigarettes using pod systems than I have ANY OTHER kind of vape. 
p1291
aVThis is not true,i know for a fact most people who dont vape would rather you be hitting a juul then a mod if you where standing right next to them,and they make decent juice especially Virginia tobacco imo,the only reason i stopped useing juul is because the inconsistency of the hits.but i dont know why you hate them they've helped 1000s of adults quit cigs.
p1292
aVTo be honest i personaly think the truth is from bigtobbaco,becuse even bad advertisement is still advertising and when smokers see it it will likely trigger them to smoke by just hearing the word smoke and in the commercial saying juul pod contains as much nicotine as a pack a cigs is definitely advertising becuse allot of adults say 30-40 years of age dont even know vape juice contains nicotine

aVNice! I just recently made the switch from a juul too lol no regrets
p1296
aVI'd get him a juul to start off. Maintenance free, hits more like a cig, and satisfies cravings. I quit a 40 yr habit in two days with juul. Then I tried the aspire breeze so I could pick flavors and reduce nic levels.  but changing coils was a pain plus a myriad of other issues. Recently moved on to smok novo. No coils to change and easy to fill.  Only 2 weeks on the novo but like it so far.
p1297
aVNeed recommendations for a cigarette smoker\u000a\u000aWant to get my friend a vape set up. He's 23 and has been smoking cigarettes since the age of 15 to 16. He smokes Marlboro menthols. He is one stubborn f*co. I've been trying for over 2 years to get him to try vaping but wont nudge. He's gotten the joy aio, nothing. Surrin air, juul nothing. Got him a juul starter pack, nothing. I recently got a hastur mini rta, and he seems to enjoy it when I let use it at 15w to 20w. Probably going to get him that for Christmas. How do you get someone who has been smoking for a long time to transition to vaping, everyone I know gave up on him.
p1298

aVOnly things I've ever had leak were a smok tfv8 my friend gave me (used once and after having sat for about a week litterally everything had leaked out onto the shelf it was on) and juul pods. Squonk/rda combo hasnt leaked a drop ever. 
p1301
aVFor pod, you can get a juul. Similar to a cigarette. Doesn\u2019t require a lot of work.\u000a\u000aFor vape starter kit, you can try OBS Cube Kit. Built in battery and has everything you need inside.
p1302
aVHead hurts after vaping\u000a\u000aIt's been a week or so since I last hit my juul. I just did and got a small buzz. now my head hurts and i don't feel super good. how do i make this stop?
p1303
aVYa don't vape the juul anymore and you can try laying down for a bit with your eyes closed and keep hydrated.  Should kick it
p1304
aVI highly suggest the Lost Vape Orion, it\u2019s a little pricey (50-75$) depending where you buy it, but it\u2019s a small, discreet device that will be all you\u2019ll ever need. I\u2019ve spent 200+ dollars on 10-12 pod based devices similar to juul before I got this, and I swear you will love it. As far as juice goes, it\u2019s different for everyone, you\u2019ll just have to experiment with different flavors and nicotine strengths. Do your research and ask around, but almost anyone that owns one will tell you the same thing I have.
p1305
aVWhy Knock offs are better then Juul\u000a\u000a
p1306
aVBecause, aside from being an incredibly stupid name, \u201crip stick\u201d is already a trademarked product name. And the name \u201cJuul\u201d, or a stylized form of \u201cjewel\u201d, made sense in the original generation where the cutout by the pod was diamond shaped.\u000a\u000aNot to defend juul tho. They are the scourge of the industry and absolute trash. 
p1307
aVThanks for the suggestions, side note, I went in today and their prices are INSANE 20$ for juul pods 28$ for phix 32$ for jam monster, the guys only selling inflated prices to kids it\u2019s right next to a bar that regularly has younger smokers/vapers and I never see anyone but kids go in there cause the prices are crazy
p1308
aVOf course man. I work in a shop and I can\u2019t tell you how satisfying it is to turn down minors. It both protects our industry and satisfies my evil love of pissing off kids. \U0001f923\u000a\u000aYea there\u2019s a town near me that\u2019s 18+ and surrounded by towns that are 21+ and the 18+ shop jacks up prices because they know the kids will come to buy since they don\u2019t have options. Super fucked up if you ask me.\u000a\u000aAlso juul is going to be going up in price everywhere now.
p1309
aVIve used the juul, aspire breeze, as sourin drop. The Orion blows them all away by far.

aVThe Tesla Punk 85 has been awesome for the past year but I dropped it and the fire is a little fucked but it still works great\u000a\u000aJuul is pretty decent but I wouldn\u2019t swap the Punk for it\u000a
p1312
aVSo I work in sales and was a heavy pack a day smoker for 4 years. One day I smelled so heavily of smoke that a customer thought a car we were test driving had been smoked in, so I decided to give kicking that shit a shot.\u000a\u000aI had originally planned to pick up a little Juul but a buddy of mine that works at a local shop hooked me up with the Novo and some juice and man, I love this thing.\u000a\u000a2 weeks of using this and I\u2019m down from a pack a day of Camels to 1 a day (if that). It\u2019s seriously great. I don\u2019t smell anymore, I don\u2019t wake up coughing, and overall I just feel better. Best $30 I\u2019ve ever spent, hands down. 
p1313
aVThe Boulder Rock is my backup/stealth pod. The Orion is my go to now, done with Juuls, subohm and other stuff. It just works and works well.
p1314
aVI mean the same company who makes the Juul make a an extremely similar pen for thc oil cartridges that might be compatible with the juuls. But it is incredibly stupid still
p1315
aVNot a juul insight
p1316
aVI'm using the saurin air now that I've kicked the Juul and it's really good so far, the pods are 5 dollars in my area and don't leak for a good while
p1317
aVHonestly it sounds like your body is just reacting to the increase of nicotine (heart palpitations), and the sore throat could be something as simple as a normal reaction since you're new to vaping. I don't remember having a sore throat, but heart palpitations definitely still hit me sometimes if I rip a JUUL pod 3 or 4 times. Like someone else mention here, I would continue to monitor it and speak to a doctor if the symptoms get any worse.
p1318
aVanti-vaping propaganda at The Game Awards tonight\u000a\u000awhat the fuck was that they had all these ads playing during it saying "vaping is 4x more likely to lead you to smoking cigarettes" and "1 Juul pod is equivalent to smoking 20 cigarettes"\u000a\u000awho the fuck are these clueless idiots?
p1319
aVBut doesn't big tobacco own a lot of vape stuff? Like Juul has been getting trashed on. (If only they knew other pod systems exsisted)
p1320
aVThey don't own Juul yet, but one of them is planning to snap it up soon... even so, it's the only way they can advertise, and they know it works. It's all quite warped.
p1321
aVQuestion regarding making my own salt nicotine e liquid\u000a\u000aIf i take 100mg/ml raw nicotine salt juice and combine it with regular juice at 50/50 concentration, will that give me a 50mg/ml solution of e-liquid or is that an oversimplification of how it really works? I will be using this liquid for the purpose of refilling juul pods and also with a low wattage MTL vape. Thanks!
p1322
aVNewbie question\u000a\u000aSo I recently got a Juul and been wondering about getting Ejuice to refill the pods, Instead of going to the gas station and spending like $30 on pods each time. I have a few questions\u000a\u000a1. I've seem this ejuice 30ml 5% nicotine, does that mean 5% nicotine in the bottle or 5% per ml, very confused.\u000a\u000a2. If I were to buy the juice and use it to refill pods, how much nioctine would I get each time I refilled the pod. (Can hold .7ml).
p1323
aVjuul pods are 50mg salt nic. you can get get 50mg salt nic at most vape shops in the US
p1324
aVThere are some 3rd party companies now selling Juuls stuff. Here's the thing, if the shop already sells Juuls, they are technically not allowed to sell those 3rd party accessories, it's against the terms that Juuls sets up with their vendors.\u000a\u000a  \u000aYour best bet is to find a shop that doesn't carry Juuls, you'll then find the items you need at much more affordable prices. As with everything in life, ymmv...
p1325
aVWhat\u2019s the point in Juul?\u000a\u000aI\u2019m just wondering as they\u2019re really expensive for what they are. You can get a decent sub ohm mod box thing for the same price or cheaper and it\u2019s a million times better! Bigger clouds, more flavor and flavor options, and have interchangeable batteries.\u000a\u000aSo yeah... what\u2019s the deal, man?
p1326
aVA lot of juul users I\u2019ve talked to and met seem to be really stubborn when it comes to actual vaping (Purely an anecdote). Especially when juul came out with that statement where they would discontinue flavored pods for that short while, a bunch of my friends said fuck it and went back to smoking after being a week/a month of off smoking. Tried to introduce them to pod systems like the novo (which I have) but to them they view filling the pods as \u201ctoo much of a hassle\u201d. To them it is easier to buy pre-filled pods at a gas station or a vape shop. They are lazy, but this doesn\u2019t account for other juul users.
p1327
aVI used to use one before they started selling bottles of salt nic juice locally. The juice is very satisfying, and it\u2019s really easy to use for newbies. Especially now with how popular it is, Im sure a lot of smokers who don\u2019t know anything about vaping have seen the juul at the gas station and end up getting it because it\u2019s there and they know a lot of people like it. With all of the alternatives that look and feel like the juul but have refillable pods, I really don\u2019t get paying the extra money for the juul.. but my wife just went back to the juul from the sourin drop, and has tried a lot of others and gone back to juul because she says she gets dry hits, very quickly burnt coils, and juice in mouth with everything else. I think it\u2019s operator error, but maybe others have experienced that as well and that leads them to go back to the juul.
p1328
aVThe established way of using vaping to stop smoking is by starting at a high level - for me that was 18mg in an Nautilus - and you wean yourself down over time. Had a mate that couldn't get vaping to stick because the nature of his job means he didn't have time to sit and huff a subohm tank with 6mg for long enough at a time to not want a cigarette any more. Bought a Juul on a whim and now hasn't had a fag in over a year. He switched to the Minifit a few months back to be able to get access to more flavors than just Juul pods. 
p1329
aVSo Juul is like McDonald\u2019s? Everyone goes there for the convenience but there\u2019s much better options round the corner? \U0001f602
p1330
aVThat's correct, you don't want to drop nic levels quickly at all. Then next the nic level of the juice doesn't tell us anything about how much of that nic gets into the blood stream over time. The Juul is a tootle device with at best moderate vapor production (in comparison to a dual coil RDA), it's got to have pretty high nic to be effective at all.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aAnd a happy "red rocket" to "i\u005c_wank\u005c_dogs" I guess :D
p1331
aVI used juul to help me quit chewing and dipping. I think it was largely the convenience of the whole thing, especially since I work at a convenience store chain haha. It's right there, lightweight, and did the job at the time.
p1332
aVThe nicotine content is a lot more satisfying to heavy smokers than something like a 6mg juice. Juuls are easy to use and are pretty well known. They are a bit expensive for what they are though. 
p1333
aV1) Sub-ohm vaping isn't for everyone. people don't want to carry a mod (even a tube is bulky in the pocket) and a tank that could leak. I have 2 mods and a juul and I only ever take my juul and an extra pod when i'm out of the house. And  to be honest, i don't want to turn into  a human fog machine when I'm out in public. flavor and vape production is less important to me than nicotine delivery.  And who wants to carry batteries and/or an external charger around. \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a2) Pod systems in general are great for on the go vaping. But juul has an advatage of being available at gas stations and convenience stores. If im bar hopping or spending the night at my girls place and I run out, I can simply run around the block to get some pods instead of waiting for vapemail.  \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a3) The nicotine content and throat hit you get from a juul or nic salt devices in general is more akin to a cigarette. I found it more effective in terms of helping me quit as I was still smoking a few cigs when i got my first mod (though I cut down a lot).  \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a4) No one wants to be seen in public ripping fat clouds with a box. as much as i love my mods, i think it looks ridiculous. Juuls look sleeker and minimalist.  People take note, including celebrities The fact that celebrities have been seen juuling signals to consumers that it's cool and hip and gets even more smokers (and teens) to pick juuls up instead of a mod. 
p1334
aVconvenience is a huge issue when consumers purchase things like vapes. If your friends novo pod goes bad, he/she can't go to a store (maybe a few vape shops). Juuls are enticing because, like cigs, they're sold everywhere.
p1335
aVVaping on freebase nicotine on a SMOK novo\u000a\u000aListen I'm including this since nicotine is technically a drug. Okay, so I just got a SMOK  Novo, and I didnt know weather or not it's okay for me to use freebase nicotine. The only thing I've found is for using freebase in juul, juul and the novo are pretty different so I just want to make sure. The main question is, is it okay to use a freebase 6mg nic in a Novo
p1336
aVDoes juul delivery require signature.\u000a\u000aI bought a juul off of www.allpuffsusa.com and was wondering if it needs a signature. I live in Los Angeles the carrier is USPS. I'm paranoid because I'm 19 but I look like a sophomore.

p1339
aVHow did you do that to your Juul?
p1340
aVI rarely like engraved juuls but damn, that\u2019s pretty dude!! 
p1341
aVBro I think they also do custom engravings for you. Not sure if they do for all mods tho. I know for sure they do it for Juul. https://engraze.com/custom/
p1342
aVDamn juuls are like $25 where I live. 
p1343
aVI believe it\u2019s just a case you put around your Juul. You would still have to buy your own separately still.
p1344
aVDamn Juuls are $60 where I live. (Kit and in CAD)
p1345
aVLet me hit that juul bro just once i beg
p1346
aVSame. \u2014 But other salt nic devices exist, and much better juices out there that aren\u2019t made with 10% benzoic acid (which can cause lose of sight or smell). Check out the Suorin air, the pull is also much better than Juul.
p1347
aVIts not in all salt nicotine. Juul uses it as an alternative to PG.
p1348
aVI use the myblu because it has a very long battery life and is slimmer and more rounded than the juul. I rewick the pods as the base just comes off, not glued or anything, and the cotton is right there. The pods that come with it are 24mg freebase and don't taste very good, but it is a very good hit on a fresh wick with 50mg saltnic, and if you wick right you'll never get a burnt hit or leakage.
p1349
aVSince I can't get a Juul, what's the second best vape for quiting ciggarettes?\u000a\u000aDue to the meanness of the Juul company, I can't get one because I live outside of the US. I NEED to quit smoking, I've literally tried every possible way and it didn't work. I know I could quit with a good vape because I had a Kanger and quit for two solid weeks until my juice finished... Please help me, I need this!
p1350
aVWell, in what country do you live? Depending on what the maximum legal amount of nicotine in your area is the suitable devices will vary. If you want to quit in a short time then you need access to enough nicotine in your vape, a very small device (juul size) with 18mg/ml might not be enough.
p1351
aVAll devices are available online and can be shipped to my doorstep, the only vape that has these kinds of restrictions is the Juul.
p1352
aVIf you want a buzz the Juul has you covered lol
p1353
aVHere's how I quit smoking (2.5 pack a day for 49 yrs): As of this writing, I'm 3.5 weeks without a cigarette with no nicotine cravings.\u000a\u000a1. 2 Juul batteries (or more as needed to always have a charged battery)\u000a2. Ref-Pods (formerly known as J-Pods)- empty fillable pods. I only count on 1 fill, but sometimes get up to 3.\u000a3. Your Favorite Nic-Salt. Mine is Yami Turoto 35mg.\u000a\u000aThe details:\u000a\u000a1.  Juul is designed to simulate an analog cig. It uses a mouth to lung design. There's a little bit of practice to draw on it in a way that's satisfying to you. I was using a direct to lung pod/salt-nic device before which became too costly. Also, I needed high nic for satisfaction. When I switched to Juul, I had to switch to low nic because the nicotine absorption to my body was much greater- which is good.\u000a2. I first tried Juul's creme brûlée which I found disgusting. I found the ref-pod which works great.\u000a3. When I first started vaping back in '07, I stuck with tobacco flavors for familiarity and the food flavors I tried were terrible ( think vaping Jolly Rancher). I eventually went back to cigs. Salt-Nicotine is the game changer. It's different chemistry- look it up. Salt-Nic is more satisfying and feels more like nicotine from a real cigarette. \u000a\u000aWith more sophisticated flavors, I advise getting away from tobacco flavor completely. When I ran out of my favorite Turoto, I loaded up some tobacco flavor I had (and thought I liked a few months prior) and now found it terrible. You'll be surprised how your taste changes.\u000a\u000aThe bottom line: The throat hit from the Juul + a salt-nic  flavor I really like was the key. I can't imagine going back to cigarettes- and I never thought I'd feel this way about it. \u000a\u000aThere are still some minor cravings for physical smoke. I satisfy those cravings with non-tobacco/nicotine substances. \u000a\u000aI currently vape around 4 pods a day.\u000a\u000a
p1354
aVlevel up vapor ejuice review\u000a\u000aAfter a while of seeing good reviews for level up vapor's nic salts (mostly from r/juul) I decided to give them a try. I was kind of apprehensive and worried that the reviews weren't totally honest since nearly all of them were so positive but I gave it a shot. I bought a bottle of blue raspberry and mango, both 50mg, a few weeks ago.   \u000a\u000a\u000aI've been using them in my suorin air and have loved them both so far. Blue raspberry kind of reminds me of a blue jolly rancher, with a very slight cooling feeling on the inhale. Not like a menthol though. The cool feeling went away after a while of vaping, maybe because I'm just used to the flavor now.   \u000aThe mango tastes very similar to a real mango, and it's much different from the Juul mango flavor which tastes more artificial to me. It's also kind of like a peachy candy flavor.   \u000aThe flavors aren't extremely strong, but I don't expect as much flavor from nic salts, especially from using a suorin. I've used both flavors for weeks and haven't noticed them burning my pods out any sooner. They last about 2-3 weeks, which is typical. Before trying level up I used naked 100 lava flow, which wasn't bad at all, just not my type of flavor. I also tried mr. salt e blue raspberry lemonade, but there was barely any flavor to me and it burned my pods faster.   \u000a\u000a\u000aThen I tried refilling empty juul pods with the level up, and didn't have a good experience at all. It leaked so much and would barely hit. I figured maybe it's just this particular pod or I didn't refill right (despite refilling pods for a while and never having issues). I tried again with 3 other pods but still had the leaking issue. Maybe it's just me but trying to use level up for my juul wasn't a good experience.   \u000aOverall though, I'd recommend them if anyone's looking to try new nic salt flavors. I haven't ordered any other flavors but I plan on trying more eventually. 
p1355
aVThey couldn't have given the guy a big stacked mech with quad coil rda. He didnt blow much more cloud than the juul guy. Not that I'm a clouds guy, they just undersold it a bit.

aVAs long as you get a working one you\u2019ll love it\u2026it has MTL &amp; DL pods and fully charged in 25 minutes it\u2019s a bit bigger &amp; thicker than a juul but I actually like that because it makes it feel more quality to me 
p1359
aVJuul flavors have been taken from stores and Distros entirely. I work for one. Last week we got our last stock to the vape shops. They are no longer available. So you cannot purchase any pods from brick and mortar locations.\u000a\u000aJuul has also won a patent case. Meaning Phix, and other pod systems like it habe been sued and received a cease and desist order. This has put any company making a Juul shaped device under duress.\u000a\u000aYou can only obtain Juul Pods from their website, after age verification.

aVThe CVA accepts donations from Big Tobacco\u000a\u000aWhen you've been actively advocating for vaping, and you find out that the Canadian Vaping Association is accepting "platinum donations" from British Owned Tobacco. Makes you think are they really fighting for Canadian Vapers Rights? As they made sure Blu was accepted to the Canadian market, I guess Juuls cheque wasnt as big.... Time after time, the CVA snubs off the general public, and their decisions are made behind closed doors. Yes anyone can be a member, but the memberships are on a selection basis. So it's a private club essentially, and that offers nothing positive to the Canadian Vaping Industry, except for their own terms.  Now I have reached out a few times, to ask questions. To only be turned away, as I am not a member. That is fine, as I'm a nobody with no deep pockets. What I am is an active vape advocate, that stands besides other amazing members of this Canadian vape community.\u000a\u000aSo I ask you, what message is the CVA saying to all the hard working advocates? What do they think of all the hard working community members, that put themselves out every day.

aVAspire AIO salt nic level\u000a\u000aI just ordered an Aspire Nautilus AIO but I don't know which kind of salt to get.  I haven't used salts before but I tried a juul and I really am wanting to switch to mouth to lung.  Would you do a 30mg or 50mg with the nautilus?
p1364
aVI don't know what I'll do with the other coil yet.  Im new to salts and pod vaping but I'm giving it a go and I'll have to figure out my preferences.  Since I've tried the juul I've wanted to emulate the hit of a real cigarette instead of huge clouds in sub ohm builds.  I honestly even haven't quit smoking yet so I'm hoping salts are what do it for me.
p1365
aVBeen out the game, looking for lightweight mods\u000a\u000aI've only been using salt nicotine, juuls and the my, but got frustrated with the my when the pods I picked up didn't fit well and the draw was super tight. I vaped for a while before the juul, I've got a drag and a falcon with mesh coils, I want a light weight mod as my drag is ugly now and the charging port sucks (I know get a battery charging bay you dimwit). I also plan on getting a resin falcon, to see how light I can get my setup. But I also want a quality mod that isn't gonna look ugly in two months. So help me out, what mod should I upgrade to?
p1366
aVMade the switch from freebase nicotine to nic salts about a year and a half ago with the juul, and have bought/followed most of the newest pod mods as they\u2019ve come out. Every single one having issues or problems that I couldn\u2019t overlook. \u000a\u000aI\u2019ve been waiting for the build quality in pod mods to reach that of what we have with regular mods, and I really think the Orion is the first major game changer taking those steps. I know there\u2019s been issues with the DNA chip, but even if this thing eventually dies out on me, it gives me hope that other companies already have plans designing nic salt devices that are of this quality.
p1367
aVIs this MTL like the Juul and would I be able to use 0mg juice in this.

p1375
aVWith as little cotton as those pods have, that'd start tasting terrible pretty fast. Depends if you use the same juice, how often you use it, etc. Rough guess that it'd be pretty unfavorable after 3-5 refills. Stop trying to "hack" Juul and just get a good (even decent) nic salt device.

aVFudge I was trying to find the article I was ready yesterday that was on study about how the amount of carcinogens is nearly cut in half in the first week of switching to vaping from smoking. And at two weeks it's something like 60 percent. The measured this in urine I do believe looking for certain metabolites. It's alright the same thing happened in the 90s when GM released the EV1 (first kinda mass production electric vehicle for the masses.) Everyone with their hand in the oil cookie jar got it shut down with all sorts of bullshit and now because of popular demand evs are everywhere. I imagine a similar thing will happen with vaping. Well a similar thing it will grow in such popularity. All I can say is it's most certainly the lesser of two evils. Kids are man you tell them no they say yes, I know I was certainly that way when I was a kid. Also, Marlboro wouldn't be looking to buy a majority of juul if this thing wasn't gonna go somewhere.

aVYeah, some people, man. That\u2019s also why a lot of vape shops are taking 50mg bottles out of stores unless they\u2019re in pre made pods (juul pods) 
p1383
aVjuul was actually just required to make their pods 30mg, i hit one the other day and there wasn\u2019t much throat hit it was strange
p1384
aVWell I had absolutely no idea! The only squonker I've ever looked at was that pulse thing that looks like a 6yr old got a 3D printer for his birthday and thought he would try to out-vape his friend's juul. Thought this looked quite similar to that to be fair... 
p1385
aVIt made me wheeze like crazy because it was brand new and nobody around me had tried it yet, so I dove in head first. I could smoke a pack of cigarettes and not get a buzz. I guess it's a consequence of my "fuck my body I'll chain smoke until I'm done" mindset giving me this inhuman tolerance to nicotine. However, that 50mg had me spinning on a .6 breeze coil and I knew it couldn't be good for me if I wanted to be able to vape anything less than that for the rest of my life. Switched to a juul and the cloud production is night and day, now back on the higher ohm breeze coils and 25mg doing swimmingly.
p1386
aVlong time smoker... i started at 49mg with a juul, got sick.  Got a breeze, dropped to 24mg, still got sick.  Went to 12mg...and yuck.   switched to regular nic down to 6mg.. and that was the magic number for me.   Ive been smoke free for over two months.  Dropped my juice to 3mg...and I was craving smokes.  I need to stay at 6mg for a while.    I never realized how bad nicotine can make you sick.  It's crazy.  
p1387
aVQuit coverages, want to try Vaping it Juuls\u000a\u000aI\u2019m wanting to quit smoking for a number of reasons. Mostly because of how stinky I get while I am smoking cigarettes all day. Nobody likes the smell and most of the time I forget about it until I smell my clothes the next day. I\u2019ve tried Vape Pens and most of them make me choke really bad. People say it hit hard and you won\u2019t cough and there is no way around it for me. I feel like the coils fuck my chest up even more than cigarettes. Has anyone had any luck with Juuls either? And what recommendations do y\u2019all have for a new time member of a Vape pen?
p1388
aVI would suggest a pod system like the aspire breeze 2 over Juuls, with everything going on in the news and their flavor quality going down I would look at other alternatives. The main reason it messed up my chest when I switched was because I went from have a dry inhale to a moist inhale. It does take time to get used to but finding a good pg/vg mixture with a good system will drastically reduce the chest pain you're having.
p1389
aVMy first mod is coming in tomorrow, wish me luck in quitting the juul!\u000a\u000aAfter smoking for 6 years and switching to the juul I\u2019ve been able to successfully quit smoking cigarettes. But I\u2019ve quickly learned after about 7 months that the juul is just far too expensive and in my opinion way more addictive than cigarettes. I\u2019ve recently made the decision to try and step away from the juul and hopefully nicotine in general. So I went and ordered my first mod and am beyond excited to make the switch, got a few bottles of 6mg juice with a goal in mind to one day require 0mg. I\u2019ve received so much help in this community enlightening me on vaping, mods, coils, ect. And I just want to say thank you to everyone on here and happy vaping. (:
p1390
aVHopefully you\u2019ll notice a fantastic difference. Juuls will taste like straight chemicals after a week or two. Good luck! (I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it, though) 
p1391
aVYeah I\u2019ve been on vws and vwn all day switching between the two. Having the best experience with my new vape! Only hit my juul 2 times since getting it just to compare and I think this will be easier than I thought. 
p1392
aVJuul is way to expensive quit the juul 2weeks ago myself,there supposed to be coming out with a new juul device I'll probably give it a shot just to see how it is,because i hated the inconsistency of the hits on the juul.
p1393
aVThe ovns/juul pods are a gift for a friend of mine. Pod juices: Mango Twist by Pod Juice, Blue raz candy iced by EJV, and apple iced by 7DAZE. looking forward to all of them \U0001f60b
p1394
aVIm a newbie and have only tried ones like juul, sourin drop and vagon, and the SMOK badge. Do you use salt nics or eJuice? I\u2019ve only tried the salts, but like the variety of flavors available in eJuice. I\u2019m really trying to quit smoking cigs and have read people saying that the box mods are the best way to do that. I am leary of the complexity of coils and cotton and the lingo left me confused. I have been doing research and this sub reddit on vaping had been helping me!! I\u2019m actually becoming addicted to this page! Thanks 
p1395
aVSmall and not much nicotine?\u000a\u000aI am looking for a vape that is not big and does not contain a lot of nicotine. I would have a Juul but the nicotine is too much for what I like, but the size is what attracted me to almost buying one. Any help?
p1396
aVJuul Pods and bad business practices\u000a\u000aI work in a vape shop. We have a large supply of what will be the last flavored shipment from Juul. We have, and continue to sell them for $19.99\u000a\u000aI have had a slew of new customers coming in, saying that places around town are charging upwards of $40 a pack! \u000a\u000aIs this happening anywhere else? I understand supply and demand with the recent federal flavor ban. But that just seems like shitty practice to me.
p1397
aVIt's happening because Juul stopped selling all flavored pods to distribution companies and retail stores, they'll only sell them cool mint, menthol, and tobacco flavors.  When Juul announced this the distribution companies skyrocketed their flavored pod prices within about an hour or two.  These shops that were paying somewhere around $10 wholesale for a pack of pods are now paying around $30 wholesale with Mango being the most expensive.  Unfortunately this is probably only the beginning of the price increases, I'm sure they'll keep going up as distribution companies run out as well.  With that being said you can still go to Juul's website and order whatever pods you want straight to your door for the normal price, it's just going to be harder to find them in brick and mortar stores as time goes on.
p1398
aVI guess I read your post too quickly earlier before I commented.  If your company is charging these other stores the regular old prices and didn't upcharge them after Juul sent their last shipment then yeah I'd say they're using shitty practices jacking the price up in the store.  Where I'm at all the bigger or semi-local distros jacked their prices up so we pulled them off our shelves and replaced them while other local stores think they'll still sell at $35-$40 a pack

p1402
aVbuy her a juul. easiest and closest to cigs
p1403
aVJuuls actually already at 59mg/ml, so it definatly higher than a 50mg limit
p1404
aVJuul Compatible, refillable, more durable than Juul pods! I'm using bubblegum :D\u000a\u000a
p1405
aVQuestion about the novo. I\u2019m looking for a Juul replacement but want a pod system that clouds the same as the Juul. In other words doesn\u2019t produce clouds like a full mod does. Does the novo compare?? 
p1406
aVI just got the novo to get off the juul. I was using the juul for around 2 years and the novo has been a very good replacement. Only use my juul when I go out drinking now and the novo daily
p1407
aVI was a juul pod and a half a day guy. Novo pods last me 3 days with 3-4 refills

aVCan i use salt nic in a regular mod?\u000a\u000ai was at the vapestore today planning on getting some salt nic juice and the guy told me i need a pod system or those small vapes,i wanted to try it because i know juul and whatnot uses salt nic and i really enjoyed the throught hit but not the consistency of the hits,so i was hoping to get it for the new mod i got,so could i use salt nic?
p1410
aVMouth to lung, like a cig or juul. DL means direct lung, like an RDA.
p1411
aVI was vaping a juul pod in a day and that's supposed to be a full pack worth of nic. Half a cigarette knocks me on my ass.
p1412
aVI never smoked but I picked up vaping because the idea of inhaling vapor that tastes like candy really intrigued me lmao. I started with no nicotine but after doing hours of research and thinking I decided to buy a bottle of 3mg nicotine juice to try it out and it gave me a really nice headbuzz that I really enjoyed. Eventually your tolerance goes up, so the only way around that is to buy higher nicotine level juices. I would not say I was addicted to the nicotine, I just enjoyed getting a headbuzz first thing in the morning. I tried every level of nicotine until I decided to buy a juul. The nicotine levels in a juul are around 50mg and before that I was on 24 mg and the headbuzz it gave me was way more intense. Eventually my tolerance rose to where 50mg did nothing for me and I decided to quit using high nicotine juice and exclusively vape 0-3mg nicotine juices. Personally I did not find it difficult whatsoever to quit vaping nicotine, it\u2019s been about a year and I\u2019ve only vaped high nicotine levels occasionally with some friends. I vape for the flavors of the juice and the satisfaction of blowing huge clouds, not for the nicotine. I haven\u2019t experienced any form of addiction after using it for a year and no negative side effects as well but vaping nicotine is relatively new so no one really knows the ultimate long term effects. 
p1413
aVSmoked cigs for 7years and i switched to juuls about 3years later i lost a job and could not afford pods anymore so i went back to cigs for a month(till i found another job then switched to a mod)anyways when i went back to cigs i did notice a drop in pleasure.that doesn't mean it more addicting its subjective if one finds more pleasure in vaping than it will release more dopamine and you would be more "addicted" to vaping,but if one finds cigs more pleasurable then the cigs would be more addictive.its SUBJECTIVE so you would say i am more addicted to vaping,not vaping is more addictive,very lazzy post.
p1414
aVI do! I basically haven't touched any of my other vapes since getting the Alto. It has the smoothest, quietest, and most satisfying out of all the pod systems I've tried (Juul, Phix, Myle, plus various refillables). I use the mixed fruit pods which aren't the greatest tasting (Phix blue raspberry gets that accolade), but it's a fair trade off. Love my Alto. 
p1415
aVThis is so close to being a Juul killer for me.  Its better in every way except for the taste.  If they could improve the flavors, it would be the best gas station vape hands down.

aV(Update) Juul Engraving Website Launched\u000a\u000a Hi Fellow Redditers\u000a\u000aAbout Two weeks ago I posted that I was preparing to launch a Juul Engraving Startup\u000a\u000aThere were lots of positive reactions from you guys so I'm posting again to update that finally we are Live!\u000a\u000aTo fill the gap on how the piece works:\u000a\u000aWe want to approach the customizing market in a radically different way by providing Pre-Engraved/Custom Engraved Juul shells. Yes, the Shell not the Whole Device :)\u000a\u000aThat way there is no hassle of sending the whole device back and forth between every engraving.  \u000aWe all occasionally might have seen Juul Wraps and Cases but I believe the best solution for customizing a Juul is through laser engraving. Durable, non-fading and finally no more of that sticky residue! Engravings are permanent and will never fade away. You can even feel the texture!\u000a\u000a![video](90kfi4ymb0121 "One of the designs on the \u005c"trippy\u005c" end")\u000a\u000aI got lots of designing ideas and help fellow redditers as well as friendsand I would like to thank you all for the warm welcome and support.\u000a\u000aTo pay back the support, I decided to lower the price of all products for the next one month.\u000a\u000aWe picked only the premium materials for the products and paid lots of attention to not the product but packaging as well as website.\u000a\u000aEnjoy :) - [www.engraze.com](http://www.engraze.com/)\u000a\u000a**DISCLAIMER:** Our products and designs are not Affiliated, Related nor licensed by JUUL.

aV10mg for nic salt is really low. Juul pods have 50mg pretty sure you're good 
p1418
aVIf you go online and look up information on nicotine, you'll see that it takes quite a lot to be toxic.  Juul's are 50 mG though they probably aren't used for direct-lung.  While you are looking into how nicotine affects the body, you'll see the problem will arise more from complications with existing conditions (like high blood pressure) over actual toxicity.  You have the ability to become well informed via the Internet.  :)\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aP.S.  Go by Wikipedia more than WebMD.  The latter is biased towards "preserving" your health.  Same thing as if you were looking into caffeine.

aVNot had a cigarette in a month!\u000a\u000aI\u2019m 23 from the U.K. and have smoked since I was 16.\u000a\u000aA few years ago I tried to get into vaping and bought an Innokin Coolfire 4. It was too overwhelming, too many things to keep on top of.\u000a\u000aI didn\u2019t really understand why juice was leaking, why I had no flavour after a while and so of course I went back to cigarettes because it was easier.\u000a\u000aLately I had a bit of a health scare (pulled a nerve and couldn\u2019t feel legs and feet) and it made me realise that next time it might not be a trapped nerve and something more serious.\u000a\u000aSo I decided to quit, I tried a JUUL but thought it was pretty weak but accompanied with nicotine losenges it did the job.\u000a\u000aI am currently using a myblu pod vape it\u2019s not the best but has more of a throat hit and is more convenient for me to pick pods up.\u000a\u000aI keep reading and learning and seeing everyone\u2019s post and I feel like I\u2019m going in the right direction to become more experienced in vaping.\u000a\u000aI bought an Innokin EQ and hopefully should be here tomorrow with a Nic Salts juice to go with it.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m already eyeing up then Lost Vape Orion, I cant help but want to try more and more devices.\u000a\u000aI see a lot of people not like the idea of pod systems but I honestly believe without them I wouldn\u2019t of give vaping another chance.\u000a\u000aFor an outsider there is a lot to get your head around.\u000a\u000aI already know more about things I didn\u2019t know about last time because of the addiction to wanting to keep upgrading! \u000a\u000aI know soon enough I\u2019ll go for something more advanced but pod systems give me a chance to break in easily\u000a\u000aAnyway I dunno why I\u2019m rambling just proud of not smoking for so long as I smoked 20 a day for so long.\u000a\u000aAnyway the posts on here are very informative and everyone seems friendly so thanks for the nightly reads!\u000a\u000a\u000a

aVShould I buy a smok novo?\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve been thinking of replacing my juul with a new pod system, and this one is nice and small, plus easily refillable AND in my budget. Is it worth it? 
p1421
aVok, i also feel like it\u2019s the best option for me because my juul has been hitting thin and spitting and i just want a reliable vape. i\u2019m looking for more milky clouds 
p1422
aVIs there other juice that has the same nic feeling that strong nic salts do? I was using a mod a 3mg for a while then I tried a juul and realized it's all I needed. Small, compact, 2 hits (mtl) and I'm really feeling the buzz just like a cig. I get the numbers though..
p1423
aVNo. Nic salts are different than regular nicotine juice. However, you can dilute nic salt juices to put in a regular tank/atty, or you can get a pod system that allows you to refill the pod, unlike the Juul.\u000a\u000aMy Smok Rolo Badge for example fits at least twice the amount of juice than a Juul does, and I can keep refilling it until it starts to go bad in about 2-2.5 weeks. Nic salt juice goes a long way too.

aV[HELP] Replacement for throat hit of Smok Fit &amp; Juul?\u000a\u000aSemi noob here.. I switched from cigs to nic salts about 7 months ago.  Getting a cig like throat hit is my #1 priority.  Been rocking the Juul and then the Smok Fit.  Loved the Juul but it was too expensive.  Smok devices obviously have tons of quality issues but I actually REALLY loved the way the Fit hit.  Nice, full throat hit that didn't make me miss cigarettes or the Juul.  But over the past week or so it seems like the Fit is dying on me and giving weak hits so i decided to head to the vape shop and grab something else.  First spot i went strongly recommended the VooPoo VFL and said it hit very much like the Fit but with a stronger throat hit.  But after using it i was really disappointed.  Very little throat hit compared to Fit and Juul, it was like flavored air.  Brought it back then went to another spot which recommended the Vaporesso Zero, again saying that it had the throat hit i was looking for.  I like it better than the VFL but still not getting anywhere near the throat hit i got off the Fit.  And I'm using the same exact bottle of 50mg nic salts that was ripping like a champ out of the Fit.  It seems like all the shops around me dont mess with salts and dont really understand what im looking for.  Taste and buzz is nice but with out a full throat hit it doesn't cut it for me.  Any body have any good recommendations for me? I would really appreciate some advice because honestly I'm lost and i REALLY dont want to go back to cigs.
p1425
aVI picked up a novo recently. I was a steady juul guy and I bought other pod devices in the past (breeze 2, phix) which I hated. The novo has been very solid in my replacement for the juul since it\u2019s so similar. I\u2019d recommend

aVNeed advice to help dad with switching to vaping.\u000a\u000aSo my old man decided to switch from smoking to vaping a week ago. I got him stlth (its basically juul) with 30mg/ml nic salt cartriges. He didnt want 50mg cartridges. He seems to like it, but is still being an angry bear due to not smoking. He is too lazy to deal with coils and cotton etc with more complex devices. I was wondering if i should get him aspire breeze 2 to feel more satisfied with vaping. You guys think that a good idea? Also, should i get him higher strength nic salt? I used to smoke soooo long ago and only vape now and have no idea what would be helpful with switching.

aVJuul Nicotine Content Claims Don't Add Up\u000a\u000aI've heard it repeated again and again that a Juul pod contains about the same nicotine as a pack of cigarettes. I decided to do a little research. Juul's website says:\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a&gt;Each 5% JUULpod is designed to contain approximately 0.7mL with 5% nicotine by weight (approx. 40 mg per pod based upon 59 mg/mL) at time of manufacture.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aSo a pod contains about 40mg of nicotine.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aResearch shows that a typical, full strength domestic cigarette contains about 12mg of nicotine. A light cigarette has about half that, at 6mg. [Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3905555/).\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aA pack of cigarettes has 20 cigarettes. 20 \u005c* 12 = 240mg. A Juul pod does not even come remotely close to this number. A Juul pod contains about as much nicotine as 3 full strength cigarettes, or 6 light cigarettes.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aEven when accounting for [the efficiency of delivery from vaping vs smoking](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4469966/), the bio-available nicotine content of a Juul pod does not come close to the content of a pack of cigarettes.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aWhere exactly is this claim coming from? Why is it so prevalent and unquestioned? The back of the official pod packaging even says "Each Juul pod contains \u005c[...\u005c] approximately equivalent to 1 package of cigarettes". That is a patently false, misleading claim.

aVSome questions about coils and vaping in general?\u000a\u000aSo I\u2019m new to vaping and having just quit cigarettes by using the juul I\u2019ve decided I want an actual mod because I\u2019m tired of paying 20$ for my pods to leak and need to cut back on the juul anyway. So I plan on buying the smok v2 species and I read about temperature control and seen that the coils it comes with and replacements cant use tc mode and so really I\u2019m wondering what other coils could I use in my vape for tc and if it\u2019s even worth it? Like I said I\u2019m super new to this and there is a lot to learn. I\u2019m so clueless whenever I read about ohms and wattage and have no clue what kind of settings to use when I get the thing. I\u2019m just hoping this community could help me out lol. \u000a\u000aLeave any tips or any general information no matter how basic and I\u2019d be greatly appreciative. Thanks!
p1433
aVI\u2019m gonna save you a lot of trouble and tell you to stay away from smok. \u000a\u000aAs far as temp control goes. You won\u2019t really use that feature much if at all with tanks. It\u2019s primarily for people that build coils in an rda/rta/rdta. And even then a lot of people just stick with wattage mode. Almost all mods now have TC but you don\u2019t need to worry about that feature. \u000a\u000aI totally understand the juul thing and why you wanna switch to something else. But if you don\u2019t mind me asking is there a reason you\u2019re looking at box mods?  A pod system with some high nic salt juice might suit what you are looking for a little better. 
p1434
aVIt\u2019s just something I\u2019ve always been interested in. I\u2019m still going to use my juul and am just hoping that with a big ole nice cloud blower that I\u2019d tend to save a little more money and smoke that. I\u2019ve always liked smoking and I\u2019ve always wanted a mod type vape before. You\u2019re probably right though about staying with a pod type system, but it\u2019s something I wanna try. I\u2019m really hoping it will be enough for me, I\u2019d rather not waste my money but at the same time it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been interested in for awhile. It feels like a hard decision because I\u2019m a very indecisive person but that\u2019s a whole different topic lol\u000a\u000aI\u2019m not doubting what you said about smok at all, I was just told by someone and read things online saying they were great. May I ask what the trouble is with them and could you maybe point me in a different direction? Like I said before this is all new to me and I really appreciate your feedback to enlighten me. \u000a\u000aThank you. 
p1435
aVSmok....  oh boy where to start. I\u2019ll start with the light and go to the hard. \u000a\u000aTanks leak like a sieve, coils are trash and 1/4 in a pack at least will be a dud and the others won\u2019t last more than a week because smok doesn\u2019t believe in quality control. The chips and internals in them are subpar. They are overpriced as all hell. \u000a\u000aNow the serious side of things. They are notorious for having meltdowns. Not all of them do but I\u2019ll tell you almost all the meltdowns I have seen are smok. And the part that makes me hate them the most is that unlike other companies that do something about it smok just says \u201csorry I almost burned down your house here\u2019s a 50% off coupon for another\u201d. They are an irresponsible company.  They release a new product every 2 weeks to the point that they can\u2019t keep up with themselves and their quality control severely suffers. To a dangerous degree.\u000a\u000aNow if you wanna go the box mod route do know that the nicotine levels you\u2019re gonna get are gonna pale in comparison to the juul. You can\u2019t use salt nic in them and it\u2019s gonna be a different kind of vape. There\u2019s nothing negative about that just something to note so you know what to expect. \u000a\u000aI recommend either an Aegis Legend or Nova (both by Geekvape) and a Freemax Mesh pro tank. \u000a\u000aAlso the VooPoo drag 2 and mini are excellent options. Both come as a kit and have pretty decent tanks with them. \u000a\u000aIf you like the flashier bigger screens Vaporesso (have had bad luck personally with them but they are well loved in the industry) has the luxe and polar kits that will be decent and closer to the style of the species. \u000a\u000aAdditionally you\u2019re gonna want to ask yourself if you want internal or external batteries. The pros of external are that you can carry spares (in a case for safety of course) and once the battery diminishes in capacity over time you don\u2019t have to replace the batteries. The pros of internal are that it\u2019s simply less things to worry about. You might need to charge it more throughout the day but you can do so through the mod so it\u2019s easier and cheaper than an external charger.\u000a\u000aIf you want to go the internal battery route I\u2019d get a Voopoo Drag Mini. The kit tank is, like I said, pretty great for a kit tank. And the battery life on it is impressive. It\u2019s the only internal mod I have in my regular rotation.\u000a\u000aFor external I would personally go with an Aegis Legend and Freemax Mesh pro. The legend is drop, dust and waterproof and it isn\u2019t a gimmick. I have two of them and the 100w half size version and they are damn near bulletproof.\u000a\u000aThat being said any of the above mentioned mods will be good bets for you if that isn\u2019t your style. \u000a\u000aBut as attractive as some of the mods may be please stay away from smok. It\u2019s gonna give you a lot more of a headache than you want. \u000a\u000aGood luck and congrats on quitting btw!!!  Feel free to post on here or pm me if you have any other questions!!!  \U0001f44d\U0001f44d

aVHaha I have my juul with another damn pod that\u2019s started leaking as soon as I popped it in. \U0001f644 I was aware of the whole nic salt difference and I\u2019m just hoping that regular juice will help me lower my nicotine cravings slightly because I\u2019m just such a stress/bordom smoker and don\u2019t really have the money to go through these things as much as I do. I\u2019m looking at the vaporesso luxe right now and must say I realllly like it. It\u2019s a shame the iris design is sold out. 
p1437
aVHold on I\u2019m gonna pm you. I don\u2019t want everyone going all up in arms about what I have to say about juul. \U0001f923
p1438
aVDo the pods last a decent amount of time? I use the Juul and replace the pod every 4 days about and I\u2019d like to switch to a budget friendly refillable pod system for juice variety n to save a little on pods 
p1439
aVAll of these will last longer than a juul, and end up being cheaper. The Mi-Pod probably has the longest lasting coils out of anything here. 
p1440
aVI switched from Juul to Sourin Air and I've been saving a ton. Being able to pick your own juice and nic strength is great and the pods last about 2-4 refills for me and I can usually get just over a week of life on them.
p1441
aVThank u so much! I have a smok prince but I recently switched to juul...switching to juno tho this weekend but they arent refillable. \u000a\u000aI may switch back to my smok if I can get cbd juice. Koi is a good brand? Good quality cbd? Ive had some cbd before that didnt even give me any effects but ive also had really good cbd candy too.
p1442
aVNo problem! I get that! Never personally used a juul cause I\u2019ve been told the spitback on those is crazy bad! Koi is a really good brand for CBD in my opinion! I haven\u2019t tried their actual vape juices but I know their cbd worked really well for me! Plus some brands you may have to go higher on the MG to get the full effect! I usually get vape tongue super easily but never did with the cbd! They released this new flavoring for it called strawberry blast or something like that and it\u2019s like crack! (Or at least what I imagine crack would be like lmao). It\u2019s all just dependent on personal preferences and your own immunities/how often you use stuff like that. Same thing with nicotine levels in vaping; each person is different. I used 12MG in vaping for a bit and then I went down to 6 but if my boyfriend hits a 6 he dies lol
p1443
aVDo you know how many 14 and younger kids have Juuls? At least he\u2019s not smoking cigs like most of my friends did at that age. Hell if vapes were around when I was that age I\u2019d have been doing that and maybe would have been less stressed in school. 
p1444
aVAnyone else try the VooPoo VFL?\u000a\u000aFirst off I'm no expert on devices.  I'm all about the throat hit.  I came off cigs with the Juul about 8 months ago and eventually switched to the Smok Fit (i know, Smok sucks but it was an affordable placeholder).  The Fit didnt last very long but while it worked I actually really enjoyed the way it hit.  I was over at my local store today and was told that the VooPoo VFL was definitely the way to go if I liked the throat hit of Juul and Smok Fit and that the throat would definitely be better than the Fit.  I dont know if they were just trying to make a sale but I'm EXTREMELY disappointed with the throat hit.  Even on the highest setting it just feels like I'm breathing flavored air.  The store owner swore this hit harder than the Fit so I'm pretty confused.  Has anyone else tried the VFL yet?  Anyone have any suggestions of anything I might be doing wrong?  The buzz is ok but this isnt remotely cutting it as far as throat hit.  I'm also using the same salt that I used in my Smok Fit and for me even the Fit had better throat hit, flavor and buzz.  If you're looking to replace your juul definitely look elsewhere :/
p1445
aVThe Juul Is Dead To Me.\u000a\u000aI switched to the juul from cigs last june. It was a love hate relationship that ended in fiery hate. After 2 devices, hundreds of dollars blown on packs of leaky pods, pod burning problems, device charging/ other battery life problems, and a juul that went into party mode every time i hit it, I finally got rid of mine. After doing so I realized the juul is not very cost efficient either; in new york a pack of pods is 20 dollars, and they'd last me a week- a week and a half depending on how many of the pods completely leaked out (my last pack of cucumber pods 4/4 leaked).\u000a\u000aWith that being said, i'm in the market for a new pod device. Initially my plan was to switch to the Myle, a few of my friends have it and I like the pod flavors and the way it hits, but much to my chagrin Myle issued a statement in the beginning of this month saying they wont be selling their products in the US anymore. Just my luck. In the meantime, my boyfriend has lent me his Suorin air which im vaping rn using a 45 salt nic juice and I don't like the way it hits at all. It might just be due to the flavor (blue raspberry lemonade), but for some reason I find the throat hit feels very burnt, harsh, and not as smooth or satisfying as the juul. I'm using a fresh pod so I know it's not actually burnt, but it just doesn't feel the same. Has anyone else switching from the juul experienced this with the suorin? Should I keep the suorin and experiment with different juice flavors? Or would I be better off trying an entirely new device?\u000a\u000aThe smok novo has caught my eye but i've read mixed reviews about Smok devices on this sub. I'm looking for something thats the closest I can get to a juul in terms of size, simplicity, and throat hit satisfaction. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated, thanks!!!
p1446
aVHey bud. Try the Kilo 1K POF system. I have the JUUL and this device and the KILO is hands down better. There is not an issue with having to reseat the pod, like in the JUUL, to get a good drag. The battery life literally lasts me all day. Sometimes more than a day. Check it out on YouTube. \u000a\u000aHope this helps. 
p1447
aVI have a lost vape Orion on order, but didn't want to battle the Juul pods any longer so I stopped into a shop in the bigger town while taking my daughter in for an orthodontist appt.\u000a\u000aI picked up the boulder rock and a pack of pods. Pretty impressed with it for the price.
p1448

aVThe i couldn't wait for my Orion to arrive so got something to get me by because i am sick of Juuls.\u000a\u000a
p1450
aVThis isn't a bad little device, better than the Juul. The pods hold a good amount of liquid and decent flavor.
p1451
aVBoulder Rock http://www.bouldercigs.com/index.php/Ecigs/rock\u000a\u000aI stopped in the vape shop and told them I am sick of using Juuls and had a Lost Vape Orion on the way but wanted something to get me through the week, and to have as a backup. They recommend this. I think it is actually cheaper than a Juul, but so much more satisfying hits.
p1452
aVCan i fill my Juul?\u000a\u000aCan i fill up my juul with a 0% nicotine e-liquid? And can u buy a pod with 0 nicotine?
p1453
aVIf you did little juul fairies would come and muck you up 
p1454
aVJuul does not make pods without nicotine, but there are other pod systems made to be refilled. If you want to refill the pods you currently have, there may still be videos on YouTube that can instruct you on how to do it.
p1455
aV\U0001f602\U0001f602 I bet nobody would buy a juul again

aVSub ohm 50mg nic salts\u000a\u000aSo I found it hard to find information about this online.   I bought a vaporesso revenger  200w mod as my first real mod I paid for myself.  I got a smok tfv8 cuz it was on sale for 20 bucks(I\u2019ve heard the bad stories about it and so far I prefer the stock vaporesso over the tfv8 because the v8 seems to leak a bit.  Not much but it\u2019s gotta be cleaned.\u000a\u000aI also bought some 50mg blues lemonade  salt nic cuz I wanted to try refilling all those loose juul pods I have lying around so I could use the juul at like work and as a backup and just as an experiment.   Well the experiment worked well in the juul and I liked the flavor so much I wanted to put it in my tank.\u000a\u000aBut everyone I spoke to said \u201comg no you can\u2019t do that: you\u2019ll break it, gunk it up,  or overdose on nicotine,\u201d or something.   Eventually curiosity got the better of me and I got a fresh coil rated for 30-80w(lowest I had) and put it in.  Let it soak for ten minutes and hit it.   \u000a\u000aAnd yeah, it\u2019s strong; but I kind of like that. I keep it at 30w and take 1-1.5s rips off it and it\u2019s smooth as hell.  Everyone said it\u2019d be too harsh but it\u2019s smoother then some 12mg freebase I\u2019ve tried.  \u000a\u000aPluses: 1 hit quit.   One lung full is all you need to buzz.   One can easily get nic\u2019d out on one hit.  Take a lung or two and you\u2019ll have to lie down and let the room stop spinning.    But to me, someone who can control themselves, this is awesome let me explain why:\u000a1: coil lasts longer: I take wayyy less hits at lower wattage.  I\u2019d need to take 9 hits to match one hit of this with 6mg. That\u2019s gonna wear out a coil9 times as fast.\u000a2.  Juice lasts longer:   I go through 1/9th of the juice as with 6mg.   One bottle one 20$ salts lasts me like 3 months of all day everyday use.\u000a3.  Battery lasts longer:  less hits means longer battery life\u000a4. Saves time:  since I can get my buzz so quick, I go back to what I was doing in a second.  No 10-15 minutes analog break or 5 minute chain vape needed.  Just one or two hits and I\u2019m done\u000a5.gettin nic\u2019d out: it feels good if u don\u2019t go too far and it helps you poop like nothin else\u000aCons\u000a1. Tasty and smooth makes you wanna wake more but ya can\u2019t cuz it\u2019s so strong\u000a2. Could get really addicted to nicotine.   Like anything else, one develops a tolerance and physical addiction.  \u000a3.  Can\u2019t share your vape cuz it\u2019ll destroy the average person(could be seen as a plus lol)\u000aI\u2019ve been using the same coil for a week and it\u2019s working fine still.   I still have like 3/4 of the bottle I got 2 weeks ago and I also use that bottle for the juul pods.  So I\u2019ve officially started to save money now by now smoking:)\u000a\u000a\u000aAnyways: I just wanted to share my experience , hear others experience and wanted to know if there\u2019s anything I may have overlooked as far as a reason to not be vaping 50mg nic salts in a sub ohm tank.    I haven\u2019t thrown up or anything , one time I had to lie down for a minute but that\u2019s been the worst of it and it happened when I tried to do fully open high watt direct to lung and full up my lungs just to see what would happen(I got dizzy mystery solved).  But it wasn\u2019t so bad\u000a\u000a
p1458
aVThis is the type of shit that makes lawmakers want to ban vapes, people who treat nicotine like its crack and keep fucking with higher and higher nicotine to get a \u201chead rush\u201d like some 16 year old Juul challenge kid 
p1459
aVI still use the juul with the pods refilled with the same blue lemonade as the sub ohm tank when I\u2019m out and about or at work.  I only use the mod at home or while driving really.  I\u2019m scared to drop it :0. \u000a\u000aI like it so much:)
p1460
aVIdk: I just quit smoking cigs less then a month ago and I already bought the juul and the vaporesso revenger plus thatextra tank.   So I\u2019ve already spent a lot of money.    And while the juul isn\u2019t the greatest, I can buy pods anywhere and refill them up to five times each, which makes it pretty cheap.  And I can get pods online for even cheaper.  So overall I\u2019m pretty happy with the juul.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m open to suggestions though: what do you recommend?  I\u2019d want something with more vapor production that can use salts but that\u2019s similar in size.
p1461
aVCan attest to the lost vape orion, had the smok fit and wife had the juul, we both switched to the orion its light years ahead of other pods
p1462
aVPick up a Novo this morning instead of juul pods, very happy I did\u000a\u000a
p1463
aVJuul Alternative\u000a\u000aI\u2019m sure this gets asked a lot. But what y\u2019all recommending for a Juul killer? Something with nicotine salt, small hand size, and obviously refillable. Love the Juul but spending way too much on tiny pods. My shop recommended Renova Zero. Thanks for the advice \u000a
p1464
aVKwit Stick is my favorite and I have tried many. Fair warning, the tobacco flavor is trash and always prime the pod after refill, if you don't then it burns the wick and ruins the pod, I'm currently getting 6+ refills per pod. Other than that the hits are strong and consistent, no leaks, FAST charging and its cheap to use. They give you 10% off your first order and frequently send you emails for 10% coupon codes if you buy from their site rather than a wholesaler. They screwed up my order once but sent the missing item same day with no questions asked. Highly recommended over Juul, Ziip, Phix, Fit, Inifinix, Drop, and myBlu.
p1465
aVLooking for a new pod system\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve used a few pod systems but I can\u2019t find one that I really like. So far I\u2019ve used the Juul (hated it) battery life is short and pods are expensive. Tried both the Sourin air and Sourin Drop and they were okay but not amazing. Then moved to the SMOK Room Badge and it was good until the magnets that hold the pod in stopped being as strong. Currently using the Aspire Nautilus AIO and the coils don\u2019t last more than a few days because I use Nic Salts. If I want to continue using Nic Salts does anyone have a suggestion of what I should try next? 
p1466
aVGot it today ! Yay !\u000aSo, a little backstory. I\u2019m sick with the cold, flu, or sinusitis, or something of the sort and it\u2019s been kicking my butt this past week, specifically this past weekend. Spent the weekend being semi productive on Saturday which led to my downfall Sunday and resulted in me being a blanket burrito all of Sunday. Every time I touched the Juul would result in me coughing until my lungs hurt. \u000aWoke up today and felt great. Inhaled the Juul and coughed like crazy. \u000aGot the kilo 1-k, charged it (love they is micro usb) and stuck a pod in there (they looked huge compared to Juul Pods). I got the lemon berry ice and decided to go for it. Taste was light and sweet. Didn\u2019t hack up half my lung! \u000a\u000aI\u2019ll write a better comparative once my lungs function normally again. \U0001f601
p1467
aVAny small vapes similar in size to a Juul?\u000a\u000aPods went up to 28 a pack at my store so it's gonna be cheaper to pay for juice and coils instead. The only problem is I really like how small the Juul is. Are there any vape recommendations for a vape that's super small? Sorry if this has been asked before thanks in advance my dudes
p1468
aVNot a whole lot of vapes that small. Like at all. A refillable pod system might be your best bet the renova zero is a super highly regarded pod system that would be close to a juul like vape and size.
p1469
aVOh ywah sorry! I mean a refillable tank not a pod system if that helps! Doesn't have to be as small as a Juul but something smaller than the normal bulky system 
p1470
aVSmok Novo is pretty great\u000a\u000aNewish to the sub and casual vaper, and I stopped using the large Mods and tanks a while ago. I just came to say that I have been vaping for a few years now and when it comes to discreet and easy to refill and afford the Smok Novo has been amazing. I've had it for about a month now and it's been a huge upgrade compared to my Breeze 2. The Novo packs a pretty good punch for such a small device and the refillable pod system is alot easier than most and less expensive than juul. I don't work at a vape shop and I'm not getting paid to promote this I just honest to God love it. Also I dropped it getting out of my car the other day and didn't realize it. It spent a whole Michigan winter night outside, and after a full charge, it works just like it did when I first bought it
p1471
aVThat\u2019s not a bad grab at all given the JUUL is around the same price , and I\u2019m sure this blows a JUUL outta the water.\u000a\u000aI haven\u2019t found a local shop where I\u2019m at that carries them tho
p1472
aVWhere I\u2019m located the juul is significantly cheaper than this, but regardless the Orion is indeed a superior device, I have one, juul is too limiting with flavors and nic strength
p1473
aVOh man the Juuls by me sell for around $50 or so but any advice on juice flavors or nix strength for the Orion? I currently vape one hit wonders juices with 3 or 6 nic in box mod. For my Juul I just buy those expensive ass pods
p1474
aVJesus! my gas station sells Juuls for 12.99
p1475
aVDamn, nice grab. I was gonna buy myself a mod too during Black Friday but my go to store I went to wasn\u2019t having any sale so I\u2019m just stuck with my friends JUUL that I borrowed lol
p1476
aVI'm in Canada and vape B+Ms are popping up everywhere, they're booming. 64.99 is what JUUL charges on their website too btw. Only way to get it cheaper is to order from China.
p1477
aVBest MTL Nicotine Salt Pod System? Flavor?\u000a\u000aTitle. I have a juul but want to start making juice for one that has purposefully refillable pods. But I really like the MTL feel of it, anything like that with better flavor and refillable pods?
p1478
aVBut thats the things i think when they say "ecig" i think tuere referring to vuse,juul,and blu.
p1479
aVI've been saying this since forever and nobody believes Me.\u000a\u000aThis is the most underrated device ever and cheap as balls.\u000a\u000aPeople are drooling over orions, juuls suorin and other crap while this cheap pod just keeps chugging and it's cheap too.
p1480
aVWhy are there toilets in the Juul room?
p1481
aVLoving it. I was vaping on a Juul before this so this is one hell of an upgrade 
p1482
aVNeed help finding the right vape for me\u000a\u000aI'm relatively new to vaping but the nicotine has been helping me with my depression. I've never had a device of my own, but I often use my friends' devices (juuls and suorins) and I'm looking to buy a device of my own. However, I'm not a big fan of either of these devices that I've used because they don't have the longevity that I'm looking for. Juuls constantly require new pods and the coils for suorins seem to burn out after a week of use. I'm looking for a device that won't burn out on me after a short period of time and something that I won't have to constantly keep buying pods or cartridges for to keep using. I don't know much about vape devices, but I'm wondering if anyone on this subreddit might know of a device that would be good for me. 
p1483
aVNovice user here with 1or2 questions\u000a\u000aSo ive used some mods in the past from a copper Esquire,a wesmec,and some smok,but i stopped for 5years and in the process ended up useing vuse and juul products.well im back to the mods because the inconsistency of the hits with juul,and vuse started pissing me off especially with the prices.so i ended up with the smok E-prive and i enjoy it but feel like it could have better mechanics.and first time on this sub and seeing that smok isn't close to best and the chips in them are well garbage.but also when i went back to the mods when i went in store everything seemed new,they've had some voopoos in the vapeshop i go to and from this sub it seems like there good quality and they looked fucking cool but since i used smok in the past i decided why not.so im wondering whats a good mood to get next are voopoos high quality,and for a head piece ive had a dripper once in the past i forgot what there called but you put the juice right on the cotton.and they also had one that cost like 300$called i think Colorado or something like that but i got the buddha and was happy.so im wondering what mod should i invest in next?and what are some good dripper companies?
p1484
aVI just ordered one last night. Will have to try that juice.\u000a\u000aI was using a Smok alien 220 for a long time got sick if it and switched to using juul. The pods were getting to be expensive but I like the simplicity.\u000a\u000aDecided on the Orion because of the looks and reviews here.

aVInterested in an Orion, seen mixed reviews, need some advice from users please!\u000a\u000aHey all! I\u2019m not much of a vaper. I only use pod systems for the nicotine and don\u2019t do big ol mods and tanks and what not. I\u2019ve had many JUULs, Suorins, Smok Novo (my least favorite), smok infinix, and Renova Zeros (my favorite, bought three they\u2019re so amazing).\u000a\u000aI just mention those to possibly get a comparison. I\u2019m thinking of buying a Lost Vape Orion tomorrow, and I know they\u2019re hyped up, and hopefully it could be my last purchase for a while. I usually vape 50-55mg salts, but is that too high to be safe in the Orion 0.5 coil? It\u2019s amazing looking. I will never use freebase juices in it, I don\u2019t vape for clouds or anything, just like them for a replacement for an old chewing habit. I usually buy pod systems and hope they\u2019re good but this one is over double the price of any other ones so I wanted to get a few opinions of people who have had it a while. My local shop usually has advice on devices but they just got them in and they don\u2019t know too much either yet. Thanks in advance guys! Sorry I\u2019ve seen a lot of posts here on the Orion but none were very specific and just hand checks or from new users, and now I think there\u2019s a lot of people who have had theirs for a while.
