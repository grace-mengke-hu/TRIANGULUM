aVWeed vape / dab pen? Not getting high anymore?\u000a\u000aAlso posted this on r/drugs but I feel like I\u2019d get responses that are more helpful here.\u000a\u000aEssentially I\u2019ve been smoking pretty heavy for just over a year (about an O a week) and I\u2019m not getting high anymore. \u000a\u000aI\u2019m going on a \u201cbreak\u201d (kind of) for about 14 days, As I\u2019ve come back to my childhood home for the holidays. I\u2019ve smoked once on the first day back (4 days ago), and will probably smoke one or two more times before it\u2019s over. Now I mainly smoke batch bowls and blunts, however with the holiday loot that\u2019s come around I really want to pick up a weed vape / dab pen for after the break.\u000a\u000aOnly issue is, I have literally 0 clue how they work or what I should be looking for. I want something similar to my Juul that\u2019s small(ish) and portable, that will get the job done with ~$110 budget. Any advice on the vape/pen or lowering my tolerance would be much appreciated.

aVStiiizy\u2019s are discreet and kind of resemble a juul, i\u2019m not too sure about the quality of the oil as i haven\u2019t had one myself (only taken like 1 hit off of one before, that one hit was decent and i felt a tiny bit of a head change),  but i\u2019ve heard it\u2019s good and i know a lot of people that have one. \u000a\u000aReally, any wax pen you get is gonna be portable, they\u2019re typically not bulky. The batteries resemble more of an e-cig type thing. I know some brands that have a \u201chigh\u201d reputation \u2014 brass knuckles, heavy hitters, 710 interstate, and the stiiizy pods. \u000a\u000aFor getting your tolerance down, only thing that\u2019s gonna help that is not smoking. Now, how many days you might need, is completely up to your body. Maybe you\u2019ll only need to stop smoking for a couple days and you\u2019ll be good again, maybe you\u2019ll need a couple weeks. I have the same problem, super high tolerance. I go through dabs like crazy, i just wish there was a way to lower your tolerance without having to actually stop smoking haha.

aVThey\u2019re weird about smoking altogether, some days they\u2019re fine with me smoking wherever I want, some days smoking in my own room causes WW3 lol. They think the dab rig is too \u201cintense\u201d so I\u2019ve been stuck with a little bubbler-type bong that\u2019s low maintenance with little odour. \u000a\u000aAs for the darts I used to smoke a pack a day on top of the batch bowls, but the Juul has helped me cut back considerably.\u000a\u000aHahaha \u201cchops\u201d are what we call going to buy weed here. \u000a\u000aThe wax thing seems interesting, I\u2019ll definitely keep it in mind when I go back and I\u2019ll honestly probably end up on the path your on as long as it applies to me, like you said. \u000a\u000aThanks for all the help boss!

aVI also wanna introduce you to my lil friend called [Suorin Air](https://www.suorinusa.com/collections/suorin-air?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9trembS63wIVSh-tBh2kQgKKEAAYAiAAEgJqKvD_BwE) I use to have a phix (which was like a thicker &amp; taller juul) and so i know damn well how expensive it is to keep up that too. Buying pods is not cheap. I switched over to an Air, and i started saving a shit ton more money too. They\u2019re portable and discreet which i really like, but the only difference is \u2014 it\u2019s legit empty pods, and you buy the juice you want and just refill (one pod lasts up to 6 refills) and a decent size juice is about $20-$25 but it will last you AT LEAST a month. While the pods are around $3-$5 each. You have more flavor options \u2014 and you can control how much nicotine too (50-60 is about the same as a juul) I started saving AT LEAST an extra $50 a month just by switching. \u000a\u000ai\u2019m not tryna change your mind on anything, I just know how hard it is to try and keep up these habits while being broke as fuck hahaha :-) \u000a\u000a(if you\u2019re seriously interested, i could send you a link to a website that sells them cheaper than the actual suorin air website, it\u2019s where i order my juice and pods from)
