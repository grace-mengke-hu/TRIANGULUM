aVInnokin Endura T18 Review\u000a\u000aHowdy ECR~\u000a\u000aI'd like to share my experiences with the Innokin Endura T18. The device was sent to me by Innokin for the purpose of review around a month ago, and I've used it on a near-daily basis.\u000a\u000aThe device comes in neat packaging with a wonderful [quick start guide](http://i.imgur.com/21AX4Wx.png) by /u/jimmith inside the top. The package includes the T18 battery and tank, a micro USB cable, two coil heads, a nice desk stand, spare o-rings, and a manual.\u000a\u000aThe tank holds approximately 2.5mL of juice, which will easily last through the day. The top fill feature also makes it quick to refill. I found that the tank can get slightly floody if it's overfilled, so make sure that the liquid level stays a couple mm below the o-ring on the coil head. The tank needs to be refilled once the juice hits the bottom hole on the coil.\u000a\u000aI tested the tank on a VW device, and noticed that it works well up to around 20W. Anything much higher, and it doesn't quite keep up with wicking and gets slightly dry. It's very nice at the stock 14W if you like a relatively cool vape. I'm guessing that Innokin settled on 14W due to coil longevity and potential issues with dry hits at higher power levels. This testing was done with 50/50 juice, so it may not apply to thicker eliquids.\u000a\u000aI've tested 50/50, 60/40, 70/30 and 80/20 VG/PG ratios in the tank. The thinner juices worked well, but I ran into slight dry hits with 80/20 when chain vaping. I also found that the 80/20 juice was muted flavor-wise.\u000a\u000aI really like the drip tip that Innokin bundles with the Endura. The diameter is close to that of a regular cigarette, so it should be pretty familiar to people just switching from smoking. Aftermarket drip tips also tend to look good on the Endura, but the hole is somewhat shallow and some double o-ring tips don't sit flush.\u000a\u000aThe airflow on the Endura is not adjustable, it's a comfortable mouth to lung draw. It feels like a 1.5mm draw, and while it *can* be lung hit, it's not really meant for it. The draw is very similar to a cigarette, and also very similar to the Pax Juul. \u000a\u000aI have spent two weeks on the same coil in one T18 and it's still going strong. I'll update this review once it does need to be replaced, but as of now I'm very happy with their longevity.\u000a\u000aI would rank the vape quality out of the T18 tank to be close to the Apire Nautilus, maybe slightly better. \u000a\u000aThe T18 battery has a 1000mAh capacity, and doesn't quite last through a full day of regular vaping. I'd recommend that a new vaper either pick up two Endura T18 kits, or a T18 kit and a spare battery.\u000a\u000aThe fire switch isn't great. It's not easy to find quickly, and I've found that while the switch is nice and clicky at first, the original mod that I've been using for the longest has lost the audible click and is rather floppy. To be fair, that mod is from the first batch of Enduras, which Innokin has told me had defective switch housing.\u000a\u000aThe USB cover is a nice idea, but it's not particularly difficult to break off and how nicely it sits on the mod varies from mod to mod. The one I'm using right now sits very well on a table, but others are kind of precarious. The mod charges quickly, though one of the T18s that I've been testing gets quite hot around the button while it's plugged in.\u000a\u000aMy biggest issue is that all four of the kits that Innokin has sent me for testing suffer from the same intermittent firing issue. The Endura doesn't autofire, what happens is that randomly after firing it'll continue firing randomly for anywhere from half a second to around two seconds. It happened more often with the first batch Enduras that I orignally received, but still occurs with the later models. It hasn't caused any burnt coils or anything, but it's very irritating. I've spoken with other Endura owners about it, and nobody else has had this happen with anything but a first batch Endura.\u000a\u000aLength-wise, the Endura is comfortable in a front pocket. It's not super stealthy, but not as loud as many mods out there.\u000a\u000aI've asked my roommates (who all smoke) what they think of the Endura, and their opinions have been mostly positive. The main criticisms I've heard are about the length of the setup, but after hearing how long the battery lasts when compared to a cigalike, they're OK with it. They also all really like how it vapes. One of them sometimes uses an eGo ONE and much prefers how the Endura works due to how much more similar to a cigarette it is. \u000a\u000aOverall, I really like the Endura. I've been using it when I go out lately, and it really does the job. If Innokin can put a bump or something on the switch, fix the firing issue, and *maybe* bump the power output up another watt, I'd consider it perfect. I do however realize that my gripes are nitpicky and won't apply to everyone :\u005c^)\u000a\u000aIt's a great kit for someone looking to quit smoking, and I believe that it will be *very* popular among New Year's resolution-ers.\u000a\u000aThank you /u/Innokin_Joseph for sending me the T18 Endura for review!

aVWhy the Juul is a vaper's second best friend.\u000a\u000a[removed]
p3
aVSo... Why not just get a tiny ego with a protank mini and save a shitload of money? Since u r saying that Juul is shittier than even a basic setup
p4
aVSo I know you pointed out first thing you're not affiliated, but reading this reminds me of a line from Jimmy on this season of South Park:\u000a\u000a"... does [he] know [he's] an ad?"\u000a\u000aIt's well enough written but there are other options for stealth setups out there that cost less and provide more variety.  Juul is pretty overpriced IMHO especially when factoring in the cartridges.
p5
aVJuul has been coming here lately.
p6
aVI'd buy this if I ever needed a stealth vape, but I'd probably just buy a T18 or T22 for the customization between flavors and price difference.\u000a\u000aPAX will rise in its ranks using the JUUL platform though if OP says it works well. I disagree with the 50mg standard, but it is what it is.
p7
aVGo post this in /r/juul and keep it there. 
p8
aVHow stealthy do you need seriously? \u000a\u000aThis ain't small enough? http://www.visioncig.com/vision-ego-spinner-battery-variable-voltage-650mah-p-19.html\u000a\u000aPop a protank mini on it and call it a day. Save a crap load also, just because you can afford a Juul doesn't make it a smart purchase...
p9
aVI'm never buying anything that involves some type of proprietary system.  Although JUUL may work for you, I can get the same result from a protank mini/ego battery - at less than 1/3 the price.
p10
aVfunny you posted this because I'm seeing a bunch of the big players on instagram with Juuls lately.  like people that have all of the newest and coolest gear and juice, and all of a sudden they have a juul on their page.  pretty crazy....  it's too easy to assume that PAX just paid them to post it.  i actually believe it's good for what it does, and that's stealth vaping.
p11
aVI actually like the juul. I just don't like their recent attack on this sub and other forums.
p12
aVI haven't seen many other juul posts. Again, this is just my opinion and I'm not getting anything out of it. I'm just high as fuck and happy I don't have to stand outside in the rain to get my vape on when I'm three drinks in.
p13
aVDid you misread when I put in OP that this is my second job? You're kinda weird on your stalking while missing the entire context of your argument. My first job is at a law firm where I can't be chucking tits all over. So I use my juul and then take my mod during my lunch and maybe once or twice throughout the workday. It stays in my pocket at the vape shop.
p14
aVI'm not a juul rep though. I literally just bought there product and can vouch for it myself. Would you be saying that if I wrote an ancedote about the Archon I'm in CCI's pockets? Doubt it.
p15
aVExcept you can't provide an anecdote where it isn't harmless. Have you been next to a person vaping on a juul? If not I can't see how you can actually state this. 
p16
aVI didn't say it harmed others physically. I stated that it is rude and ill mannered. I have been near others vaping on cigalikes in indoor public spaces where it was not allowed. Not sure if juul or not because they were always stealth vaping. 
p17
aVThis makes me an apostate in here, but I've almost completely given up on my iStick/Nautilus in favor of just using juuls with disposable cartridges. It's smaller, looks a thousand times cooler, I like the flavors a lot, and is just easier to deal with. My only complaint is that I can't just refill a cartridge for it. I don't want to carry a lightsaber sized thing with me, I don't want to drip, I don't want gigantic hits. Am I alone? \u000a\u000aEdit: since this post isn't totally relevant to OP, I'll add: these are getting to be wildly popular in NYC, and I wouldn't be surprised if there is a major sea change towards small efficient setups on one end (that aren't trying to look like a cigarette) with your big box mod group on the other. Decent vaping with small devices is still a largely untapped market when you consider how shitty most of the big players are. 
p18
aVI can relate. I've come close to smoking again for the same reasons. I love vaping, but it can be a huge hassle. \u000a\u000aI carry a Juul with me everywhere now and mostly use my "real" vape gear when I'm at home. It's a helluva great nicotine delivery system. Convenient, dead easy, long lasting, and the nicotine is strong enough to kill a craving with 3 or 4 hits. I smoked 2 packs a day for more than 35 years, so that's no small feat. \u000a\u000aIt's also tiny, unobtrusive and great for stealth vaping. Looks like a little USB drive, I use it at my desk and no one notices. Might be worth a try. 
p19
aVI would recommend buying something like a JUUL instead. 
p20
aVUsed Juul cartridges -- anyone want to sell me some?\u000a\u000aI'm a big fan of Pax's Juul e-cig because it's discreet enough for me to take to school, but I hate their flavors. So I've started refilling the cartridges with my own juice. Does anyone here have used cartridges they want to sell me? I'd rather recycle than buy a bunch of expensive new ones only to dump the contents.
p21
aVPax Labs get's patent on it's nicotine salt e-liquid formulation found in its e-cigarette, JUUL
p22
aVJUUL has it's fans. I can't say I've never heard of it, but I also can't say I ever intend to try it. This is written like an ad though. It probably is one.
p23
aVIs there a real difference between salts and extracted nicotine when the JUUL uses 5% nicotine by weight?\u000a\u000aThat question might be mangled, but I'm really asking about the science between the two.
p24
aVI use the Juul for traveling and for going out to non-vape friendly bars - basically most places here in CA.  The nicotine punch is quite strong, especially for someone who has been off analogs and vaping 3mg for over 3 years.   The upside of this is that for smokers looking to quit combustion, the nicotine kick is more in line with what they are used to and may help with the success % - which is still quite low (below 25%) for smokers looking to switch over. 
p25
aVI use my JUUL a lot, especially when I'm out and about. I'm a huge fan of it. No hassle, good flavors for when I'm craving something potent. Cartridges are a bit expensive, but they last a long time for me. I would recommend it as a good first thing to try for those trying to quit cigarettes.
p26
aVThis is a good thing IMHO. I actually have a JUUL and it's the only cig-a-like I've tried that is effective. It's light, portable, doesn't create insane clouds, delivers your fix and can even be "lipped" similar to  traditional cigarette. Hell, the battery life even holds when chain vaping for the most part (better than any other). \u000a\u000aHopefully they get grandfathered under the new FDA regs (if they don't fix the regs in the mean time) so I still have a glimmer of hope for staying away from tobacco. 
p27
aVI burn through about 1/3 - 1/2 of a carto on mine daily. It helps the cravings a ton and it definitely hits you faster than a typical vape. \u000a\u000aI think I'm at 3-5mL of normal e-liquid now and before getting the JUUL I was at about 7-10mL. 
p28
aVThis may seem like an odd suggestion but [the juul](https://www.juulvapor.com/) works surprisingly well for people that want a low maintenance device. You can pick them up at gas stations for cheaper than online, too. They've got a decent amount of airflow for mouth to lung inhales and each pod lasts about as long as a pack of cigarettes would.
p29
aVDoes the JUUL by Pax include incurable lung cancer?\u000a\u000ahttp://www.abc15.com/news/national/e-cigarettes-linked-to-incurable-popcorn-lung-disease\u000a\u000aAnyone aware of this?
p30
aVLiterally has been posted over a dozen times in the last 48 hours... I think we are aware...\u000a\u000aAnd no idea on the Juul, ask the new /r/juul
p31
aVA subreddit for juul\u000a\u000aQuick note before I begin: I've noticed that users in the sub are suspicious that any post about juul is sponsored content or written by employees. I have absolutely no affiliation with the company. My friends and I are in a group chat and all got juuls and thought it was funny to keep talkin about juul as though it made us some cool club, and then today someone joked that r/juul should be a thing... So we decided to make the subreddit. Again I have never been in contact with anyone from juul and have no affiliation or incentive to post this. \u000a\u000aI recently got a juul and after a few weeks of lovin it I decided to check out the r/electronic_cigarette community to see what other people thought.\u000a\u000aI now realize that the juul is not what most people on this subreddit prefer. I get that it's a cigalike, has too much nicotine, is encumbered by a closed system, doesn't produce great smoke clouds, etc, which seems to be against what most vapers enjoy. \u000a\u000aHowever, I've also noticed that there are some users who do in fact like the juul, but every time it gets brought up lots of users in the sub are quick to shit on the juul and prevent a good conversation among people who actually enjoy juul. \u000a\u000aSo we've created the r/juul subreddit for fans of the juul. I understand it's not for most people on this sub so I thought it would be great to start a separate sub for those who enjoy the juul and want to learn more about it or discuss it with others who enjoy it. If you enjoy juul I hope you subscribe so we can get a decent user base. Who knows, maybe if it gets big enough we can start petitioning the company for more flavors or lower nicotine content options. \u000a\u000aThanks for allowing me to post this. I respect traditional and nontraditional vapers alike. Vape on!
p32
aVJuul lyfe! That's another one of the moderators/friend in the group chat. He's a cool guy send him a what's up!!
p33
aVI was vaping Fins before they started redesigning into semi-open systems.\u000a\u000aNothing against Juul, though I'd mess around with one if I found it in a store just to see the hype. I don't want to buy it online nor do I want to go to a head shop if they're sold there. Nothing against head shops either; I don't fit the culture, as much as I align with their sole purposes.
p34
aVA big draw of the juul and the sole reason for many (myself included) is the aesthetic of the juul. I think it's a truly unique product in that sense and as such deserves its own sub. 
p35
aVMy problem with Juul is the advertising. They are going straight at the teenage demographic, period.
p36
aVYou dedicate a sub reddit to just one product that isn't even innovative.  That's hella lame bruh. That product is lame and is in no way satisfactory.  The reason Noone talks about the juul here because it doesn't help get you off cigarettes. Did I mention it's pretty lame too. I guess I can't fault you on your enthusiasm on a product you love, but by saying so many times that you do not work for them, it kinda makes me think you work for them. So good luck on you and your friends circle jerk.
p37
aVI know 5+ people that couldn't get off cigs until the juul
p38
aVjuuls ruul, you druul
p39
aVGood for them man I never said they couldn't.  My only point is there are 100s of great products out there that can customize a user's experience. Then we have the juul, which is just another closed system cigalike. This thing is lame and you want to talk about it on r/electronic_cigarette. Nobody cares man. Down vote me all you want. I am just being real with you. 
p40
aVYou literally said "The reason no one talks about the juul here is because it doesn't help you get off cigarettes" and then proceeded to push your opinion to be a fact. 
p41
aVBy the way for someone who doesn't say they work for juul, your reddit accounts first post is only a week old. Did you just create a reddit username just to talk about juul? Kind of suspicious. 
p42
aVNo, we don't want to talk about it on r/electronic_cigarettes, we want to talk about it on r/juul and give people who want to talk about it a sub to talk about it and make it so that the subscribers to ecigs don't need to hear anymore about a product they clearly don't like. It's beneficial to you. This just makes it so that people who search juul on this sub will find this and good to the right place
p43
aVDude get out of here. There's nothing to talk about on your subreddit. Oh god which one of the 5 shifty flavors do you like? So interesting, right? I know you work for them anyways. Most the time when someone realizes that there are actually good vapor products out there they drop that bullshit juul in the trash where it belongs. But once again good luck to you. I just wanted to tell you about your shitpost and why nobody really cares about YOUR product. Sorry reddit didn't work in your favor.
p44
aVI'd like to join.  I've been an "advanced vaper" since 2012, and I LOVE my Juul.  Part of what I hate about vaping is some of the attitudes in the community.  I'll be sharing from a vapers prospective what I love so much about these little devices.  
p45
aVJuul 
p46
aVThis seems like a pretty big paid for commercial by innokin. No?\u000a\u000a\u000aPS. Juul for life\u000a
p47
aVIt definitely goes to this if his review is as accurate as they usually are or the JUUL for this years best stop smoking device 
p48
aVI've been using mine exclusively for about a month. I love it and I think it's a step in the right direction for form v function. My everyday carry has become the NEbox and the Juul. Mmm. The future.\u000a\u000aMy only gripe are the sketchy threads. Specifically, the battery door threads are atrocious and feel soft. The tank threads aren't perfect either, but they work most of the time.\u000a\u000aThe plastic tank is whatever. I would have preferred something replaceable and glass, but it works none-the-less.
p49
aVSo how's the JUUL? Looks pretty nest for a small device and I know the PAX are very high quality. 
p50
aVIf you're looking to quit, it may be worthwhile checking out some MTL setups. The Juul, iCare, and MyJet, for example, or go more old-school with a nautilus mini which fits on any 510 mod and uses less wattage. \u000a\u000aPart of the current trend in juices is much higher VG than used in MTL juices, as it produces more vapour. VG has an inherent sweet taste, and has a tendency to mute other flavours a little (which isn't a problem when you're blowing huge clouds). MTL juices give you a chance to cut back on the VG, and with the much better tobacco juices out there these days you may be able to have a closer approximation to what you're looking for. 
p51
aVThe 7qq pens can work,  but there are much better things for the price.  If they happen to have a juul at the 711 though,  that would work great. \u000a\u000aLook up eleaf icare,  joyetech ego aio,  and innokin endura.  Watch some youtube videos on them.  \u000a\u000aI honestly wish the devices i listed were around when I started.   Goid luck! 
p52
aVif you can find it, the pax juul is a good one. unfortunately, many of them are manufactured by large tobacco companies (markten, blu, vuse) and don't work for shit. my pet theory is that they're intentionally terrible so that people continue smoking lol\u000a\u000a
p53
aVTry the Juul by pax. I've gotten several friends off of analogs with the Juul
p54
aVinnokin endura t18 is more of a pen but it's very similar. joyetech aio is also pen style but much smaller. if you want a cigalike type experience try the eleaf icare. that one has an autodraw where you just inhale and it goes. for all of those you will need to purchase liquid and spare coils. if that's too much trouble and you don't mind spending the money, the pax juul is like a very good cigalike experience. really top notch. it's a pod based system so you will have to purchase liquid cartridges but a lot of convenience stores stock them and they have a store locator on the website. again, a bit pricier but less hassle. vapecrawler.com let's you find good prices and for the juul you will have to visit their site. 
p55
aVYes, the gas station vapes are notorious for being extremely low quality, and not being satisfying enough to quit smoking.  The only current vape that you can pick up in a gas station that I would recommend, and most other vapors, would be the JUUL.
p56
aVIt is going to be hard getting answers in this thread at this time, because of the overwhelming amount of people in here right now, but subscribe to the sub, we will get you straightened out for sure.  Until then, you could start reviewing the JUUL and the Innokin Endura T18.  The JUUL is getting pretty decent ratings by people trying to quit smoking, and the Endura is a tried and true vape, that imitates the draw of a cigarette fairly well.\u000a\u000aThose are the two I would start with looking into, and reviewing, and they are both affordable.  As far as the juice goes, between 12mg nic to 18mg nic for the average smoker is sufficient in starting out if she is to go with a device that allows you to choose your own juice.\u000a\u000aIn closing, although the two devices I recommended do not have a removable battery, if you where to look into any device with a removable battery, be absolutely sure that you and your wife are aware of battery safety.
p57
aVI would also like to add to what catchthemagicdragon said.  The mod that he suggested, I also would recommend to an extent.  It is a subohm, and certain people will prefer a vape that is more akin to smoking a traditional cigarette.  I personally needed a subohm to quit because they are far more powerful, but I seem to be outnumbered with new vapers that preffered the non subohm.\u000a\u000aThe Innokin Endura T18 is a very affordable pen style vape that replicates the style of smoking a cigarette much more than a subohm does, it has the tighter draw like a cigarette, and is good for mouth to lung inhaling.  Also I know that a lot of people are giving the JUUL very good reviews, and actually can be had in a gas station, although not to much is known yet about its new nicotine delivery (It uses nicotine salts).\u000a\u000aAgain those are just other options.  If you do go the other route, or get any vape that has an external battery, please do yourself and the entire vaping community a favor, and look into battery safety to ensure you keep yourself safe.  The batteries are safe when used and handled properly, but you do not want to ever throw them in your pocket, short them out, etc.. 
p58
aVBest advice I can give to someone switching, especially heavy smokers, is pick up a Juul. It's so damn close in draw to a cigarette, and has a similar throat hit and form factor. 
p59

aVMy parents, who know NOTHING about vaping, found my Juul and freaked out, and took it away.\u000a\u000a[deleted]
p63
aVAsk for it back , as long as you're of legal smoking age , and paid for it with your own money they can't really say anything. And if you do get it back , hide it better. Especially if its a juul.
p64
aVOh wow... I didn't expect that.   My post about you being on reddit was kind of a far cry I felt.   But so many vendors are on reddit nowadays so I figured I'd ask. \u000a\u000aSo many are vouching for you, I feel confident you'll make it right.   If I had a bunch more pods or something or pods for my Juul It wouldn't be such an inconvenience but I timed it so I'd get this bottle just in time to refill some my von erl pods and was just very disappointed when i opened the box.   \u000a\u000aDon't think this will be my last order from you either.   If a company messes up at all, and makes it right, I always come back.   Good customer service is something I REALLY want in a shop or vendor.   So I really appreciate the quick reply.   Did you get the email with the pictures? \u000a\u000aThat way you'll know which Scott I'm talking about and which order exactly I got and which he might have gotten.   \u000a\u000aThank you for the reply VC! 
p65
aVconcerns about JUUL E-Liquid\u000a\u000aI have done a bit of research into the way JUUL Pods create such a powerful buzz compared to normal E-Liquid, but have come up with some concerns that may (or may not) be warranted. Obviously the fact that the JUUL Pods being 50mg/ml is what gives a serious buzz, and that the nicotine used is a form of nicotine salt (monoprotonated nicotine salt). In tobacco, ammonia/ammonium is used to support the nicotine salt until burned, converting it to a base (free-basing nicotine). JUUL has said that they add Benzoic acid in their juice to have the same effect. Is vaping benzoic acid safe? Will the deprotonation of benzoic acid lead to volatile or dangerous compounds? \u000a\u000a
p66
aVJuul - where is it REALLY manufactured?\u000a\u000aWhile comtemplating the price point and light weight of the juul I was wondering if it was made in USA or China. I look on the box and it only says "Designed in San francisco"\u000a\u000aOn their own FAQ:\u000a\u000aWhere is JUUL made?\u000a\u000aJUUL products are designed in San Francisco and manufactured in the United States and internationally under the supervision of our talented engineering team.\u000a\u000a\u000aWhy word it like that? If the parts are manufactured in China just say so! \u000a\u000aAnyone have info on this?
p67
aVI think it's a safe bet that the JUUL is made in China.  The only "part" that is probably made in the US is the e-liquid in the pods themselves.  It's still a good vape I think, I certainly haven't had any issues with mine.  
p68
aVI do like it a lot so far, I just overspeculate about profit margins. Pax 2 is confirmed manufactured in China, so it's likely. It's annoying that they word it like this and no where do they come out and say where Juul is manufactured. Surprised it's not required to state.
p69
aVIt's very Apple-like by stating that it's *designed* in California but foregoing any mention of where it's made.\u000a\u000aI wish I had the income to justify buying only US-made goods. The Juul is inexpensive and well made which is all I really care about currently.
p70
aVI do about the same. My Endura T22 is my desktop and my Juul is my laptop.
p71
aVI want to get my girlfriend into vaping, she's currently using a Juul to stop smoking analogs and this would be the next step. Thanks of the opportunity.

aVHow to quick fix Pax Juul not working on draw\u000a\u000aSo basically the common situation is that when you insert the cartridge in, the LED lights up, but when you draw the LED doesn't light up.\u000a\u000aThis is because e-juice is leaking from the cartridge and soaking into the nubby electrodes in the juul base.\u000a\u000aHowever! If you place your fingers over the diamond window, you seal off the the majority of the airflow. Now when you draw, you'll literally suck the e-juice out of the electrodes. It'll clear the electrical path, and your juul should work again.\u000a\u000aJust rescued mine the same way, hope it helps!\u000a\u000a*EDIT: It'll also improve draw strength, if you want a stronger draw.
p73
aVI can't believe this isn't discussed more. I absolutely love the juul when it works but it's just so inconsistent it infuriates me. The first hit off a fresh pod is amazing then it's mostly downhill from there. I have to take out the pod and reinsert to get a decent draw after that. Also, when a pod is less than halfway, no matter what you do it won't be as strong as the first draw. I've been on the phone with PAX and have gotten replacements but they all are the same or worse. \u000a\u000aIt's such a love hate relationship with this thing.
p74
aVDo you need your original receipt to get a replacement? I bought my juul about a week ago and I don't have my receipt anymore \U0001f612. It charges but it won't hit. 
p75
aVOMG I just resuscitated 3 juuls from my graveyard using this trick! Thank you!!!!
p76
aVThis definitely helps a lot of the time, but occasionally it won't work. There is clearly an issue with their manufacturing process. It doesn't happen all the time, but I'd say I get at least one messed up pod every 1 to 3 packs of 4. That's still unacceptable.\u000a\u000aWhat makes it even more annoying is the fact that their once-excellent customer service just ignores my complaints about the pods (not sure if this is the case with anyone else). Surely they're getting a lot of these complaints, so they must know there is a serious problem.\u000a\u000aI originally thought it was an issue with my battery (which I'd been using for around a year); after all, we're talking about a $30 device (or however much it costs). However, after buying a new battery, I've since had the same problem, which tells me it is definitely the pods.\u000a\u000aHopefully they get this issue fixed. The device is getting more and more popular, and when that happens to products, they can sometimes become lower quality for a number of reasons. I just hope that isn't what's happening with Juul, which is my go-to for when I'm out and about and don't want to be carrying around a bigger set-up.
p77
aVholy shit, i was sitting here getting frustrated at my new juul pods and i did that and now i am happy. My addiction can continue. I applaud you.
p78
aVI have had the problem with the weak juul hits if you cover the top of the pod with your fingers  (the clear plastic part) it creates a tighter seal and makes the hits as strong as a fresh juul pod hit\u000a\u000aHappy juuling!
p79
aVConvert juul to dry herb\u000a\u000aI was experimenting a little bit and doing some research and i havent seen anyone who has tried turning a juul pod into a dry herb pod and i really wanted to know if it can be done, anyone have any ideas?
p80
aVcheck out /r/vaporents for suggestions for the dry herb vapes you are looking for. However given how the juul works and how tiny the battery is on it, I don't think you'll be able to convert it to the purpose you're trying to achieve.
p81
aVNot sure what juul is but you could try modifying an atomizer to work like mflb.  \u000a\u000aE: I think ~~/r/entgineers~~ /r/stonerengineering has mflb builds 
p82
aVI'm really digging my Endura T22 with some 45mg Mr Salt-E nicotine salt liquid. It's my primary device with the Juul as my other device. The Juul is a better experience but the Endura T22 is much cheaper to refill than the Juul.\u000a\u000aLook into nicotine salt liquids. I think the standard freebase liquids suck if your focus is a satisfying nicotine experience. Freebase is also harsher.
p83
aVThe closest I've come is the Juul in that it has serious throat hit and a few hits feel like the first cigarette of the morning, or at least my best memory of.\u000a\u000aI also use an iCare with nic salt juice (from Bombies and Mr. Salt-E) and it does the trick without being quite as harsh as the Juul.
p84
aV100% agree. The Juul is amazing. 
p85
aVAgreed.  \u000a\u000aI have almost quit using mods in favor of the Juul.  I will probably use it even more when I get some flavors other than tobacco.  I will also look into getting some of the MrSalt-E since I have an icare in the mail that will be here tomorrow.
p86
aVTry a Mr Salt-E, high-nic salt juice. I'm loving the 45mg Fruit &amp; Menthol juice in my Endura T22 (which is supposed to be pretty similar to your AIO).\u000a\u000aThe **best** like an analogue ecig is the Juul though. No comparison. Nic salts rock. The Juul tobacco flavor is unexpectedly good too.
p87
aVI'm thinking something similar. I got my mom a Juul for Christmas and she has a bunch of 18mg sitting around, and I just got a RX Mini that might look pretty awesome with a Nautilus. The bartenders at my local bar have said they're cool with us vaping, but with my RDA setup I always feel uncomfortable vaping inside anyway.
p88
aVNautilus on anything. Seconded. I have 1.8 Ohm could running like 12-14 watts. It hits just like a cigarette. The Juul is neat and all, but if you already have a mod you should try a Nautilus or Nautilus mini.
p89
aVThanks! Have you tried the Juul that some other folks in this thread are recommending?\u000a\u000aAlso I'm guessing you use Nicotine Salts to boost the mg/ml level of the Arrakis? What's the advantage of doing this vs. vaping a 30 mg/ml juice?
p90
aVI've used the myjet, juul, and von erl and the Juul is the closest.   
p91
aVI tried the Juul, and I did enjoy it. It was a great little device, and it performed very well. However, the juice selection is quite limited, and I wasn't impressed by any of the flavors that I tried. Granted, the Juul pods are very easy to hack and refill, but they are also much more expensive.
p92
aVThats awsome, my parents both accually started using e ciggerettes before me, the von erls, i try to get them to try out my smok alien and avocado, or with a cleito rta, but it always makes them cough lol, and when i hit their von erls, which is similar to a juul i think, the damn things make me cough. lmao
p93
aVi think juul is good for long time smokers,, maybe..
p94
aVPlease people, don't go suggesting fucking noisy crickets and what not to new people. Suggest the eleaf icares, the juul, things of that nature to people just starting and wanting to quit smoking.
p95
aVHey there, There is a world of Vaping out there! I have been an advocate myself for a time now. YES! There are 'no' and 'low' nicotine vaporizers and e-juice. You being lost is absolutely alright there's a lot of different stuff to learn. From the read, your looking for some type of 'mouth-to-lung' vaporizer maybe? They have a more cigarette feel, less cloud and often more flavor.  Look into the juul possibly? Though, a lot of mouth to lungh have higher nic for quitting smoking. The hardest part is that everyone has their own taste and likes, and really describing the vape and what you want/need from it can be challenging. \u000a\u000aALSO! I recommend looking into #grimmgreen on YouTube. he does reviews and product description how-to's and all the cool stuff between.\u000a

p97
aVThere are literally A TON of devices on the market right now that would suit your needs. Most people here would recommend you something like the Juul, My Von Erl, and Eleaf iCare for starter kits.\u000a\u000aAs you get familiarized with the world of vaping, you might find yourself experimenting with different setups, but that would be a topic for another day. \u000a\u000aPersonally, I'd get the Eleaf iCare. It's simple to use, small like a lighter, and you can try the nicotine salt based juices which would give you that satisfying head rush.

aVHelp with My Von Erl (newbie Vaper)\u000a\u000aHi I am new to vaping and have read very good things about the my von erl does anyone of you experts know how many MG's of nicotine I should get for a nice head rush and not to overpowering throat hit sorta like the Juul thanks sorry for newbie material

aVHow to get my dad onto vaping?\u000a\u000aHey all, I've been on this ecr Reddit for quite some time now but I'm just a lurker and don't really post much.. I was wondering how do I get my dad to start vaping.. I have a bunch of vape related items in my room (my parents don't know what it is), my parents would know that I "smoke" when I introduce to my dad what a vape is. To my parents, vaping and smoking is the same thing because it comes out of your lungs... fml, they would also never understand even if I try to explain to them. What I'm really asking is how do I nicely introduce vaping to my dad because he's been smoking cigs since he was about 13 years old. He's around 50 now... in all honesty I don't really care if they know that I vape because it would get my dad off cigs. I was just wondering if anyone was in this situation before and how did you tell your parents? \u000aAlso from all the information I've read on this Reddit apparently the best starter kits for newbie vapers are the AIO and juul. Does that sound pretty much correct? I want my dad to start off with a mouth to lung vape instead of high end devices and subohm mods.
p100
aVThe Ednura T18 and T22 kits are great for beginners. I wouldnt recommend the juul though. \u000a\u000a\u000aBesides that I can't really help you man. How old are you? You shouldn't have to hide the fact that you vape from your parents
p101
aVWhy not the JUUL 
p102
aVYeah I tried to quit several times (cold turkey) but always found myself going back etc. Once I started vaping I never went back, early on I had a few ciggs here and there while drinking but that stopped soon enough as well. Now I just bring out my JUUL when I'm having some drinks. 
p103
aViCare Mini not charging\u000a\u000aJust got an iCare Mini for Christmas and out the box I think it's busted. When I slide it into the PCC with a micro USB in it. The thing will light up white and red. Then after 15 minutes it just cuts off. It's sitting in there without any lights on. Then when I go to vape it the yellow low battery indicator comes on. I can't charge it fully to green. When I plug it in, the same thing happens. A red light comes on and then disappears after awhile. When I hit it, the indicator light is still yellow. \u000a\u000aThe manual isn't any help either. It's just broken english and vague info about how the light will go out if it's fully charged. I haven't found anything online about the charging procedure. This is why I try and steer clear of Chinese vapor tech.\u000a\u000aDoes anyone have experience with this and what is going on and why the lights won't stay on. I'm using a 1A wall charger and another USB cable since the one that came with it is literally 4 inches long (Although I tested the factory cable and it did the same thing).\u000a\u000aThanks and Merry Christmas.\u000a\u000aEdit: Upon further inspection it appears that the culprit may be the e-juice I'm using. I'm running 45MG Mr. Salt-E and it seems to be turning the green light into a yellowish amber on the glass on the side. I'm an idiot. \u000a\u000aSo in conclusion so far so good, nifty little stealth mod. Way better than spending 40 bucks a week on Juul pods. Build quality seems a little wonky. I would gladly pay double the price for something a little sturdier. \u000a\u000a
p104
aVYou could go with the Juul ecig. It's compact like a cigalike, and it looks fairly easy to use. 
p105
aVJuul is your best bet. I use one myself and vape is extremely satisfying, especially for a recent smoker.
p106
aVThe problem with the Juul that everyone keeps recommending is that it's expensive as fuck for what it is. I'd say go with the eleaf icare. Cheap as dirt online or from the local shop. Cheap coils. Super compact. Not the same shape as a cig but you can hold it and hit it the same way.

aVHelp With Nicotine levels in e-juice\u000a\u000aHello I have been cigarette free for 4 months now all thanks to the JUUL. I am looking to purchase a E-cig and I obviously need Juice, any of you experts here know how many mg's of nicotine I should get to equal the throat hit or feeling of the pre filled JUUL pods?  Thanks y'all. 
p109
aVJuul is special because they use a nicotine salt rather than a nicotine freebase.\u000a\u000aI'm currently using a Juul and an Endura T22 with some Mr Salt-E 45mg juice and I'm really enjoying it. The feel is similar but Mr Salt-E is smoother (which I honestly don't prefer...).\u000a\u000aThe only other company I know of that is using salts in their juice is Bombies.\u000a\u000a
p110
aVI refill my Juul pods using Mr Salt-E 45mg. Justeliquid.com has a sale going on. "holidays" for 20% off. \u000a\u000aI've mastered taking apart Juul pods without tools. 
p111
aVYou'd need someone that has used the JUUL and also recommend you a specific (style) of tank and VG/PG ratio along with the nic levels. PG increases throat hit. Bigger coils create more vapor and may need to be heated at too high of a wattage for what you want despite closing the air flow. I have no experience with the JUUL, but I assume it's a mouth to lung vape.\u000a\u000aIf I had to guess blindly, 12 mg nic with 50/50 VG/PG ratio. Most of my co-workers who switched from cigarettes started here. Most stuck here too. They have mouth to lung tanks too so restricted air flow and not much vapor. I too started here. I never liked the throat hit feeling though, but could stand 12 mg with 50/50. Even if not, I think it's a good place to start because if it's too much or too little, you don't have many more options on either side. Nic changes throat hit and head rush, more PG increases throat hit (harshness varies from person to person). I believe I'm PG sensitive.
p112
aVEither the Endura kit or one of the nextgen cigalikes like the Juul or Von Erl then. If it's just a straight case of replication at this stage, probably the Juul.
p113
aVGet yourself a decent starter kit, a charger, batteries, some juice, some extra coils for whichever atomizer you buy, do it now or before the Holiday Sales are over. Maybe an Ego AIO starter kit, Endura T22, Alien, istick Pico. Or possibly a Juul if your looking for more of a cig alike 
p114
aVJuul.
p115
aVLiked the My Von Erl so much I got one for myself. KILLER starter kit.\u000a\u000aSo I rarely come here anymore (not sure how many of you even remember be but I was either loved or hated because I was honest) but I came and asked what I should get my sis for Christmas to get her off the smokes.   Me and her haven't been too close for years now.. But I hit her up and asked if there was any chance she was ready to quit smoking.. Because she smoked over a pack a day last I knew and she's younger than me at 24.  Mostly for stress I'm guessing.   Anyways I ended up getting her a my von erl.   Carefully took it out of the package to charge it fully in case it wasn't.   I doubt she will even use the tobacco flavor (the kit came with tobacco carts free) so I took a few puffs.   Damn... I liked it a lot more than my Juul which I'm obsessed with.   More vapor, great throat hit (more throat hit than anything but the mint for the juul imo.   Idk what it is but the mint is the only one that gives me that KICK), and it looks and feels really nice.  \u000a\u000aI ordered one for me the same day, with 18mg bird brains (got her 24mg).  Fuck this is good.  I got it today and it's extremely good.   No issues whatsoever.   I'm getting so fucking sick of the juul charger and how hard it is to get it to work after 6+ months of use... I feel like I'll either need to get a new device or new charger every_____months.   I love the micro usb charging of the MVE.   \u000a\u000aIf I run into any issues I'll be sure to write up a review in about a month or so of use.   I'd like to go through a decent amount of pods before reviewing it.   Just took a puff off it and God DAMN it's good.   It feels better in the hands (yeah yeah haha) vapes better, and has better flavors and better pods than the juul.   I like the juul for what it is but this thing might just have my heart.   \u000a\u000aAnd I used to want to buy a new $200+ mech a month.......\u000a\u000aEdit:  and NO DRY HITS so far!   Never got any with the juul either but I've heard a lot of people say they get them on the myjet which was one of my choices I was leaning toward \u000a\u000aThank you /u/so_sic_of_it for the advice.   I love this thing myself, and I fully believe it'll get my sister off the smokes.   She's gonna love the bird brains.   
p116
aVNot for a my von erl \u000a\u000aShe smokes full strength somethings, nearing two packs a day.   24mg will be fine. \u000a\u000a24mg in some shitty Chinese regulated mod with a tfv8 on it is a different story  \u000a\u000aYou do know that the juul pods are filled with 50 something mg juice right? \u000a\u000aI buy bottles of 100mg/ml pg solution to mix with vg or juice for my Juul.   Maybe you don't understand these pod systems but 24mg will be just fine.   If not I'll buy her 18mg because the 24mg will be fine for me 
p117
aVJuul uses nicotine salt solution, so that 50mg is deceptive.
p118
aVI have the Von Earl, Cync, and Juul (thanks /u/so_sic_of_it) and I would like the von earl best if it wasn't for the spit back (they are actually for my wife).  I wouldn't even call it spit back, I would call it leak back.  Its not a little spit, but I get a pool of juice in my mouth 1/10 of the time.  The flavor is better than the others, but the throat hit on the Juul is better IMO.  If I could get rid of the spit back, I would buy another for me and drop my mod full time.
p119
aVAnd like I said, I order nic salts for my Juul to refill the pods  \u000a\u000aI'm vaping a von erl with 18mg bird brains right now.   Trust me she can handle 24.  And if not, I'll buy her 18.  Simple as that 
p120
aVI love my juul and picked up a Von Erl and Myjet because of it.  Gotta say, I really like the von erl too.  The pods are really easy to refill too.
p121
aVHow does it compare to the juul?  \u000aI have been using my juul now more than my 200w mod.  \u000aThe juul pods (at least tobacco) are perfect but the price sucks.
p122
aVIt'll be replacing my Juul... Well, I'll still use the juul but I love the MVE.   Got one for myself and this bird brains is killer.   Even the tobacco that came with the kit is good.   Better than the juul tobacco for sure imo.   I love the feel (I actually like the rectangle juul but it's a tad uncomfortable) love the finish, love the draw.. Love the amount of vapor (it IS more than the juul so if you don't want more vapor stick with the juul) and the BIGGEST improvement is the charging.   Micro USB.   Not the shitty way the juul charges.   Mines already all fucked up.   \u000a\u000aUsing micro USB is the way to go for sure.   
p123
aVI recently got the MVE and have some bottom leakage and mouth spitback issues. Did yours really never have an issue? I've noticed that some pods perform better than others but it's very inconsistent here in QC, Canada (Von Erl subcontracts their production to the country where they sell, i'm assuming it's to facilitate border issues).  \u000a  \u000aAlso, I have 1 pod (out of about 12) that gave me quite a few dry hits. The others just spit juice in my mouth if I pull to hard or frequently.  \u000a  \u000aWhat issues have you found with the Juul? I've been considering getting one even though the unit and the pods are a pain to get in this country. So far the MVE, even though I enjoy it, has left me on my hunger.
p124
aVAbsolutely zero issues with the MVE definitely no spitting or leaking a brand new pod might gurgle a little but you aren't supposed to suck on these things like they're rdas... You're supposed to pull on them softly.   I've never once had juice actually come in my mouth.. \u000a\u000aAs far as the juul, they've had to replace my actual device 3 or 4 times I'll have to check how many dead ones I have... And the charger once.  The way it charges was a horrible idea and even keeping everything clean after a while of using it it took forever to get it to start charging.   Fiddling with it until it was just perfect and the light came on and started pulsing.   Otherwise the flavor selection sucks ass... The pods are easy to refill though so get some 100mg nic salt pg solution and mix it 50/50 with some juice and refill them cheap.   Just use the mint one for any fruit flavors and it will go away after a bit.  Not so much for some of the.. Heavier flavors that stay around much longer.   Less vapor production... The MVE has treated me perfectly and my sister has no complaints as far as I know.   I make sure to keep the device connections as dry as possible.. Keep in mind I've only had it for 6 weeks... Something might happen but who knows. \u000a\u000aI did get one bad pack of pods that would dry hit so I emailed electric tobacconist and they gave me store credit to buy... More than one pack so shout out to them.  \u000a\u000aI fuckin love the thing tbh.   And Mr fritter is possibly my absolutely favorite morning juice... I don't know why but i always find myself reaching for a pod of it in the morning.   Good stuff. I've only tried the three cuttwood flavors (unicorn milk is way way way better in this than dripped I'll tell you that.   The current formula that is who knows what anymore) but they blow all of what the juul offers out of the water.   I mean just way better and was able to get some 30 something mg space jam for free with that store credit so I'll have two new flavors to try.   Bird brains is still my favorite though easily.   Never had issues with leaking AT ALL since I got it.   Will report back if that changes.   If you're having major issues with it contact whoever you got it from  
p125
aVWhere are you located? I think it might be an issue with the supplier here in Qc, Canada. I don't pull that hard on it and have had this problem with 2 different units and many pods.  \u000a  \u000aI'm waiting on some *Fill my pod* tobacco flavour in 45mg to try in my used MVE pods to try and mimic the Juul.  \u000a  \u000aIt's a shame you had so many issues with the Juul, gotta say it's making me weary of getting it out here considering I'll have a hard time getting them to cover the warranty across the border... \u000a  \u000a
p126
aVJust wanted to let you know, randomly after getting a package Saturday, that space jam actually makes some pretty DAMN good juice for the MVE.   And they go up to iirc 36mg.  It's much more like a juul throat hit.  So fucking satisfying but the flavor is SO much better.   I got the (iirc again, sorry at work) particle Z or X or something like that... It's supposed to be like a Blueberry cotton candy I think, and it's fucking DELICIOUS.   And tbh I was surprised.  I got Andromeda which is Blueberry and pomegranate and its also quite good.   \u000a\u000aRight now I took a pod of this cotton candy space jam with me to work and it is just delicious.   I used to LOVE space jam back in the day... Like when they started pretty much.   That far back. Astro was SO Good back then... But man, after they had to change some stuff it was never the same.   I never got a bottle that tasted like it used to.   But these two flavors I give two huge thumbs up.   I don't know if the mixes or ratios are different at all... But man I was surprised.   I bought them for the hell of it just to expand past cuttwood.   Mr fritter is my morning vape every morning.   I just LOVE it in the AM.   Then something lighter and fruitier the rest of the day...   Then I'll use some 18mg at night and take a puff or two every time I wake up to pee or whatever.   \u000a\u000a\u000aI'll definitely be buying more of this particle whatever (cotton candy) in 36mg.  Love love love the throat hit mixed with great flavor.   
p127
aVOnly the custard - if you want something that *doesnt* mask the nic taste go for that - it's a nice enough custard flavor but it doesn't have enough about it to even try to mask the nicotine. I'm at 1.5mg tho, so I've pretty much grown unaccustomed to its taste. As far as effect goes, two little girl hits of the 25mg from a Juul and my head was swimming. 
p128

p130
aVYou cannot go wrong with the Juul, but it is not a do-it-all device so you'll likely need another.
p131
aVUnfortunately I cannot find a Juul e-cig on any Indian stores. \u000a\u000aWhat do you think about [this](https://www.litejoy.co.in/combos/monte-carlo-18650-variable-voltage-advanced-personal-vaporiser-complete-kit)?
p132
aVSo, I don't know much about these vapes such as the JUUL and this? I'm assuming its a really small hit? Does it still have a throat hit at all? I'm interested in possibly getting one.
p133
aVHow popular is Juul in your area?\u000a\u000aI live in Phoenix and it's almost cornered the market among younger users. At ASU it's pretty much the only E-Cig I see, my brother in high school says it's an epidemic there, and pods/starter kits are often sold out at all but a few gas stations. Personally I use one but it's such high nicotine that I get nauseous and an upset stomach if I use it too much, and I might be looking to quit/switch. It's even progressed to the point where you see juul memes on Twitter. Is there a similar phenomenon where everyone lives? 
p134
aVI have never seen anybody with a Juul in my area.

aVI\u2019m starting to pick up on a trend around the JUUL specifically. [There\u2019s even a (pretty funny, IMO) song about it](https://soundcloud.com/bennettc/julio). \u000a\u000aIf what\u2019s happening at ASU is also going on in other places, I\u2019m happy. Well, mixed, really. On one hand, this helps cement the viability of it. One of my fears is that the JUUL fails in the marketplace and I\u2019m out of pods. Seeing this trendiness makes me feel more secure about the long-term success of Pax and of JUUL specifically.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, I don\u2019t want to see it become a lightening rod for \u201cOMG-a-new-generation-of-addicts!\u201d when the most prevalent device on high school campuses turns out to be the JUUL. 
p136
aVAccording to Juul the closest place to Tulsa Ok, which is a pretty fair sized metro, is 60 miles away.  So would say unpopular in our area.  Had to order one from the company for my wife.
p137
aVNever see and Juuls here. I hardly see vapes here. Portland, OR smokes like it's the 90's. Weird, because in Seattle, hardly anyone smokes anymore.
p138
aVI didn't see one until I got to college (in New Orleans) where almost everyone I know either has one or smokes out of other people's actively. These are people that didn't smoke cigarettes that just want to rip the Juul for the crazy head rush -- not to mention it's awesome when you're hammered. It's huge at southern colleges, my friend at Univ. of Alabama says that he has one and that almost everyone in his fraternity does to. Juul is on the rise, big time. 
p139
aVJuul types vs others?\u000a\u000aSo I've been trying Juul for a little while now based on a recommendation for the best cig-alike. I haven't been addicted to nicotine for years now, and only use it while drinking, so my biggest wants are throat hit and mouth feel. \u000a\u000aJuul is the best I tried (vs gas station $10 kits) but I still find myself having a few analogs. Throat hit is great but something missing in the mouth feel (fullness?) \u000a\u000aAny recommendations from here? Are other kits worth it, do they address what I stated? Really tough to figure this stuff out heh\u000a\u000aBudget is $100. No care for vapor production, just the most similar throat hit and mouth feel as analog. Any ideas? \u000a\u000aThanks a lot! 
p140
aVAn MTL setup with some 45mg Mr Salt-E liquid is pretty fucking amazing. It's nicotine salt like the Juul. A slow, dense inhale from my Endura T22 is quite satisfying. It's smoother than the Juul but you can get a denser (fuller maybe?) throat hit.\u000a\u000aI'm really digging the salt nicotines.
p141
aVJuul &amp; Innokin Endura T22. The Endura is pretty good... the coils seem to die fast, but I've only got a week or two of experience with it.
p142
aVJuul is definitely in their own league as for throat hit and mouth feel. Their nicotine salt metabolizes closer to how tobacco is allegedly metabolized from cigarettes. 
p143
aVThat's what I use. Although I alternate between Juul and iCare. iCare produces more vapor, therefore better flavor than Juul.
p144
aVmyMini Or iCare/ICare Mini?\u000a\u000aSo I've been seeing these small, stealth type devices around B&M and online stores and I've always been wanting to try them out. I've done my research of all existing ones (Juul, Von Earl, Myjet, etc.) and I've narrowed down my options to either the icare or the mymini. Dont get me wrong, I love my box mods and the pod thing is a cool concept but the designs of these two are ideal for my daily routine. I was just wondering what the community thinks of these two because I've heard both good and bad things about the icare (Small but powerful, Cheap, but tanks easily cracking, juice dripping out of the usb(even if thats true, wtf), etc) and for the mymini there's barely any reviews but they all seem to be good. which one should I pick up as my stealth vape so I dont have to carry my box mods everywhere I go?
p145
aVInconspicuous E-CIG like JUUL but similar flavor to vaping?\u000a\u000a[deleted]
p146
aVI'm not that familiar with the Juul but the iCare isn't going to give you the same amount of vapor as a bigger kit (if that's what you mean by vape-like). It's a mouth to lung style kit with minimal airflow and tiny coils. 
p147
aVJust ordered the Juul for my wife.  Have heard many people say they have had great luck with getting others to quit.  Seems to be a quick device that just works without much fiddling.  Juice cartridges seem to be almost as expensive as cigs.\u000a\u000aHopefully if the wife likes it can convince her to move on to a more complicated mod.  If not I have it for quick trips in town or when just need that quick nicotine fix.\u000a\u000aSome have success at refilling the cartridges.
p148
aVThe juul is a great device. Also, any choice you make will only work if you truely want to quit . Good luck.
p149
aVGrab yourself a JUUL, closest thing to what you are looking for. I've heard good things about the Von Erl as well but haven't tried it myself, I do own a JUUL however and it's great for going out etc. 
p150
aVJuul definitely has the best throat hit close to a real smoke, just remember that all the pods from every device has a possibility of leaking and getting juice in your mouth. With the Juul getting juice on the contacts makes it not fire for a while. Haven't had this problem with the Erl yet.\u000a\u000aAlso rebuilding coils for the Erl actually work so you can refill the pods. The Juuls are pretty difficult and the leak factor is worse even with brand new pods.
p151
aVThe [Njoy recharge](https://www.njoy.com/products/recharge-economy-kit/0) is cheap, very cigarette-like and their tobacco flavors are pretty authentic. They taste kind of like un-lit cigarettes if that makes sense.\u000a\u000aDifferent flavors have [different nicotine levels](https://www.njoy.com/faq), so choose accordingly. If you smoke a lot, you'll want to go with the Bold tobacco, if you don't smoke so much, you may like the Gold tobacco better. The Menthol is also very authentic and appropriately disgusting/delicious, depending on your feelings about menthol cigarettes.\u000a\u000aI keep a Recharge kit around as a back up, or for when I want some high-nic. They say one flavor chamber is equal to a pack of cigarettes, and that seems pretty accurate to me. They also come in a really cool, Zippo-style case. I think for traditional cigalikes (not the pod sticks like the Juul, which I haven't tried) they're the best around.\u000a\u000aLast time I checked, the code DISCOUNT30 was good for 30 percent off.\u000a\u000a
p152
aVI like the look of these better than the JUUL.\u000a\u000aAre e-cigs better for me? (my lungs)
p153
aVThey're definitely more cigarette like than the Juul, aesthetically. I haven't tried the Juul, but I can vouch for the Njoy Recharge. \u000a\u000aBetter than smoking? Definitely less harmful. You can pick up a Recharge kit for about $10.50 with the discount code, so nothing to lose by trying it out. You'll eventually want to upgrade from there, but the point now is to get you off cigs, so just start seeing what works!
p154
aVI still don't own a "proper" mod (just a Juul &amp; Endura T22). I'd like to return the Dripbox 160 &amp; Arctic sub-ohm tank to my friend who let me borrow it.\u000a\u000aThanks OP!
p155
aVOr pick up a Juul
p156
aVAdvice on a setup for someone trying to quit the JUUL\u000a\u000aSup gang, I have been smoking the Juul for about 3 months now but I want to ween myself off of it due to the ridiculously high nicotine content in each pod (50mg or 5% by volume) -- so I have done my research on a box mod. Ultimately I want to purchase a small mod that I can fit in my pocket and take with me on the go, in my car, etc. I really do not want one of those big bulky mods with all of the fancy settings.. I could seriously care less about that. I also would prefer not to have to get the whole 18650 battery setup with the charger as well; therefore all of the mods listed below do not require one.\u000a\u000aI would wholeheartedly appreciate any advice because I am such a noob when it comes to this as I really have only been browsing this community, r/vaping, and the rest of the internet for a few days now. I've narrowed my options down to these: \u000a\u000a- RXmini 80w \u000a\u000a- SMOK OSUB 40w \u000a\u000a- Kanger TOGO Mini \u000a\u000a- Tesla Stealth Mini 45W\u000a\u000a- Mega Volt\u000a\u000a\u000aEach of these would be the starter kits because I don't really know what tanks work well/I don't have any pre-existing tanks/coils to place into the mod itself. If you have any other suggestions for mods or mods setup, it would seriously be appreciated.\u000a\u000aThanks, have a good one. 
p157
aVHave you considered the eleaf icare? Much better device that he Juul , imo, but still small and pocket friendly. Not super advanced and refills easy. 
p158
aVWhat you are looking for is the sbody elfin dna75. I am a juul user myself and alternate between the juul and the sbody with various 22mm tanks attached, using 6mg to 9mg ejuice. Lately I prefer the pico-s RTA. 
p159
aVJuul and the Von Erl for me.  I've found them to be quite enjoyable with the new nicotine salt juices available.  \u000a\u000aAlso a big fan of the kanger protank 4 on an IP5.  That's been my daily driver for a while.  \u000a\u000aSquatchberry by Yetivape is a nice juice.  
p160
aVIt's a salt nicotine (like the Juul) so it's much smoother than the standard freebase nicotine.
p161
aVDoes he want to try vaping?    \u000a\u000aIs he interested in quitting?    \u000a\u000aIf he wants to use vaping as a means to stop smoking then you can consider getting him something.   \u000a\u000aFor a two pack a day smoker , I would buy them two JUUL kits and wish them the best.
p162
aVJuul is they way to go. Upgrade later if he gets into vaping.
p163
aVMy old father, wasn't a fan of the Juul and up until about a month ago was still rocking Ego batteries with Nautilus Mini's. His favorite tank is without a doubt the Nautilus Mini, as for mods, he still likes his Vision Spinners (easier for him to pack while traveling) and this little Eleaf 20/40 watt box. For some reason, both of my parents can't stand the nicotine salts, which is no problem for me so I inherited both of their Juul's \u005co/ Most vape shops in the Chicago area here have Juul's for you to try, so find one of those &amp; let him try it. If he likes it, yeah like everyone said, Juul. If he doesn't, and isn't a pot smoker, Nautilus Mini or 2 and an Ego or 2, or a small Eleaf box. 
p164
aVYeah unfortunately I have 0 time to diy these days, and if/when I do have time, I'd honestly rather spend it doing something that I don't do 9+hrs a day every day anyways haha. I've put out over 27k orders myself, mixing and bottling every single bottle and it sure does get tiring. With regulations the way they are at the moment, it's just not worth my time at the moment either. Also, I originally started diy as a cheaper alternative to store juice, which I then got super submersed into the hobby, then got convinced to turn it into a business (thanks everyone who convinced me). All of this was really to 100% quit smoking cigs, I was definitely hooked on the cigs (up to 3pad smoker before I started vaping) and it had to stop. Vaping helped me completely quit smoking (2.5yrs 100% tobacco free going strong) and I plan on quitting vaping sometime in the near future. I can quit vaping at the moment with no problems, I've stopped for days on end with no heavy cravings or anything. I honestly just enjoy it and it sure does help with the amount of stress I deal with on a day to day basis. \u000a\u000a\u000aAnyways, back on topic lol. I totally know what you mean, I'm definitely a ton more sensitive to nic now compared to back when I was vaping higher nic. I just purchased several juuls for friends and family who I haven't been successful getting off smoking with open tank devices. I tried one of them out after I gifted it to a friend and surprisingly the nicotine wasn't irritating constricting feeling like higher nic (6+mg) normal eliquid is for me. I did get one hell of a buzz of a single hit, but the nic wasn't near as bad as I expected it to be. \u000a\u000aMaybe pick up a myjet or something and give some juice with nic salts a try? Maybe get some mr salt eliquid in 25mg and see how it helps out. Or you could go the cheaper route and try out 1mg or 1.5mg and see how you do with it. I usually vape 0.5mg, but vape on 3mg every once in a while just for that extra kick. I haven't experienced going up to 3mg every once in a while making me want to vape any more or making me feel more addicted. As long as I just use it whenever I feel necessary it doesn't really make much of a difference for me personally. Sorry for the text wall haha
p165
aVHonestly, abstinence stresses me out. My objective is not to never smoke a cigarette, but to never be *addicted* to cigs again. I've probably had 15 cigs in the past 4 or 5 years.\u000a\u000aI've been using my Endura T22 with some 45mg Mr Salt-E Fruit &amp; Menthol lately and it **really** good from a "like a cig" perspective. The Juul is good too.
p166
aVYes. Haven't smoked in 3+ years and every now and then the old addiction will be like "hey fucker remember me?"  Pick up a device like a Juul for such times.
p167
aVSometimes setups like that can be intimidating!  Have you considered an iCare or a Juul?  Ease them in to it!
p168
aVI agree with the comment above. When I first became interested in ecigs, I used GreenSmoke cigalikes for a while, as it felt like analogs. I then was introduced to vaping. But the first time I saw a box mod, I was adamant that I did not want one as it did not look/feel like cigs (to me). I eventually got an eLeaf iStick PICO 75w kit, and it eased me into the world of vaping. I'm now looking to purchase my 3rd mod and each one gets bigger and more powerful than the last. There are so many new devices on the market now, like the eLeaf iCare Mini (as mentioned above), or the JUUL, and others. These might be a good stepping stone for your cuz.
p169
aVI'm curious what part of India will you be in? \u000a\u000aA Juul, icare or another compact equivalent might be a better idea to bring along.  
p170
aVThe ones that imitate the aesthetics of a cigarette are no good. If she doesn't mind a simple look, check out the Eleaf iCare, JUUL, or myJet.
p171
aVHave a look at juices made with nicotine salts - they're typically used for pod refills for the likes of the Juul - Mr Salt do a 25 and a 50mg, Bombies...I can't remember, and Cloud Alchemist do their stuff in 30mg format which *might* be doable in a Nautilus if you're careful.
p172
aVFirst thing to keep in mind - a hit on your vape does not equal a drag on a cig. The way nicotine hits the brain is vastly different when you are breathing in medicated air vs. combustion.  The MVP is a dated mod, but still pretty stable. The Aspire Nautilus was a great tank for its age....2-3 years ago! That's like using a Pentium I computer today. Things have changed dramatically in the industry since then, I would urge you to consider a new tank. I won't give my opinions on that, since I am a vape shop owner and subject to subjectivity. Also, don't be afraid of taking a lot of vapes to make up for the different in nicotine delivery. A hundred hits off your atomizer is still better than a handful of hits from the cigarette. I would try salt-based nicotine, they have been hugely successful lately and offer 45mg nicotine strength, without the need for a large and cumbersome device. They don't even feel harsh on the throat. Nicotine delivery via 45mg natural salts is better than 24mg regular e-juice, although there is no science currently to back that up. People have been using the JUUL with great success, and JUUL uses nicotine salts. 
p173
aVGet yourself a Juul for work is probably easiest 
p174
aVYou could go the juul route. My gf loves hers. Idk if you want something like that, but it's as compact as you can get
p175
aVIf you do go this route, the MyJet is a pain in the ass. Stick with Juul or some of the newer ones. 
p176
aVPax makes a fairly sleek looking e cig called the "Juul". It doesn't look like most traditional vapes. It's small and easy to use. It takes refillable pods. It uses a highly concentrated nicotine e liquid that uses nicotine salts instead of traditional e liquid nicotine. The liquid in the Juul pods gives it much more of a smoking experience.
p177
aVGet the juul, made by same company as the pax. It's a great option for people that don't like the vape pen or box mod aesthetics really. 
p178
aVThe juul is also made by the pax. It looks like the "apple" of vapes. Very nice and very beginner friendly.
p179

aVFriends grandpa vape suggestion\u000a\u000aHi, I had a question regarding trying to get someone to stop cigs at the age of 68. He started at the age of 14 and has been going ever since slowing it down to 1 or 2 cigs a day. I was wondering what are the best options that will crave it besides the juul? Thanks! :)\u000aI have my mind set on the juul but I want to hear from you guys your experience with the juul or anything else that removed your need for a cig.\u000a\u000a (Looking for something like the juul or mouth to lung. Age 68)
p181
aVuhm... juul\u000a\u000abut I'm gonna let someone else chime in, I'd suggest there's an alternative because it's 2016 and perhaps get him something different for christmas..
p182
aVJuul is still so valid here. It's so easy and no hassle tech wise. Would be a great place to start. 
p183
aVI first learned of this when researching the Juul. They use nic salts.\u000a\u000aThe only eliquid I know of that uses salts is Mr Salt-E. You could always buy 0mg eliquid and add the nic salts yourself. Nude Nicotine sells nic salts.
p184
aVI've really gotta try Bombies. Very cool that they have a salt option.\u000a\u000aand yeah... I dunno about sub-ohming nic salts. I'd like to try it though. According to Juul's literature, even their super-special nic salt eliquid is still slightly slower at getting into the bloodstream than actual cigarettes, so nic salts shouldn't be any more dangerous to the heart than the nic rush cigs offer. Of course, it's good to be cautious...
p185
aVThe coil on your vaporfi tank is probably burnt out, that is why it isn't working.   \u000a\u000aReliable draw activated devices are compared in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/50w59e/the_juul_icare_and_myjet_thoughts_on_each_device/?ref=search_posts).  \u000a\u000aI like the juul but that is the only one I have tried out of those three.   \u000a\u000aWe just got the icare in my shop I work at and it seems a little complicated to fill and change coils but a nice design in general .   
p186
aVTarkin likes Juul so much he put pods on his uniform
p187
aVI cant vouch for this personally, but reviewers I trust recommend https://www.juulvapor.com/shop-juul these. The throat hit is very cigarette-like and vapor is close to a sub ohm device while retaining a more cig-a-like form factor. It's at least worth considering\u000a\u000aP.s. It may also help to know that when I first started switching to e-cigs, it took quite a long time to stop smoking tobacco alongside them. Sometimes after I used the e-cig I would be like "well that was nice...I could really go for a cigarette now". So dont expect a hard-switch right away, is what I'm saying. As one's lungs adjust to the vapor it makes e-cigs more attractive and tobacco less, but it takes time and usage
p188
aVI know you already have aa device, but a Juul by Pax mimics a cigarette nicely.  High nic content, and their tobacco taste "cigarette-y".\u000a\u000aYou can also buy juice now to refill them.
p189
aVMost of your 1+ ohming is being done in things like the juul, von erl, myjet, and icare these days. Definitely a small minority of people building their own 1+ ohm coils.
p190
aVIMO what got me off of cigs and into vaping was my purchase of a JUUL. Hands down.
p191
aVIt's no problem and you're welcome! A [JUUL](https://www.juulvapor.com) is a cig-alike that's, in my opinion, the most pleasant one out there. The flavors are nice, the amount of vapor produced is perfect, and you feel like you're inhaling something without having a harsh bitter throat experience. Like I said, it helped me and I was really iffy about the whole "vape" thing and if it would actually work with me. Because of the JUUL, it did. Since then, I've graduated to bigger more complicated things like mech mods, building, blah blah blah, but it was definitely a factor in my whole journey out of smoking cigarettes.
p192
aVI believe the cartridges are meant to die. Try looking into the juul it has pods that are refillable and some companies are selling the nicotine salt liquids to refill with
p193
aVI don't want to invest tons of money into vaping nor do I want it to become a hobby. I just want a **convenient and simple** setup that offers tons of nicotine with some flavor, so I've got an Endura T22 and a Juul.\u000a\u000aOver-sized, expensive mods aren't for everyone. I've tried my friend's ~~IPV4~~ IPV5 with high-end tanks and it's not what **I** want. You've got to respect that there are more perspectives than your own...
p194
aVI have had the MyVonErl for about a month now and that part about the liquid getting in your mouth is possible from every device. Usually its at the start if the pod is too cold and you take a tight draw the coil doesnt heat up enough to vaporize the liquid. Happens with the Juul also.\u000a\u000aThe coils can be rebuilt pretty easily using 32ga kanthal and anything over 18mg nic gives a pretty nice hit. One trick that I found is that if you cut the tabs for the top of the pod it makes it easier to slide off. Before I take a draw I just take off the top and see if there is any liquid sitting at the top that may have leaked over. Havent had any liquid in my mouth in about 2 weeks since doing that. Best of luck.
p195
aVHave a look at the new generation of cigalikes - the Juul/Von Erl/myjet/Icare - someone did a direct comparison review of them over the last couple of days - maybe /u/so_sic_of_it, but I wouldn't swear to it. Search 'juul' and sort by new and you should pick it up.
p196
aVThanks, is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/50w59e/the_juul_icare_and_myjet_thoughts_on_each_device/) the thread you were mentioning?\u000a\u000aThe Juul sounds kinda nice, though I'm a bit concerned when he says that it is kind of a stealth vape. That makes me think the smoke cloud will be barely visible, which is important to me from a psychological aspect. It also sounds like the cartridges are really expensive.
p197
aVMost of the cartridge-style cigalike devices are going to be more expensive to run than something like an eGo AIO, but they mimic the design/feel of a cigarette pretty well. So if that's something important to you, they're the best options.\u000a\u000aFrom what I've seen about the Juul, calling it a "stealth vape" is because you can blow pretty similar clouds to a cigarette if you want, or you hold it in for 5-10 seconds and absorb all the vapor. They don't mean that you can never get clouds with it, just that if you're in a place where smoking isn't allowed, you can still get away with it.
p198
aVPax Juul. Or the others /u/throwymcsock suggested.
p199
aVThat's the one. Remember when he says 'stealth vape' its compared against the 200w things that blow weather systems that you can get for $50 these days - I've used a Juul briefly and the output's pretty comparable to a fag. The cartridges *are* expensive but there's a few companies come out with high mg nicotine Salt juices to refill them - Bombies, Mr Salt and Cloud Alcehmist are the ones that spring to mind. If we say $20 (roughly) for a 30ml bottle, then Juul pods are 0.7ml each, so that $20 buys you...(can't math)...somewhere about 40 pods worth of refill.
p200
aVIt'll never be chucking big clouds like most of the 18650 mods out there, but if it breaks you off the cigarette ritual, that's a **HUGE** step in the right direction. Breaking the habit of smoking always seems to be more difficult than the actual smoke, so the Juul (or the other cigalikes) could help with that.\u000a\u000aYou can always get a more powerful setup later on. :-)
p201
aVThe Juul is the **best** if you want to feel the vapor in your lungs. Nothing beats it.
p202
aVIt would be a lot cheaper in the long-run to have a tank like that that you fill yourself.\u000a\u000aYou can pick up a 120mL bottle for $20ish, which is the equivalent of almost 200 Juul pods, iirc.\u000a\u000aThe most important thing, though, is if it helps solve your cravings and gets you off the sticks.
p203
aVIt's more about the eliquid itself. I've got some 45mg Mr Salt-E Fruit &amp; Menthol in my Endura T22 and it's good but the Juul is still much better from a "hits like a cigarette" perspective.
p204
aVSounds more like they are getting into the sex toy industry with a name like vibe.   \u000a\u000aI have tried the vuse but not the vibe, my impression was that it worked for getting nicotine but the flavor was terrible, I like the juul a lot more.
p205
aVI agree - Juul is where it's at if you want a convenience store ecig.  I think OP would be pleasantly surprised with an Endura T18 or the like.
p206
aVYeah I bring my JUUL with me when I head out, I couldn't keep it as my daily but it's great for nights out. 
p207
aVThe icare, myjet, or juul are my favorite non hobby, simple, easy to use options. Imsuggest one of those. 
p208
aVFinding the right setup (xpost from r/vaping101)\u000a\u000aSo I'm mostly newish, bf is a very experienced vaper and he has all of these boxes and tanks and some of them are so scary and intimidating. I keep trying (and wasting money on) different setups/starter kits etc and i just haven't found the right fit yet.\u000aI set out looking for something on the smaller side that is easy to transport in a pocket/purse/etc something that isn't super big or scary or that i would choke on the vapor. First, I tried the Kangertech subvod, i liked that it was tubey and shaped more like a cigarette, but it leaked and popped and spitback and all that fun stuff.\u000a\u000aThen i tried the eGo aio box, this one also leaked, which surprised me since the juice goes right into the box.\u000a\u000aI thought i hit the jackpot with the icare mini, no buttons, easy to fill and charge, very portable but it feels like i'm sucking in juice every time i hit it, it's not pleasant.\u000a\u000aI also had the bf test them out to make sure I wasn't doing it wrong because that isn't out of the realm of possibility.\u000aSo anyway, I would really like to switch from smoking to vaping but does anyone have a suggestion that might work for me? i feel like maybe i'm being too picky, but I really enjoy cigarettes, i want to get that same enjoyment from vaping and I know the right vape has to be out there without me wasting my whole paycheck trying to find out.\u000a\u000aI have been looking at the Juul, since it's made by Pax and I do like my pax but I wasn't sure if the pod setup would be any different than the ecigs you can get at any convenient store so if anyone has an opinion on those I'd love to hear it too.\u000aAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much !
p209
aV I read a post recently by /u/So_sic_of_it where he tested a bunch of the small vapes like the Icare, Juul an others an found he really liked the MyJet vape.\u000a\u000aI might take a look at that one myself too in new year.\u000a\u000aEdit:words\u000a
p210
aVSeriously, the Juul is great. The pods are kinda expensive but the ejuice in them is amazing. It's not really an all day device though. You can get it for like ~$35 (with 25% off) on the official Juul site so it's really a no-brainer. The flavors are good, but they are different from normal vaping flavors... Initially I didn't like the flavors but now I love them.\u000a\u000aI've tried refilling the Juulpods with Mr Salt-E 45mg but it's not as good as the stock ejuice. I have been really enjoying Mr Salt-E in my Endura T22 though.
p211
aVI was looking at the my jet vape as well, it didn't get as good of reviews as the juul.   Here in MA you can't test them in the store, I wish there was a place to go to test different ones, I'll definitely check out that review, thank you
p212
aVJuul? It's not a great device for all day, heavy use but it doesn't put out much vapor and the eliquid is incredible. Even my non-vaping friends think it's awesome.\u000a\u000aAside from that there's a bunch of AIOs &amp; cigalikes that you can find reviews for with a quick Google and YouTube search. None of them are perfect, so that's why I'm mentioning checking the reviews for yourself. They all have their own drawbacks.
p213
aV&gt;Myjet? Anyone have one and like it?\u000a\u000aI still need to stop being lazy and actually type up my review, but last month I tested several of the MTL cigalike devices including the MyJet, JUUL, Cync, iCare, and Von Erl. Out of all of them, the MyJet was my clear winner. Better flavor than anything else I tried, very small and light (only the JUUL was smaller and lighter), relatively inexpensive, and easy to fill/refill. Several friends and family members of mine are getting a MyJet, a pack of pods, and a few bottles of Cloud Alchemist's specialty pod refill juice for Christmas this year.\u000a\u000aThat would be my recommendation for sure.
p214
aVSeconded. You may also choose something like the Endura T18/22, Eleaf iCare, Juul, Wismec MyJet, My Von Erl, and various beginner devices that suit your needs. 
p215
aVI would get a nice cigalike maybe for example the juul has high nicotine and a nice mouth the lungh hit
p216
aVI'm pro-vaping but from a simplicity and nicotine experience perspective, cigarettes win. Yeah, from a flavor perspective, vaping wins but the idea that vaping is better in every way is nonsense.\u000a\u000aJuul has made some progress with their superb nic salt juice but we've got a long way to go before vaping will be better in every way. Until then, many people will continue using cigs even though they know vaping is likely healthier.
p217
aVYeah, for me, the cig craving whilst drinking is probably the worst. The Juul has been incredible in that area though. I still like a cig when camping and/or drinking though.\u000a\u000aCurrently, I think I'm gonna have some low-nic (or no nic?) DTL setup for flavor and a high-nic MTL setup for nicotine.
p218
aVIf your reading this thinking this is the device to finally get you to quit smoking, it's not. Get the Juul. 
p219
aVI don't think anyone in their right mind would try to quit smoking by immediately going for an RTA that does its best work above 100W... nor did I mention it would be a good choice. Plenty of other options like the Juul, the iCare or the Endura to start vaping.
p220
aVNot just to start, but to finish. Juul is the finish line, before quitting altogether.
p221
aVLeaving 2012 and arriving to 2016 would be a start. Go get an AIO, icare, my jet, juul, von erl... something that is present tech will go along way.
p222
aVIt is not realistic to look at synthetic nicotine in relation to the deeming regs in a vacuum, as the scope of the regs expands well past this argument alone.\u000a\u000aFrom what I have read and heard, yes, synthetic nicotine has a high likelihood of being excluded from the regulations as a stand alone product.  However, before everyone goes jumping for joy and sinking their life savings into NextGen Labs stock, you need to look at the other side of the equation - equipment.\u000a\u000aThe deeming regs classify any equipment (mods, tanks, coils, etc) that could feasibly have their intended use be for the vaporization of tobacco products (current e-juice) as a tobacco product.  By this logic, everything that is available on the market today is a tobacco product.\u000a\u000aNow- to circle back around to juice made with synthetic nicotine - even if the product in question does not utilize tobacco in its production, if the intended use pairs up with an existing tobacco product then, by association, this product is also a tobacco product.  \u000a\u000aTo give the logic table for this:  Ejuice contains tobacco and therefore is a tobacco product.  MOD/tank is used in the vaporization of Ejuice, and therefore is also a tobacco product.  Synthetic and 0nic ejuice utilizes MOD/tank (which is a tobacco product), and therefore is ALSO A TOBACCO PRODUCT.\u000a\u000aThe logic circles are senseless, but it is how the FDA interprets their regs.\u000a\u000aHOWEVER, if a closed tank system is made that entails entirely proprietary design (ie: no 510) and cannot feasibly be utilized with an existing tobacco product MABYE it will not fall under the deeming regs.\u000a\u000aThink Juul style device that is only packaged from the manufacturer without tobacco derived nicotine in any capacity.  That is the only realistic way in which there is a shed of possibility to fall outside the scope of the regs - and even that is not a guarantee per the FDA.
p223
aVTL;DR - but get the juul, downside is its expensive and hard to get. Upside is its the closest youll get to a cig while still being a vape. Next thing you can do is get a similar device with nicotine salts, it won't be the same but you can achieve similar results. Icare?
p224
aVPossibly. I've tried [[ Bedrock ]] and [[ Crme brle ]] through the Endura and it's got muuuuch less flavor than my Arctic. Disappointing...\u000a\u000aI tried my 45mg Mr Salt-E Fruit &amp; Menthol (bought for my Juul) and it's pretty good. Tastes practically the same as through my Juul. I dunno if that's a good or bad sign... \u000a\u000aI thought MTL was supposed to have more flavor. I'm still gonna stick with the Endura but I'll need to find flavors that work with it. I'm really enjoying Mr Salt-E high-nic juice, so I'll definitely be trying out a few more of their flavors.
p225
aVChapelle confirmed JUUL User\u000a\u000aNice to see Dave found something to replace the smokes, loving the new special on Netflix!
p226
aVI'm convinced. I'm buying a dozen Juuls and throwing them in with the rest of my **Y2K** emergency kit.
p227
aVIt's a Juul.
p228
aVthanks!\u000a\u000ai was wondering if it was a juul, for some reason i couldn't picture dave using one
p229
aVDave Chappelle\u000a\u000aOne of us.  Looks like he is  vaping a Juul in his new Netflix special.
p230
aVYeah its my only mod atm besides the Juul. So for now I will just go for 1k again and hope the counter ticks over
p231
aVConfused about the Vuse Vice Nicotine Content\u000a\u000aSo i've been using the Vuse Vibe the past few weeks to curb a dipping a habit and overall I have found the product to be quite enjoyable. However, after doing some research, I have learned that this product contains an extremely high nicotine content at 48mg, which is 4x as much nicotine as a pack of cigs. Does that really mean that one cartridge of the Vube Vibe is the equivalent of smoking FOUR packs of cigarettes? That is pretty worrying to me I typicaly finish a cartidge in 2-3 days and I was no where near &gt;pack a day smoker in the past. Also, is this nicotine content similar to the Juul, which has .7ml of nicotine? I just want to know what I am putting in my body and whether I should consider using a different product to curb my tobacco cravings. 
p232
aVThe Juul uses like 54mg nicotine salts and only contains .7ml per pod. 
p233
aVcan you explain the difference between nicotine salts and freebase nicotine? Does this difference make the Vuse more or less potent than the nicotine contained in a Juul? 
p234
aVDoes Chain Vaping burn out pods? (pod mods)\u000a\u000aHey guys,\u000a\u000aI've searched as much as I can and tried to read through all the resources. This is pretty much my last plea in order to figure something out for my current smoking set up...\u000a\u000aI've messed around with different juices with different PG/VG ratios, pulled on the cartridges while blocking the air intake, and even filled pods and left them overnight.\u000a\u000aI've come to the unfortunate conclusion that it may just be simply my vaping etiquette that's been causing my pods to burn out. \u000a\u000aCan anyone with experience with pod mods please give some insight on this issue? Is this why the rest of y'all are on Rebuildable Atomizers? Is this how it's going to be when looking for a Juul/Phix replacement? \u000a\u000aI'm awaiting a shipment on a couple more devices that will hopefully solve my issue (Kimsun being temperature controlled), but I just find it very unbelievable that everyone seems to be content with their pod mods while I am here trying out 4-5 new cartridges only to find inconsistent and bad results. \u000a\u000aI'd really appreciate some answers! I know this subreddit gets a lot of troubleshooting questions but I'd really like someone with experience to just science the shit out of me! 
p235
aVThanks so much. At this point I'm just about to go to my local gas station and buy a Juul. 
p236
aVEx-Smoker, Switched To A Suorin Air - How Am I Supposed To Taper Down My Nicotine With A Pod Device?\u000a\u000aIt's not like I can just switch from 12mg to 9, 6, 3, it only comes in 40mg salts... Like the JUUL. How do I taper down? 
p237
aVCould it be the device? I have even used a juul before which I believe are 50mg and it didn't feel like this
p238
aVAccording to a lil research, the Breeze runs around 35 watts while the Juul is at roughly 9. Still, I find it strange. My only other idea is that you're actually burning cotton instead of vaporizing juice, but you'd be able to tell if that was the case. 
p239
aVWhat's your Favorite MTL Pod system, why, and how much a month do you spend on it?\u000a\u000aCurrently I have a Juul, I'm using roughly 30$ a month on 8 pods a month, and while I love it, I find my pod consumption is starting to rise. One thing I use to justify the cost of pods is the customer service from Juul/Pax, they are very helpful and it seems to sort of make the price of pods hurt less. That said I'm looking for more options. \u000a\u000aSadly there isn't much out there that seems to be as small and light as the Juul that's refillable (besides trying to refill used pods, something I haven't done... yet) so until something like that comes around, I was wondering what the other people here use for pod systems. \u000a\u000aI'm ideally looking for something open, as close to the size, shape and weight of the juul (if not well, if it's reliable as hell I don't mind) or if it's closed, how many pods do you go through a month, how available are they and sell me on why I should switch from the Juul. \u000a\u000aEven if you don't have recommendations for my question, I'd still like to hear what everyone else out there is using for MTL Pod systems, cost per month on average, and why you use that one over any of the other options out. \u000a\u000aedit: If you don't feel like sharing the financial aspect, you by no means are obligated to. I usually don't like to ask questions like that, but with these devices it seems relevant and non offensive in this context. If you don't want to divulge this information though, you don't have to, that's understandable and completely okay.
p240
aVHelp purchasing first ecig\u000a\u000aI've recently been looking to buy my first all-in-one device as I'm trying to quit smoking.  I am looking for something small and portable that will get me through the day. I've heard good things about the Suorin Air and Aspire Breeze.  I've also looked at the iCare 2 but heard pretty consistent negative reviews about it. A lot of my friends have a Juul, but I'd rather stay away from that to have something easier to refill with juices. I'd appreciate any feedback with experiences that you may have had with these or something similar that you'd recommend. Thanks!
p241
aV&gt; I've heard good things about the Suorin Air\u000a\u000aThey've been lying to you, albeit unknowingly. Do a search for them on this subreddit. Roughly half a dozen posts each day about them breaking in various ways. Twice that when high school isn't in session.\u000a\u000aJuul is a popular pod system. You don't have to refill it or anything, just put a new pod in.\u000a\u000aPersonally, I feel the refillable kits to be worth the savings.\u000a\u000a
p242
aVIf you find that your set-up is not doing it for you and you're tempted to buy a pack of cigs and alternate to 'ween' yourself off cigs, get a Juul instead.  You can go to Juul.com and see where they're sold near you.  The buzz and cigarette feel is very close to smoking.  \u000a\u000aIt's a very expensive system (not more than smoking though, relatively), but in my experience most smokers try to switch to vaping, get a set-up that doesn't *quite* satisify them, they decide not to *totally* quit smoking (use vaping to taper off), and eventually they're back to smoking again.\u000a\u000aThe Juul will help get you through the nic fits and help the transition to vaping.
p243
aVIf by premium you mean literally any juice that's not manufactured in house then you're wrong. If you mean actual premium juice lines then yeah, you're likely right. \u000a\u000aI think we have very very different definitions of absurd. I personally wouldn't have any issue with a shop adding nic. Or  menthol crystals. Or filling Juul pods. I don't know too many people who would have an issue with that either, but there's like 2 diy'ers including myself in my friend group so customizing juice to taste is fairly commonplace amongst our group. 
p244
aVReccomendations for Nic-Salt MTL devices?\u000a\u000atl;dr: reccomend nicotine salt devices. \u000a\u000aI currently own a DRAG and Druga. I'm looking for something that I can take to work. I had a JUUL for about 8 months and it recently died - finally. I didn't like the juul since I couldn't refill the pods. I tried multiple times but the pod would burn very quickly and become useless. I've been looking at devices like the suorin drop, and air. As well as possibly picking up a MTL RTA and building it high and using salt liquid in it. I wanted to get reccomendations from all of you guys first.
p245
aVDepending on how many coils and devices you go through the Juul may be not much more expensive.
p246
aVFinally found my perfect device\u000a\u000aStarted off a long time ago when the only vaporizes were those cheap disposable cigarette look alikes or those tanks that were about the same performance. Gave up on then since they were no good. Then came the time of all the box mods which I enjoyed but we're too big to carry around so I abandoned that as well. Now (or atleast now is when i found out about them) here are so many small sub ohm devices that I can see myself sticking with the [Aspire Breeze](https://i.imgur.com/zQ1owsH.jpg) since it gives me the vapor and flavor of those box mods while still being pocket sized. I also have a  juul on the way and was wondering if someone has experience with both that can tell me some pros and cons of each?
p247
aVClosed system like Juul will always cost more. From what I hear, however, they have good customer service at least.
p248
aVHaven't tried them yet but from what I've read so far they seem to offer a different nic experience that's closer to a cigarette than freebase nic. That certainly seems to be the case with the Juul pods, people say it's the closest thing to the nic buzz of a cigarette on the market. Another good thing about nic salt juice is that you don't have to vape it as often as regular juice because the nicotine levels are usually higher. Most commercial nic juices I see these days are either 25mg, 40mg, 40mg or 50mg. It's more like a cigarette, you take 10 puffs and you're good to go. Definitely worth picking up a bottle and testing it out, that's what I'm doing.\u000a\u000a90% VG will be problematic in the Aspire Breeze, it won't wick that well and you may get dry hits. 70%VG or lower seems to be the best. 
p249
aVI came from smoking spirits and even I think that smoking a black pack of spirits feels less harsh than hitting a juul. The cigarette won't even give me a head buzz but the juul will
p250
aVI don't have the breeze, but I do have a Juul. First thing I say is when you get yours, register it. This will make it so if you have problems with it, they will replace it for you (you may or may not have to send it back). They have good customer service, I've dealt with them firsthand and it's been a pleasure.\u000a\u000aThe downside is the pods can get to be a bit expensive, I spend more than I would like to admit on them, but I would be lying if I said that I didn't love the shit out of that device and the way the nic salt formula they use hits you is the closest thing I've found to a vape as satisfying as a cigarette. It's prevented a few times where I almost lit one up, so I don't mind paying the extra money (although I am about to look into some open systems, because it's starting to hurt the wallet). 
p251
aVAlright thanks for the help, I'm planning on using a juul or something like it to quit cigs and wanted to get some info on them first.
p252
aVJuuls are a great start imo, though isn't much cheaper than cigs. I'd recommend starting with a Juul and if you like it buy something like an icare2 and some salt nic juice to lower the price longer term. \u000a\u000aAfter vaping for 2 years, salt nic is basically the same as other juices, just allows you to use lower watt devices and still get a satisfying nic feeling. Also helps be a bit more discreet than the fog machine vapes I had been using. 
p253
aVI'd recommend the suorin drop over the juul, you get to pick out of many more flavors and it's much higher quality
p254
aVHeres what I dont understand about the Sourin or JUUL\u000a\u000aThey both use extremely high nicotine content. 40 and 25mg? Wtf? I thought 12 was pretty high, wouldnt 40 make you nic sick in two hits or do those devices vape liquid at a slower rate?
p255
aVNic salt amounts &amp; freebase amounts are different. Salts generally are higher nic. \u000a\u000aI have a juul and I use it alongside a direct lung device that uses 3mg freebase nic juice in it. I only get sick if I go and hit the juul like 20 something times like an idiot. You can generally tell when to stop, the juul also is designed to only be hit a handful or so times rather than be chain vaped.
p256
aVSS316 0.6ohm / 1.5ohm Clapton / SV 0.5ohm Ceramic -- What's The Best MTL Coil for AIO Devices / MiOne?\u000a\u000aI'm using these in a Mi-One, although I assume the experience would be the same if using in an AIO device.\u000a\u000aI've been using the standard Joyetech .6ohm Coils as well as the SV brand .6ohm coils - they seem roughly the same, although I think I might get slightly better life out of the Joyetechs.\u000a\u000aI've been thinking about trying a different coil.  I see Smoking Vapor now offers .5ohm ceramic coils, but they are also $15 for 3 - a bit pricey.  They claim they last 3 times as long, but they don't really give any other info.  The Joyetech 1.5ohm Clapton also interests me, although I'm curious how the higher ohm load performs.\u000a\u000aI'm not really looking for a lung inhale of any kind - just mouth to lung.  Like a JUUL with a bit more power and a little more airflow.\u000a\u000aDoes anyone have any experience with these?
p257
aVI prefer coils above 1 ohm for mouth to lung.  You're not really getting anything out of SS if you don't use temp control.  I wouldn't touch any ceramic coils -- they can be dangerous.  \u000a\u000a&gt;Like a JUUL with a bit more power and a little more airflow.\u000a\u000aIt sounds like you'd benefit from a tank built for MtL.  In the meantime, check out the claptons and see if you enjoy them more. \u000a 
p258
aVAnyone used this "eon" device that's JUUL compatible and vice versa.\u000a\u000aIt's very... Odd.\u000a\u000aUsually you'd think a company would want pods SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR THEIR DEVICE.  So you HAVE to buy their pods.  But this is basically what I WANTED in a JUUL v2.0.  Their charger was so bad (I've had ZERO issues with the Bo charging, which is similar...but I have 3 juul chargers and 5 juul devices all broken.  *PAX DID replace everything so it was fine*\u000a\u000aI remember replying to an email with my blueprint for a better version...and it DEFINITELY included either micro USB or USB-C charging with a cable included.\u000a\u000aI took advantage of the sale they have going and got a kit... Just to test it out.\u000a\u000aI have a pack of cool mint JUUL pods (I've heard the eos pods aren't the best, so I'll probably just use cool mint pods in the eos device and not worry about the damn charger shitting out or pushing a contact in JUST enough so it wouldn't charge...)\u000a\u000aI noticed RubyRoo (who DEFINITELY gets kickbacks from PAX or free shit, no question) had her tips and tricks video and even my newest device doesn't have four large square contacts... They're all tiny circles.  And I always clean them.  But sometimes one will get pushed in by the charger somehow JUST enough so it won't charge again.  So this sounded perfect for someone who loves the juul but hates the quality of the device and method of charging.\u000a\u000aNice.\u000a\u000aNew device, no posts on it.  I make a post and it's downvoted to hell.  What does SMOK or some other fucking Chinese mod company that puts shit our all the time own the ecr mods now?\u000a\u000aMy question is VERY clear in the title.  **Does anybody have experience with this device?  If so, some input would be great.**
p259
aVPicked up two Sourin air v1 pods and one has a light burnt taste while the other hasn\u2019t a chemically taste\u000a\u000ai waited 30 minutes to prime the juice in the pod but no luck. Is it because it\u2019s a v1 pod and not a v2 pod? My first sourin pod was great but this ian making me think about going back to juul and it\u2019s bad pods :(
p260
aVDevice most similar to actual cigs?\u000a\u000aSo i am looking to quit smoking for quit, i currently vape every now and again with an aspire mega kit however it rarely feels like the real thing and i find myself buying cigarettes. Is there any device or mod that actuall feels like a cig? I was looking at the JUUL however it is not available here in the UK. Something that charges fast, lasts a decent time, can be used with regular e liquids and is an all round great device, thanks guys 
p261
aVDon't ever buy directly from the manufacturers when it comes to Chinese vape products, it is known. I recommend a site like Vapecrawler which is basically Google for vape sites. U type what u want and they give you a list of every site selling it and how much they charge, as well as any coupon codes they have running. The sites I buy gear from mostly are eightvape, Breazy, Element Vape and FastTech when I don't mind waiting. Steer clear of dealing directly with any vape manufacturers unless you have to in the case of something like the Juul where it's not sold on vape sites. Also you'll usually pay a LOT more when dealing directly than u would on a vape site. For example, the Alien kit was like $100 on Smok's website but it's $50-60 anywhere else
p262
aVWell cigarettes surely gave you some good "feeling", didn't it? And that's already a thing. The big state University in my state has started to use the "juul" ecig to get buzzed during class due to it being so high nic content. My cousin goes there and they literally just sit in the back and take stealth hits to get through the Lecture (I go to a private University where this wouldn't be a thing). And ya I'm too young to legally drink but I never mentioned alcohol.
p263
aVHonestly, I don\u2019t know. I think it is, but my own data is skewed. I\u2019ve had 3 JUUL\u2019s. 2 work, one stopped. But I use them a lot more than my one Air. It still works, but I don\u2019t use it as often. \u000a\u000aI\u2019m guessing \u201cyes\u201d, but the price of the Air might make it worth grabbing a backup and sticking with it unless you get dinged by failure too quickly. \u000a\u000a
p264
aVLooking for a small box mod kit\u000a\u000aI\u2019m on the juul right now since my Smok alien kit broke, and I\u2019m looking for a vape kit that\u2019s relatively small in the hand. Don\u2019t really care about high wattages or customization, just need something small, reliable and not one of those shaft kits.\u000a\u000a\u000alooking at the SV MVAPE MI ONE ULTRA PORTABLE KIT - any reviews?
p265
aVLooking to get Suorin Air (coming from a Juul), does the liquid matter?\u000a\u000aWhere I live (Tulsa), doesn't predominately carry nic salt juice, so Ill have to order online.  But to start when I go in to the store, does it matter if I get nicotine salts for my Air? They are sold out of Drops.\u000a\u000aAlso, can I hit the Air while I am charging?\u000a\u000aAnything else I should know?\u000a\u000a
p266
aVBlu vs. juul vs. another small form ecig advice needed\u000a\u000aSo like I'm kinda a poor college student, and I need the most cost efficient small cigarette size ecig there is. I have a mod but I can't be walking around with a hug mod like that. I've had a disposable Blu and I went through it in a week. It tasted pretty bad halfway through. I've heard good things about juuls, but they just seem super expensive a Blu tank goes for 400 puffs, and a juul pod goes for 200. Where should I go and why?
p267
aVPerhaps an AIO or Pod device would suite you well. Something like an Aspire Breeze, iCare 2, Boulder Rock, Limitless Pulse, etc paired with some nic salt juice would be much cheaper than a closed Pod device like the Juul. 
p268
aVMy favorite Pod Mod is the [Limitless Pulse](http://www.vapecrawler.com/results/limitless%20pulse) as it has excellent flavor and good vapor and the draw is the closest to a cig (it's a draw fire, like Juul) to me also it feels great between your fingers at [Ecig-City it's $25](https://ecig-city.com/collections/cigalikes/products/pulse-pod-system-by-limitless-mod-co-2ml-refillable-cigalike-device) and [replacement pods](https://ecig-city.com/products/limitless-pulse-replacement-pods-3-pack) are 3 for $9.99\u000a\u000aThe [Boulder Rock](https://www.electrictobacconist.com/boulder-rock-vape-pen-kit-p1294) great vapor and good flavor and it's only $10 also has a fire button\u000a\u000aI highly recommend both
p269
aVIf you're trying to save money, I would not go with a juul. I've gone through a pod in a day and it starts to add up. I recently just bought a Suorin Drop and I am liking it very much. It has refillable pods so you can get juice that you enjoy the most (recommend going with nic salt based juice). Bought mine for $35 and after refilling the pods around 5 times they get bad so you'll need to pick new ones up. I think you can get them online for $3 a piece or a shop near me sells the pods for $5 a piece. Overall, would recommend over the juul. The drop is also very discrete you can hide it easily in your hand when you hit it.
p270
aVI tried a free one a year or so ago, among the worst juices I ever tasted was their rendition of tobacco. You hear the phrase licking an ashtray used before, this literally tasted like what I imagine it would be like. Even if it tasted good, it was still a shitty device. Basically a joye 510 (we're going back in time now) with a few changes and proprietary cartridges or whatever the hell you'd call them. It's old technology, that gives you a terrible experience overall. \u000a\u000aLike most big tobacco owned e-cigs (Mark Ten, Blu) they're I assume, still outdated, terrible flavor options, over priced, and almost pointless to use versus a pod system (Juul, Phix, Bo, Myjet, Dolphin, Penguin, the list goes on).
p271
aVThere's no shame in that, in fact I tried a few cigalikes myself in the early days. I think they changed since I had the one I was referring to since then, but there are still better alternatives I feel. That being said, if it keeps you from smoking or even smoking less, then who am I to judge? \u000a\u000aIt's also intimidating at first having to learn the technical jargon and finding something that works for you I feel, so you are not alone in that by any means. If your husband doesn't mind, maybe ask what he's using and to show you the ropes, if you don't want to go that route, there's things like the Juul (not the cheapest option out there I will warn you) and other "pod" systems (think like a cartridge you just pop in and out of a stick (the battery basically) and there's almost not much at all to learn with some of them. \u000a\u000aI have only tried the Juul so far, and yes pod prices can be more than I like to spend on liquid, but the warranty is fantastic and it kept me from giving into some recent cigarette cravings after months of not having smoked a single one. \u000a\u000aI heard good things about [this](http://www.bombies.com/starterkit-ns-bombies) and it's a great deal, so much so that I may get one myself soon when I get the extra cash. It's simple, refillable and you can order empty pods online (some shops may carry them, I am unfamiliar with the shop scene these days) which you can refill with juice like the bottle that comes with that combo kit they offer. There's a ton of other pod systems that will probably be mentioned also, my best advice is spend some time looking up user experiences, some youtube videos and other information and decide what would be best for you. \u000a\u000aIf you want a more advanced setup than that, there's a few things to keep in mind like the do's and don'ts of external batteries (with a little googlefu it's basically common sense shit), tanks with coils you screw in and change out as they wear out and a wide array of options out there. \u000a\u000aI would say start simple and if you want to, work your way up to something more advanced. And if not, that's fine too. I have a friend who uses the same setup she started with from day one and has no desire to use anything else if she doesn't have to. Personally I am into it on a hobbyist level and I like buying fancy things when I can, but I'm by no means better than her for owning more expensive and advanced setups. \u000a\u000aIn a way, I kind of envy her and wish I wasn't always looking for the next latest and greatest thing, she's saving a ton of money comparatively.\u000a\u000aLastly, I apologize if I came off rude, I just had a memorably bad time with that one Blu kit and it brought back some memories of a less than enjoyable experience. Congratulations also on quitting in November, it took me a few months to stop dual using and I had a few slip ups, so I'd say you're on the right path, and hats off to being able to do so with a cigalike like the Blu, I had to try several setups before finally finding the one that would do it for me. Keep up the good work.
p272
aVskip blu, get a juul.
p273
aVRefillable Juul like vape\u000a\u000aIm fairly new to vaping, 7 days off cigarretes.\u000aIve currently got a voopoo mod and loving it. However im after something like a Juul that isnt a pod system, just refillable. Something that I can vape in public that gives the same amount of vapour as a cigarrette. Taste is a must, as is minimal clouds.\u000aIs there a tank I can add to the voopoo to achieve this?
p274
aV&gt; As I dont want to have seperate juice just for a MTL.\u000a\u000aKeep in mind you will go through juice far slower with the Nautilus and MTL than you will a TFV12. I was worried about the same once I recently started getting more into MTL myself, and I find my juice consumption on the setups I use for that is far less than any of my direct lung setups. \u000a\u000aI would say try anywhere between 6-12mg and see what you like. I normally direct lung 3mg, but mtl between 9-12mg, excluding the Juul which is a different case in itself juice wise. 
p275
aVPretty rampant in the schools around here, although most of them are using 0nic juice and some really terrible ego pens. Although devices like juul are also very popular as well. 
p276
aVThe transition period is far from a fun time, but at least for me it was about two weeks before I found myself craving my vape setups and ended up giving my leftover cigarettes away. \u000a\u000aJust have to be determined to push through that period, easier said than done of course, but very rewarding in the end in overall enjoyment, cost and last but not least the obvious health benefits. \u000a\u000aAnother thing to consider is that like any addiction, it's not uncommon to fall off the wagon during tough times or for whatever reason it may be, the key is to know you can always stop and try again. Of course, you shouldn't use this as an excuse or justification to begin whatever habit it was again, but it's almost a fact at this point (at least IMO) that regarding addictions this is a factor that I see often neglected to be mentioned here.\u000a\u000aI think it took me two or three tries before it finally worked for me. I still sometimes will have fleeting cravings for one, but then I remember how much I dislike the taste now (it's funny how mental associations switch like that) and the other negatives regarding smoking and I just stick it out. I think it's 15 minutes or less for the average craving to last with substances, so it's not the hardest thing to endure, and I have a high % nic salt pod system setup (Juul) as well, partially to help get through those times. The Juul may not be the cheapest option out there, but it serves its purpose for me, and does so with flying colors.
p277
aVKids love that Juul vape.  
p278
aVA friend of mine at work has been telling me that his middle school kids have been seeing Juul's being passed around at football games and such.  I did warn him of the very high nic salt content in a Juul and that it's probably not something a bunch of 14 year olds need to be doing. I vape nic salts as a former smoker of 32 years and I know how easy it is to over do it and get a horrible nic headache so I did tell him to talk to his kids about not hitting those high nicotine devices. It's not cool to throw up all over your friends and make yourself sick.  JMO. \u000a
p279
aVYeah, I quit with a Juul and I liked it for what it was....it's also expensive AF! I wish these asshole gas statons would stop selling them to 13 year olds. It's going to make nic salts harder for people my age to get. \u000a
p280
aVI feel like it's become an epidemic. I go to a public school in a good neighborhood and you can find somebody vaping in every bathroom of the school during the passing periods. I've heard schools in lower end neighborhoods have it worse, but I've heard about the same things happening at private schools as well. During finals week there were 15 kids in one bathroom just vaping and hanging out. The school sends out emails about vaping every week. Seems like everyone at the school bought a juul or a phix because they thought it was cool and then got addicted to nicotine.
p281
aVPod systems are probably the smallest, I personally love my juul and the weight and size of it, but it's seemingly a love it or hate it device based on the price of pods and sadly, some of the subculture surrounding it. There's a bunch out there, refillable and closed that would be worth researching into and seeing what you like the best out of whats available. \u000a\u000aI will say high nicotine content nic salt juice is no joke, sometimes just a handful of hits off my juul keeps me satisfied as much or sometimes moreso than much, much more off of my 12mg freebase juice I use in my other mtl setup. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's subjective. It does have its benefits though, and there's also lower level nic salt juice out there than the 50mg that is in the Juul pods. 50mg sounds astronomical, but being nic salts and the way the whole setup works, it's actually smoother than my 12mg freebase nic setup. Packs a punch though, especially if you never had salts before, especially at that concentration.
p282
aVNot cheap but the juul is my favorite stealth MTL vape. I'll buy a pack of pods and when they're empty i'll refill them a couple times.
p283
aVyup, first day off my juul I took 2 hits and was actually buzzed. 
p284
aVUsually I use a JUUL but I've been partial to the [Suorin Air](http://www.infinitevapor.com/The-Suorin-Air_p_404.html) lately. Perfect stealth vape since it's smaller than my drivers license and the flavor is surprisingly good.
p285
aVAre there any decent coffee flavor nic salts?\u000a\u000aHi all, I hope this is the correct place to post this!\u000a\u000aIn an effort to quit cigarettes I picked up a box mod vape a few months back. I enjoyed playing with the clouds for a while but I soon realized that it didn't do much for my nicotine cravings. Then I started using my girlfriend's Juul and I loved it. However, the pods were expensive, and I wanted to get something like the Juul for myself. I ended up picked up a Sourin Drop a few days ago and I really like it. It gives me a nice throat hit, and due to the high nicotine levels I really don't feel like smoking cigarettes anymore (yay!). \u000a\u000a\u000aWhen I was using the Juul I really liked the mint and creme brulee flavors. The creme brulee really just tasted like coffee to me and I loved it. I've been searching online trying to find a good coffee flavored nic salt with around 50 mg levels but it seems like most flavors are custards and various fruits. I got the Mr. Salt-E strawberry custard flavor as it was the only non-fruit flavor they had in the store and its OK, but doesn't really satisfy my cravings for a good coffee flavor.\u000a\u000aDoes anybody know of any reputable companies that produce a flavor that tastes like the Juul's creme brulee flavor? Or something like a sweet coffee flavor?
p286
aVJuul is lighting up but not hitting?\u000a\u000aSo I have a juul that is lighting up but not hitting. The juice will get in my mouth, but it will not pull. I've taken the battery out and cleaned it put it back in and it still does the same thing? I dont know what to do?
p287
aVThey make the Juul
p288
aVThat's assuming he registered it for the warranty and is of age. No post history and not knowing that Pax is the parent company I guess of Juul makes me wonder..
p289
aVMy SXmini with a Kayfun Prime. Crushes my various thousands of dollars worth of other gear. \u000a\u000aJUUL with a Cool Mint pod for stealth. \u000a\u000aAs you can tell I\u2019m more of a MTL guy but when I\u2019m home and feel like being a dragon to the tikes I\u2019ll pull out my OG King Mod with a Dead Rabbit and fill up the living room in no time!
p290
aVJUUL! Quick, Easy, Discrete, Fun, and Nicotine!
p291
aVJuul for ease of use and portability.
p292
aVI've been running a kbox 200 for a while and it's been a solid mod. I just lost it though :(\u000a\u000aProbably gonna switch over to something in a juul form factor or get another kbox and try the new uwell crown tank. The first was my favorite when it wasn't leaking. 
p293
aVYou\u2019ll get some good advice here but I do know that it depends on the mod you use and other variables that are preference based. Low wattage devices tend to make less vapor which makes higher nic juices a better choice. Nicotine in salt form is smoother and faster acting at higher levels than basic nicotine. And preferred method of inhalation mouth to lung (MTL) mimics smoking sensation and also produces a bit more of a cigarette feel than direct to lung (DTL) which produces cloud like vapor (usually with a sub ohm tank) and can be difficult for New vapers/ex smokers. \u000a\u000aThere\u2019s a bit of a learning curve but there\u2019s ways to make it more convenient at an entry level. Premade juice, stock coils, internal battery device, etc. \u000a\u000aSomeone more versed in devices than I can possibly give better entry recommendations.  But I will say, a smoker who isn\u2019t ready to transition might never try it but it wouldn\u2019t hurt for you to give them the chance. \u000a\u000aBest of luck!\u000a\u000aEdit: general rule is 3 or 6mg max for sub ohm tanks, 6-12mg is usually sufficient for most daily vapers with lower wattage pen style devices but people do go as high as 50mg (salt nic) with pods such as juul. 
p294
aVHmm. I don\u2019t want a JUUL because I want to use my own juice. What MTL pod device would you recommend? 
p295
aVOk because the main reason I want to switch is I\u2019m not getting enough of a kick from 6mg subohm anymore, but 12mg destroys my throat. after trying a buddy\u2019s juul I wanted a device meant for MTL because I already MTL my subohm tank. Thanks for your help though, definitely appreciate it because I probably would\u2019ve gotten a Suorin
p296
aVSuorins are fine but they're finicky. I'm just gonna switch to a juul soon 
p297
aVEsquare DNA40 vs DNA60 for a noob?\u000a\u000aI\u2019m pretty new to vaping, and my objectives are mostly quality, aesthetics, and flavor(in fact, if my clouds weren\u2019t huge I\u2019d be fine with it). I\u2019m used to the Juul and it\u2019s flavor, but I\u2019m so sick of refilling pods. I saw a DNA40 mod for like $35, is it worth spending double for the DNA60 if all I care about is flavor?
p298
aVI mean, you can get a DNA 250 on Fasttech for like $55.\u000a\u000aThe thing about a DNA40 mod is that even on something like a Supertank Mini, which is a pretty commonly recommended flavor tank, you're going to be running at or near the full 40 watts all the time, and that's hard on the batteries and the board.\u000a\u000aEdit: how committed to the DNA are you? Not knocking DNA board quality, but it may also be overkill for someone just coming off a juul.\u000a\u000aSomething like [this](https://www.elementvape.com/vaporesso-tarot-nano-80w-tc-starter-kit) gives you plenty of power, onboard battery, and a tank, and is a solid device.
p299
aVMy favorite moment would have to be getting my buddy who has smoked for 15 years finally off the cigs and on to a juul. May not be much but it was a great start! I think I have made it on the nice list for once!
p300
aVI gave my sister a Juul for Christmas yesterday. She opened it up and I set it up for her and explained it all and she took a hit and was shocked at how it felt. By the end of the night she was confident that she could use it to replace cigarettes. Also my grandma was not amused that my sister was ripping on the Juul in the house. (I since explained to my sister that vaping is generally considered acceptable in the same places as smoking, if you wouldn\u2019t smoke there don\u2019t vape there - unless it\u2019s your own home). Good stuff. 
p301
aVRemember That Everyone On This god forsaken forum hates anyone who wants to ask them instead of googling it themselves. If you're looking for an amazing cigalike look at the phix by mlv, the juul from pax labs, or the warlock p2 by rof. Good luck with the karma my guy!!
p302
aVIt might just be a bot downvoting you :) Give it time to balance out.\u000a\u000aFWIW I've gone from buying authentic mechs and expensive stuff (like ordering RDAs directly from a small machinist in Greece, and things like my authentic brass Kraken are just collecting dust) to a Subtank/Subox to a Cupti to currently an AL85. From Five Pawns to DIY.  I've found that after 4 years I'm over the collecting and cloud-chasing. Being a simple vaper is certainly cheaper. :D\u000a\u000aHave you looked into the Juul or Bo Vape? Bigger than a cigalike but they seem to be popular and the pods are refillable to some degree.\u000a\u000a
p303
aVyeah I was trying to consider a Juul but they seem pricier than the icare\u000a
p304
aVThe juul pods last longer than the cig alike pods. The aspire breeze might also work. 
p305
aVI love my Juul, but they are still expensive. What about the Aspire Breeze or better yet the Pockex. They're bigger but they do the trick and are both pretty satisfying vapes. 
p306
aVSo, have you heard of Ohman Mods? Made the Uno for the Billet Box, Pancake Dripper rda, bunch of stuff. Anyway, he's currently making a batch of his Dripsticks, a 14500 16mm hybrid mech, titanium, with rda, meant for salts/high nic. I haven't received the one I ordered yet, but god damn am I looking forward to a Juul sized mech/dripper, it looks badass
p307
aVThe Juul and Phix are well regarded in this current day and age. Neither are technically refillable, I know it's possible on the Juul, I haven't tried. \u000a\u000aThe pods could be cheaper that's for sure, but the great warranty they offer is why I chose it as my first pod system. I'm still researching refillable pod systems that are as close to the Juul as I can get in terms of size, weight and if possible customer service, so I can't really speak much on those. \u000a\u000a
p308
aVBo isn\u2019t TC so it gets dry burns rather easily. Juul is far better in that regard. 
p309
aVAlright I\u2019m on there but don\u2019t see any posts related to what you\u2019re talking about... maybe a photo from 2014 that looks Juul size 
p310
aVSorry I just did a quick search in the group, looks like the list closed at the end of November. It is the same size as a Juul, just 14500 mech tube, and he has redone the design from 2014. I guess your best bet would be a PM to Bret, or wait until someone decides to sell theirs once they start arriving 
p311
aVjuul or suorin air
p312
aVI was JUST watching a video on the Laan. Looks very well made AND it's available in Canada at my local shop.  VERY pricy compared to the Von ERL and Limitless but I am will to pay for a good device.\u000a\u000aLet me know how it is compared to the Von ERL please.\u000a\u000aJuul is not available in Canada.
p313
aVEither of the eleaf icares. I have both and they are very good and cheap. I also just bought kandypens rubi. Closest thing to a juul but you can fill the pods with your own juice. 
p314
aVPlease let me know how this is! I just bought a Suorin Drop and have found that it hits great with good flavor but after a couple refills of the pod I have been getting a burnt taste. I have around 5-6 replacement pods and with 2 left have been slowly realizing that I have not yet found the Juul-replacement I was looking for.\u000a\u000aThe Dolphin looks sweet and is in the same price range. Would really like to be satisfied with the product of choice so I'd really appreciate hearing your feedback after a couple of days!!
p315
aVSo refreshing to hear this kind of insight! \u000a\u000aI feared as much but it\u2019s indeed comforting to hear someone else confirm my beliefs. Makes me a bit more content on rebuying pods for my drop as that\u2019s the cheapest option and just waiting for the true \u201cJuul killer\u201d. \u000a\u000aI\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re enjoying your Dolphin. Sounds like some innovative tech that\u2019s going towards the right direction. I\u2019m definitely going to pick one up now for whenever I want a more consistent vaping experience than my Drop but I probably won\u2019t be taking it around as much, I just hate the aesthetics lol.\u000a\u000aI really appreciate this man, hopefully we\u2019ll be able to find the perfect product to talk about!! 
p316
aVJuul.  I went through the steps.  Juul is the best. 
p317
aVCan't get a juul in the UK, or at least not without ordering it from the US and hoping you don't get customs taxes or issues, even then your stuck for pods as we get a 20mg/ml cap on everything 
p318
aVI am 4 day\u2019s cigarette free and have been using a Ghost.  It is basically a Juul but you can buy empty pods.  I have been using Mr. Salt E\u2019s high nicotine juice but I think I\u2019m going to switch to the CRFT brand since I don\u2019t really like the taste of the two flavors I have tried.  Honestly though, I have been snusing some since snus satisfies me much more than vaping does.
p319
aVHonestly if you can the juul is a great alternative at first. 
p320
aVThat sucks. I like a lot of mods and juices but once I started using Juul it changed the game for me by a lot. The tabbacco flavor hits and like a cigarette and the flavor is damn good.\u000aIf you can't get it in the UK i would look at other nicotine salt options. Maybe mix your own if there is a cap on nicotine levels.  \u000aOther than that I would say just experiment.  \u000aI tried many devices before I found what I liked.  \u000aStarted with blue e cigs. Went on to vape pens. Got a low watt box mod. Then a high watt mod. Finally ended on my Juul.  \u000aAs for flavors start with what you would like.  \u000aNothing is 100 percent like a cigarette. Price is not really a good indication of quality. Wait for sales then mix it up some. Most vape companys I have tried had one or two that were really good and a few that were misses for me but hits for others. Its all about preference. The worst flavors I have ever bought came from my own local vape shops unique in store mixes.  \u000aBuy online. I dont know about in the UK but the shops here jack up the prices and have weak sales if any on mods at all and they charge full to over price for juice brands.  Not even close to a competition.  \u000aWould make some recommendations but you are in the uk so I dont know how helpful they would be.  \u000aGood luck and have fun
p321
aVI'm not the op but this is a great answer\u000a\u000aI went the diy route but would try a juul if not for the shipping costs of it +refills, but I am debating ordering some nicotine salt base from the US soon to get something similar at a reasonable cost\u000a\u000aJust hard to pull the trigger at 30+ for the shipping when I have a huge stock of normal nic base in the freezer 
p322
aVWhat's your "Best of 2017"?\u000a\u000aAfter giving it some thought mine are:\u000a\u000aMod: Voopoo Drag. Just an all around fantastic mod with an awesome chip.\u000a\u000aSubohm tank: Crown 3.

aVThe company that has impressed me the most is Sigelei.  Their customer service from a store's perpsective has been fantastic.  Even when things are out of range of our vendor's RMA process, they have replaced defective mods.  Great stuff.\u000a\u000aSmoant's Battlestar has been great for us as a super reliable, but still inexpensive mod.  \u000a\u000aThe Recoil Rebel is my favorite RDA of the year, with an easy to build deck, great airflow no matter which top cap you use, and the ultem ring that helps me with my consistent overdripping.\u000a\u000aThe Freemax Fireluke is hands down the best subtank I have used this year, with coil heads that just seem to last, and a build deck that made me give up on all my other rebuildable tanks.\u000a\u000aInnokin's T20S has been the best starter kit of the year in my opinion.  Great performance, low price, wonderful packaging.  The T20 is a great runner up.\u000a\u000aThe Baton pod system is the store favorite this year.  It's a simple little button-activated pod system that is styled much like the Juul, but the pods are made to be refillable.  The eliquid is made in Washington State, and tastes pretty dang good.  I rarely use mine anymore, but when I did it was very satisfying.\u000a\u000aStill my favorite DTL starter kit is the Eleaf iJust S.  Uses the ubiquitous Eleaf EC coil heads, has a 3000mah battery, and is overall a pretty solid, and great performing unit.\u000a\u000aAs for eliquid, I've been solidly impressed with Cloud Alchemist's liquids, and their Glacialis Menta has sold super well in our shop.  Cloud Nine from Oregon has always been big for us, but I'm still stuck on their Oregon Blackberry.  Oregon 33 makes another store favorite called Rogue.  Another new addition to our lineup at the store is the Aqua line, which has also been a big hit.\u000a\u000aAs for reviewers, I find myself watching GrimmGreen and Ruby Roo quite a bit, mostly because I like their personalities.  For pure information I watch DJLSB. 
p325
aV&gt;Anyone had any luck besides buying another one?\u000a\u000aNope. But I ain't mad. It's $20 china device. Any more and I might be salty over it, but a pack of JUUL pods costs about the same.
p326
aVJuul or iCare. You can\u2019t fix an auto firing Sourin as the multitude of other posts on here about the same issue have already dealt with this issue.
p327
aVI'm not salty either, man. Like you said, it's 20 bucks. I'm used to these salt-nic mods dying pretty quick, I just hoped for more than a month out of it since the others I've had last me at least a few. I guess it's time to go Juul, I've just been trying to avoid that since it's the priciest and most wasteful of them all.
p328
aVTo be fair, I've had JUULs shit out on me in a similar timefreame. They'll replace them, but they don't make it easy and it takes a fucking while. And 50mg is just too much for me anymore. I'm doing 25mg salts in the air.
p329
aVNoted, and thank you. I'm sure anything I buy has that chance, of course. I just feel like people who've had a Juul have had better experiences. 
p330
aVIf it was possible to fix the autofiring and it probably is, it'd cost you more for the repair than it did for the device.. , sorry bro\u000a\u000aOthers have already mentioned aspire. Breeze, i care, juul. I've had the icare and breeze. The breeze liked to give a little spitback but fiddling with the coil s wicking port tended to fix. I care was great all-around.
p331
aVHey thanks man! I mostly was concerned that it was going to crap out on me fairly soon due to reading reviews on them, so I wanted to find something that has a better rep and is compatible with my battery and Smok tank, do you have any advice for finding honest reviews? I\u2019ll def check out those joyetech coils btw. I still have some e-salt from when I was refilling my Juul and Von Erl(spits like crazy!) and it\u2019s working well for me.
p332
aVTl;dr - get nic salt juice in 12mg 6mg and 3mg. Get something mouth to lung preferably with an internal battery. Juul is $$$ but also easy and discreet. \u000a\u000aThere are some good suggestions here already. Definitely think success for a smoker switching over to vape is dependent on getting a few variables right, compared to how willing the person is to deal. For example: if she is desperate to quit, she\u2019ll vape through a juice even if she doesn\u2019t like the flavor. Some people won\u2019t vape a flavor they don\u2019t like at all. I\u2019d suggest getting something that is 12mg and 6mg so she can see the difference in hit (how harsh on the mouth/throat) as compared to how much nic it provides. I find new vapers not willing to hit vape over and over until they get their fix so going higher mg can help with making that transition. \u000a\u000aThat said, I found having some 0mg flavorless helped me at first too to cut down the strength so I could see how it affected me. Vaping nic is different than puffing. Smoking will hit you and remove cravings in seconds. Vaping takes a bit longer. For that, I\u2019d recommend for sure getting the salt version of the juice being bought. It\u2019s smoother at higher levels than regular and gives a bit more rush like a real cigarette. \u000a\u000aAdditionally , I find mouth to lung (mtl) style vapes are more natural for smokers in transition. Box style mods with external batteries are the best for price (eventually to save money people build their own coils for pennies to the dollar) and battery length. That\u2019s said, internal batteries are way easier and much more discreet vapes, if less satisfying to some degree (less vapor production = less nic on any given pull). Given that you may get a bit less vape this supports my opinion that going higher nic with an option for lower is good. Also the smaller ones can be easier to fill with often a bit cheaper coils. For some reason people will be shocked at buying a $5 coil but will spend $15 on a pack of Marlboro lights they can run through in two hours on a night out. \u000a\u000aLastly, I can\u2019t stand the juul but it\u2019s everywhere, it\u2019s easy to use, and it\u2019s small/discreet, and has loads of nic. A quick pull on that can deliver a good dose of nic while she figures out the rest. I think it\u2019s important to remember the goal is to quit and it\u2019s ok to buy something and not completely use it. Or not use it forever. Still cheaper than smoking and definitely way better for you. Lots of bumps in the road to quitting but we all get there. 
p333
aVI just tried Blvk Unicorn FRZNCHEE (frozen lychee) and it tasted really awesome, very lychee-like. It's a pity I was only able to find the 35mg one, as I'd imagine the 50 would maybe hit more menthol like? (I'm not sure though, as I don't think I'm very informed)\u000a\u000aI just got the Drop and I've tried a fair amount of juices since. It's a bit hit or miss for me though, some juices definitely seem to even pull differently and I've already got a bunch of cartridges to try various flavors. \u000a\u000aFor instance, NKD Brain Freeze and Frost Bite both hit really strong, with strong menthol taste (I greatly prefer Brain Freeze), and the tobacco flavor is not bad too. On the other hand, I hit the Hi-Nic Cereal and it took a lot more to draw and the smoke just tasted less flavorful (maybe it was the cereal?)\u000a\u000aI wish there were consistent answers but it seems like nic-salts are a relatively new domain, and just coming off of the Juul myself I figure it's the best option for my budget, but having a little reluctance with the unpredictability. I especially don't like filling up a cartridge (waiting a couple mins, which is fine), but only to find that the juice doesn't hit as nicely as I would've wanted!\u000a\u000a
p334
aVIndeed. I still go to r/juul for some comedy though 
p335
aVDepends on how strong you're vaping or style. Mtl vapers who want sth like 18mg or higher, or those who use those juul pod type devices will definitely want nic salts, as normal nic will get very harsh at that level. If it's just at 3 or 6mg, regular nic is fine. 
p336
aVthank you.  I got my Air YESTERDAY.  Waited 10 minutes, but every hit has been super like.. hot on my mouth? and SO harsh, like nasty.  The coil isnt burnt but I guess enough juice wasnt getting to the cotton/coil.  And the air side of the pod is extremely filled up with condensation, is that normal?  I blew into the fill hole and it pushed a bunch of juice into the cotton/mouth side.  It seems to be tasting a little better, just hoping I didnt hurt the coil/pod.\u000a\u000aAny suggestions for this new device? I am coming from the juul, which i LOVE.  I am looking to get some nicotine salts for the Air.
p337
aVA: the mouth piece of the air (and the drop) does get quite warm during normal use, especially if you are chain hitting it. this is probably adding to the feeling of getting super dry, harsh hits. you probably aren't burning your coil.\u000a\u000aB: the air side of the pod isn't covered in condensation, its actually just small droplets of e-liquid which have spattered out a little bit. you don't normally notice this on other vapes because the area around the coil isn't transparent.\u000a\u000aC:Blow into the fill hole more if you aren't getting the flavor you want, worst you are gonna do to your pod is push liquid too far,at which point you might suck some liquid into your mouth. Blowing into the fill port isn't just for when you prime the coil, but for whenever you get dry hits.\u000a\u000aD: Nicotine salts are the way to go with devices like this. and if you have a bunch of used juul pods laying around, you can refill those up with the juice too, and use the juul as a backup device. just be careful with the nic salts, as the air hits harder than the juul.\u000a\u000aE: Suggestions: be vigilant about preventing dry hits, buying new pods because you burnt your current ones sucks. Depending on your juice, and how good you are at preventing dry hits, you can get more then the 5 refills that the company recommends. be vigilant about the air continuing to hit even after you have stopped pulling; since you aren't inhaling and pulling juice into the wick, the wick can easily run dry and burn.either pull the pod out of the device, or hit the on/off switch. Carry a napkin or two on you, depending on where you keep your air(pocket, jacket, wallet, purse) the air pods leak a tiny bit the more you use them, but the leak occurs between the metal casing and the outer surface of the pod, and the surface tension of the e-liquid keeps the leak contained.The leak is very minor, but its something to be wary of. Another minor cosmetic thing, the glossy plastic of the pod scratches very very easily, so if you care about the aesthetics of your air, carry it in a different pocket than your keys, coins, e.t.c.\u000a\u000aF: Juice! I suggest Mr.Salt-e's watermelon flavor, and I've tried the non nic-salt version of Naked's Brain freeze, which is my favorite flavor of all time.\u000a\u000aSorry for the essay, I'm on break with time to burn and I like being thorough. Happy New Years and Happy vaping!

aVJUUL draws fine, but light no longer turns on\u000a\u000aAfter cleaning my JUUL prongs and battery the first time, the light stopped turning on. At first my friend said that I put the battery in backwards, but I cleaned it again a couple days ago and put it in the correct way and the light still doesn\u2019t turn on. \u000a\u000aI can still draw from it and he airflow is fine, it\u2019s just that the light no longer works so I never know when the batter is low or I need to charge it. Any tips or fixes for this?
p339
aVI have the Mi-Pod and I love it. Perfect little on the go type vape. I'd also recommend the Juul, even though not refillable. I haven't used one but people seem to like that as well.
p340
aVWith a bit of patience (like 5 minutes for a pod refill) you can refill a Juul pod 2 or 3 times.  \u000a  \u000aPeople that have had no luck doing this usually forget to take out the cotton under the mouthpiece and dry it. Leaving it soaking with the previous pod's juices just makes it spit back and draw bad.  \u000a  \u000a  \u000aHow is your Mi-Pod I was looking into it because I want a Juul again...  \u000a  \u000aSome reviews were talking about leaking pods?  \u000a  \u000aDo you use Mr. Salt-E or some other nic salt juice, and if so what strength/brand?
p341
aVoof, a bit late.  \u000ai found a limited edition juul in a kind of local shop (15 miles away)  \u000aif i ever tire of the juul i'll probably re-look into the mi-pod again.  \u000ai appreciate the reply :)
p342
aVA pod system. There's open (refillable) and closed systems, but even one like the Juul (closed, not the cheapest pods in the world either) is cheaper than smoking, healthier, discrete and satisfying.
p343
aVMi-pod is very loose draw, so it might be effective in achieving the cig feel. I\u2019d recommend something like the Juul or Phix personally. The SMPO kit has the closest throat hit to a cig and the nic hits you like a truck.  I\u2019d definitely get a small cigalike with nic salts to help you quit cigs. 
p344
aVLooking for some Help\u000a\u000aI just got paid, and I'm tired of being back to smoking cigs...  \u000aI really wanted a Juul again, I planned on refilling like I had in the past, alas no store I went to today had em. Then I find out there was a limited blue one, which dissuaded me more.  \u000a  \u000aMy current vape device is a Smok Stick V8 with the Big Baby Beast.  \u000aIt kinda sucks, coils are hit and miss, but it's small and simple.  \u000a  \u000aI've enjoyed it for the year I've owned it, but it's obviously not working out anymore now that I'm smoking again.  \u000a  \u000aJust looking for a new device or be convinced to go back to Juul.  \u000a   \u000aAlso I tried an eleaf iCare 2 or w/e for nic salt, that thing was horrible and I did not like it.   \u000a  \u000aWent around after work today looking for a Juul. Found one 10 miles away, they only had the blue in stock (what!?).   \u000a  \u000aThe guy tells me they're the only ones in SC with em on the shelf.  \u000a  \u000a70 bucks for just the Juul.  \u000a103 after tax for the blue Juul and mango pods... :/
p345
aVIf the Juul keeps you off the fags go with the Juul. That's the crux of all this shit IMO.
p346
aVDo you prefer the style of inhale on the juul or the Smok stick? They're very different devices.
p347
aVIf you want to use whatever juice you want there are a bunch of cigalike pods vapes that you can get refillable pods for like the limitless pulse\u000a\u000aThe bo functions the same as a juul with the one and done pods
p348
aVI'm weird I like both large clouds DTL, and the heavy nic of the Juul in tiny MTL puffs.  \u000a  \u000aIt's all about how much I get out of how little work I put in.  \u000a  \u000aJuul refilling is a bit more work than changing a coil once a week (if that's even possible anymore)
p349
aVThe Bo is only 10 bucks cheaper than the Juul, and comes with 2 pods instead of 4.  \u000a  \u000aHave you used this? I Have some questions if you have...
p350
aVjuul or suorin

aVCould vaping too much be causing stomach issues?\u000a\u000aHello all,\u000aI\u2019ve been vaping for probably like 6 months or so after I quit cigarettes. I\u2019ve been using a pulse which is similar to a Juul except I can refill my own pods for substantially less money. However, in the last week or so I\u2019ve had heartburn and my stomach has just been achey. The juice is 50mg and I usually go through a pod a day(~2mL of juice). I was wondering if this could cause my stomach issues?\u000a\u000aI\u2019m just heavily addicted to nicotine again at this point, so maybe whenever I buy juice again I should go down to 30mg nicotine and then keep lowering it from there? Does anyone have experience regarding stomach issues and vaping? I don\u2019t think I\u2019m exhibiting symptoms of nicotine OD and I don\u2019t even get a buzz from it anymore, so does anyone have some insight for me?\u000a\u000aThanks!
p352
aVYes it can!! In 2013 when is started vaping i developed severe stomach pains which ulitimaley led me to the er on a couple of occasions. At first I didn't put 2 and 2 together (the correlation between vaping and stomach pains) but sitting in the doctors office in early 2015 he asked me if I've changed anything or if I'm doing anything different and I said well yes...I started vaping in mid/late 2013. At that time I was using high pg eliquids and 18-24mg nic (for a year) and I did some research and found out pg can cause stomach pains as well as other ailments. I switched to MaxVg ejuices and went down to 3mg nicotine and it was much better. Unfortunately I got H.Pylori (no joke I think it came from dirty juice bc back then I got my ejuice from the flea market) and I was in pain from that and had to take antibiotics. As some ppl know I was in the hospital in September for pancreatitis which imo can't be from vaping (but who knows) but I'm still vaping and my stomach is much better now. Long story short switch to lower nicotine and get rid of pg and hopefully that'll work. I know MaxVg has some pg in it but I've been doing ok with MaxVg. This is just my personal experience, you might switch to maxvg and low nic and see zero improvement but it's worth a shot. If you can't use ur Juul there are other similar style vapes u can use that let you put ur own ejuice in it. If you like a tight draw the innokin endura t20 or t20s is really good. \u000a\u000a*EDIT* The [Limitless Ply Rock Pulse] (https://www.elementvape.com/ply-rock-x-limitless-mod-co-pulse-pod-system) has refillable pods (you can use ur own ejuice).
p353
aVWhats cheaper to do use? Mods with E-Juice or Juuls?\u000a\u000aI've been considering getting a Juul but I want to first know that price of using it compared to a mod. 
p354
aVAn open system is going to be far cheaper than using a juul. The expensive part is finding a setup and juice you like
p355
aVWell if you\u2019re interested in a juul type system, you could get one that has an open pod so you can use your own juice.
p356
aVMods with tanks and juice you refill yourself is a LOT cheaper than a Juul. Those pods are very expensive, hard to get sometimes, only have a few flavor options and only hold like 1.7ml. You're much better off with an open system imo. But something like the Joyetech Penguin/Dolphin might be a solid option that's kinda in the middle. They're only like $25 and hold 8.8 or 6ml of juice respectively and they're small and compact like a Juul. Not quite as small but little enough to fit nicely in your pocket
p357
aVGrandpa has lung cancer, should I get him a Juul?\u000a\u000aMy grandpa has been smoking since he was a teenager and it\u2019s caught up to him, recently diagnosed with lung cancer. I got him a Juul before his diagnosis to help him stop smoking, does anyone know if Juuls would still be harmful to him?\u000a\u000aAnyone have experience with this? How much worse is cigarettes vs. juuls? Sorry if this question doesn\u2019t fit into the thread, I\u2019m trying to see how I can help him 
p358
aVfresh air &gt; juul &gt; cigs. though, if you have lung cancer that should be a strong enough threat to your life to make you want to go cold turkey.
p359
aVNeither are great but a Juul or vape would be better than cigarettes. a regular vape might be better\u000a
p360
aVReally sorry to hear. Just lost my father in law to cancer. Same situation. Juul would be better. 
p361
aVThe figure put out by studies is 95% safer for vaping in general.\u000a\u000aThe juul is a very low output device,if he's still smoking it will be a drastic improvement.
p362
aVThank you for your advice guys! I will definitely ask his doctor if it\u2019s okay, my grandpa wants to quit smoking but he\u2019s doing it gradually, so now he\u2019s trying to smoke only 2-3 cigarettes per day. He hates the gum/ patches, so as long as the doctor says it\u2019s okay, I think the Juul will be a good alternative to the cigarettes. 
p363
aVI think you would fit right in on /r/juul 
p364
aVSychophantom has the right idea, a more involved set up will certainly provide you with a better experience, and something like the pico/Super Tank Mini would be a great set up.\u000a\u000aIf that doesn't sound like something you're interested in, I'd suggest looking into Innokin's line of produts, most notably the endura series. They'll be very similar to that smok stick you've got, but Innokin has a great reputation for quality and ease of use. I got a friend of mine the T22, and it's a great product.\u000a\u000aOther all in one (AIO) options would be the pod devices that have been big this year. I don't have much experience with them, but lots of folks here seem to love them.\u000a\u000aThe Juul would be another AIO thing to consider, though it's a bit pricey to own/operate from what I understand. Again, no experience with this device, so I can only say most feedback I've read is pretty positive.
p365
aVIf you mean very small, then definitely take a look at the juul. If you haven\u2019t heard of it, it\u2019s a pod system so they\u2019re pre filled and have nicotine salts so it had a smoother hit.
p366
aVThe ultimate vape in public device is a Juul, even though a lot of people here don't like it.  It's expensive to run all the time but it's the closest experience to a cigarette there is.  
p367
aVThe only other pod type system I\u2019ve tried is the icare and Juul. I love my Juul. Swear by it but I love my drop too. What other pods have you used?
p368
aVThe Boulder Rock, which I like but has an annoying whistle. I don't buy pod systems that aren't refillable because it's too expensive. I make my juice so I really can't defend paying for Juul pods. Do ypu hack your Juul pods to refill?
p369
aVYes I definitely refill my Juul Pods. I am a huge fan of how the cucumber and mango pods taste. I would kill for some good cucumber juice. Do you make Salt Nics? 
p370
aVIs it possible for you to return the Alien altogether and get a different mod? I never had anything but problems with my Alien. It sucks because the potential is there. But it's just little things like...the top fill door swinging open in my pocket every day. The battery door not shutting right from day 1. Etc.\u000a\u000aCan you go get a Juul or cigalike (blu etc) to tide you over and swap it out? That's really my only suggestion, unfortunately. I'm sorry. I switched over to the VooPoo drag recently and am very, very happy.
p371
aVQuestion for all y'all Juulers...\u000a\u000aSo I've been vaping a while now this isn't to get off the analogs. I love MTL as a secondary vape. I really vape single coil around 50 watts as my primary vape, sometimes dual coil flavor chasing attys. I got a Mi-one and I love it but I just toss some 6mg freebase nic in it at the moment. I don't really mix with salt nics all that often and the times that I have (I'm out of salt nic ATM too) I just make 3mg for my normal devices. I've never really mixed for a MTL device, although I don't see it being so hard of an adjustment. I'm considering a Juul though but for 50 bucks I don't wanna be let down the same way I was with the MyJet. \u000a\u000aSo (excuse my longwindedness) my question is this: Is the Juul really all that great or would I be just as satisfied buying some more coils for my MiOne and getting some good Mr. Salt-E or something?\u000a\u000aThanks in advance. 
p372
aVThe Juul is a great device, but with the steep price tag and non-refillable pods, you can do much better with your money. I'd love to suggest a few mods but MTL vaping isn't my forte. 
p373

aVI quit my job last month and starting selling Juuls full time outside of schools. I sell them for double retail and make atleast $100 a day. Easy money. 
p375
aVGreat, an opportunity to hop on my alt account and talk shit.\u000a\u000aJuul/Ploom is one of the oddest birds i've encountered. I was at the Miami show a month before they launched and tested them out and put in a small pre-order. I've had them at all locations since launch and they've been nothing short of a nightmare of a company to work with. They routinely take months to fill orders and have never, ever caught up to the demand. Sure, its cool you have a hot product and all, but they've seemingly done nothing to support their retailers. Its rumored they do this on purpose to drive people to their site for orders, but even on the site they have delays and backorders. If you don't want to sell them in shops and want to just sell online, JUST TELL ME SO. I'm perpetually stuck in a spot where I can't tell them to "fuck off" because customers are beating down my door looking for pods. I don't know what they put in those pods, but Juul customers are like rabid lemmings looking for their fix, so i'm forced to keep stocking it. I just have to put in a $30k order and hope that they'll show up in under 3 months.\u000a\u000aI was glad that Phix and Von Erl converted a few of those customers, but still the demand is high. As a company with so much rolling in, I find it astounding that they need to do a round of fundraising to finance whatever they're doing. \u000a\u000aHere's an idea Juul: If you need to raise money, how about selling some fucking product? You've got endless PO's but you can't get your supply chain together after a year? \u000a\u000aI'm well aware that i'm the odd man out when it comes to financial and investment strategy. The correct thing to do is ignore your fundamental business and make up a bunch of fluffy optimistic numbers and get a bunch of VC whales to bankroll whatever hair-brained project you shat out. Then, you funnel out funds into bonuses and salaries until the money dries up and you do it all over again. Maybe i'm reaching here - - i'm reaching.\u000a\u000aAnyway, i'm jealous of Juul, that they can make a product so hot it doesn't matter if they fulfill it because people will line up and wait until they're goddamn good and ready to put it out. I wish I had that kind of product. Until then, i'll begrudgingly fork over cash and wait like a good little bitch for them to send me product.
p376
aVLmfao.. I\ufe0f thought I\ufe0f was subscribed to r/juul it\u2019s too damn early..
p377
aV&gt;I don't know what they put in those pods, but Juul customers are like rabid lemmings looking for their fix\u000a\u000aCan confirm. Switched from high quality open system rigs that this sub loves to Juul. Am rabid lemming.\u000a\u000aI loved my Kayfun but it is nothing next to the Juul. 
p378
aVI dont get it.\u000a\u000aI'm a volume vaper. I like vaping a lot, not taking a few vapes and not vaping for a while. I'm chucking that shit 24/7. Juul makes me nauseous and the battery dies fast. Good for in-flight vaping, but not great for day to day (for me)

aVNeed money? I have a crazy idea. How about you actually make your Juul pods so people can buy them.\u000a\u000aYou are already charging way more than you should for the fucking things.  How about using that profit to actually, you know, make more, than just sell those. With the massive demand you have for pods, it should be pretty easy to come up with that 150 million.
p380
aVMy shop sells juul, and while it was a bit Rocky at first due to their high demand, I get large orders from them every week with no problem. That being said, I still do so alternate pod-based devices just to help alleviate the demand for them. They have really stepped their game up since they first started.
p381
aVI've tried to respond multiple times but can't quite articulate what I'm trying to say.\u000a\u000aI think you nailed it at the end with the "for me" thing.  If there's anything this sub has taught me, it is that different people have divergent preferences in regards to how to ingest their  nicotine.\u000a\u000aWith the Juul craze in particular, I think there are two factors of why it is so popular:\u000a\u000a-It is incredibly easy.  I bought my first Juul because I was going on a trip and bringing my mod, juice, cotton, etc wasn't practical.  The masses aren't into the hobby side.  I was for a while but I learned from this trip that I really dug the no hassle, maintenance free approach.\u000a\u000a-This is the bigger one for the craze, I think.  **Juul is addictive af.**  Like, cigarette level of addicting.  The fact that you can get away with using it in many places that you can't smoke probably adds to this.  I too am a volume vaper -- I'm hitting my Juul all day everyday.  I am under no illusions here: I am insanely addicted to this thing.  I'm sure that is driving demand.      
p382
aVI was waiting for someone to jab me on this.\u000a\u000aVaping on a plane is definitely a bad idea. Not only does it make vaping look worse than it already is (can it get worse?) but it can also ding your wallet. IIRC, its a $2500 fine if they catch you.\u000a\u000aHowever, I take heavy precautions when I do it. When I see a lot of people vaping in places they shouldn't, they make **no effort** to conceal the vape. They exhale normally as if they aren't capable of holding it in and exhaling slowly, or they simple don't care and are authentic douche nozzles. \u000a\u000aWhen I vape at 30,000 feet, I take great care and preparation to position myself for full concealment. I put my sunglasses on and envelop myself in a cocoon using the provided $0.25 fleece blanket. I then nod to the side as if i'm asleep. Little do they know i'm actually awake (haha!) and preparing to strike. I've already secured the Von Erl / Phix / Juul in my hand deep inside the cocoon I ready it for action. I wait for the precise moment that the stewardess is walking away from me into the galley and bring it to my mouth, drag, and hold. The hold is the important part and where most people fail. You don't need to exhale like you normally would. The exhaust is what gets  you caught, and you need to hold that in. Finally, engage in a series of short exhaust puffs **through the nose**. This is key. Between these pulses, you inhale 30% more than you exhaled. This seems to reduce the amount of vapor until it's virtually nothing. Additionally, you want to keep your window closed. Light rays will show the vapor and get you nicked. In a pinch, you can also use the aforementioned $0.25 fleece blanket to exhale into and reduce the vapor further.\u000a\u000aIn closing, I know plane vaping is wrong, but with the effort I put into concealment I am certain nobody is aware of what i'm doing and i'm not contributing to the negative perception of vaping.

aVHIT THE JUUL
p384
aVI'm used to it. I've never even seen a Juul irl. Lul 
p385
aVI use my Juul when I\u2019m out and about, mostly beacause it\u2019s so much easier to carry around than a regular mod and juice.  However, when I\u2019m back at home, I\u2019m on my squonker pretty much the whole time.  I\u2019ve not really noticed any addictive qualities to the Juul other than the convenience of only needing to carry one extra pod and maybe an extra battery if I\u2019m out running errands - I switch back and forth all the time.  I\u2019m actually on a business trip with my Juul right now and really missing my squonker and regular juice...
p386
aVI have a love hate relationship with Juul. But I can't bring myself to use clunky mods or separate coils/separate juice.\u000a\u000aIn your opinion, what's a better pod system with the same type of functionality/quality at a lower price point? \u000a\u000aI'm a heavy user at a pod a day and sometimes I run out before my autoshipment comes. I'd like to switch to something cheaper but I'm busy with work and Juul just works
p387
aVIt's **ALWAYS** too damn early when it comes to r/juul.
p388
aVDo juuls destroy the throats of anybody else? \u000a\u000aI mean I totally stopped vaping after getting my SO a juul to switch from smoking. And every time I hit it DESTTTTTOORRROOOOYED my throat. Like incredibly harsh. \u000a\u000aIt seems like they're products are incredibly inconsistent, a ton of the pods we bought locally were tasteless (menthol) and leaking when we got them. 
p389
aVI feel like a third party company from another country is missing out on a huge opportunity by not selling refillable juul pods. I'd be all over those. 
p390
aVWhat do you think makes Juul so good compared to other vapours?
p391
aVPercentage wise? It's pretty obvious the juul smoker is using upwards of 50mg compared to the average vapers 3-6mg
p392
aVOh I definitely 100% agree. When I tried a juul I thought "damn I haven't had a buzz in years!"
p393
aVAh the Juul, every kid on my campus has one and laughs at my voopoo for not being a vape. 
p394
aVI had no problems switching from cancer sticks to e-juice. So, the Juul doesn't appeal to me. Especially when I consider the price. 
p395
aVThey are super discrete, dead simple to use, and reliable. I've been vaping for 5-6 years and I was getting really tired of getting the random bad coil in a pack, occasional leakage, buying juice online because all the local vape shops sell juice that was saccharine-sweet, etc. \u000a\u000aEverything about the Juul is easy. You drop a pod on the Juul and draw. The battery lasts quite a while since you're not taking multiple long hits to satisfy your craving. To charge it, you just drop it on the charger. I've not had a single official Juul pod with a burnt taste, though I've had some that don't hit as hard as others. Since they're so small, they lend themselves well to people like myself that fidget from time to time. I'm looking at some alternatives to Juul, but they'll have a pretty high bar to reach. \u000a\u000aThe downsides to the Juul is the cost, availability, and variety of pods, and they are more addictive than regular vaping. I was on my out of the vaping game when I tried a Juul. At that point I hadn't hit my vape in a couple of days, and I wasn't going to touch analogs. I stupidly tried the Juul and was instantly hooked -- the hit is definitely similar to a cigarette. I can definitely see why they're popular with the high school to college-aged crowd, which is unfortunate because a lot of them didn't grow up smoking, so they're picking up a needless habit.
p396
aVI would definitely say the reliability of the Juul would be up for debate as you can probably see in the comments and are you not worried at the amount of nicotine you're consuming? I was informed it was around the 50mg range which is ridiculously high comparing to the usual 3, 6 or 12mg dosage.
p397
aVVery similar experience here as well. I\u2019ve been Vaping for 5 years and have started used everything from cigalikes to high end mech mods and attys. I was also weaning off it getting a bit tired of the hobby (time consuming and $$$$) and the Juul got me hooked instantly. It reminded me of why I started vaping and the ease of use and quick portable nic fix keeps me using it. \u000a\u000aI\u2019ve since used a handful of similar systems but they all fall a bit short in some way. I recently got to try a phix last week and it may very well be the closest thing to a Juul if not on par with it. The downside to me is the device is considerably bigger and the pods require tools to pull apart. I love that it uses magnetic pods since the Juul pods become loose over time. I really wish someone combine the 2 devices and created one with easy to refill pods. The Juul pods last me about 4 refills so that helps even out the costs. Even if they were cheaper however, I\u2019d still opt to refill since there are so many better nic salt juices out there (ex flavor chaser). 
p398
aVEverything in my post is true for me. The Juul could be a very unreliable product in general but I've never experienced major issues with it in the four or so months I've been using it.\u000a\u000aRegarding the amount of nicotine, it is far higher than standard vapes per hit, but you're also taking less hits. Trying to vape a Juul as you would a mod won't work. Not sure if that's true for other nicotine salt-based systems.
p399
aVWhy anyone would get a Juul when the Suorin Air exists is beyond me.  Well I guess brand recognition and convenience. 
p400
aVcheck /r/juul    
p401
aVThere's a reason people are feinding for juul pods no? More so than other devices. It's a fact juul pods are more addictive you can ask anyone who's used multiple devices, maybe not from the concentration but the nicotine salts themselves. 
p402
aVSee I can't quantify that, but I use similar strength nic salts in stronger devices and don't feel the same "addiction" I did when using Juul. 
p403
aVI put my old mod at 220 for my friends with juuls and they lost their fucking minds. 
p404
aVMy mom just started using one and she can hardly feel it since she's used to cigs. I tried it and it's quite strong. About as strong as using 12mg juice with freebase nic, even though the juul is 50mg nic salt.
p405
aVThe reason why they're so addictive is because of the Benzoic acid they put into the juices. The 5% nicotine is equal to 59mg nic/ ML per pod. \u000a\u000aThe benzoic acid is that allows the nicotine to be absorbed into the body at a much faster rate. Hence why the consumer always receives the experience of their first cigarette after hitting the juul for the first time of the day. Every. Day.\u000a\u000a https://support.juulvapor.com/home/learn/faqs/juulpods-juice    -     Sauce \u000a\u000aI manage multiple vape shops and receiving 25+ calls a day about juul pods can easily be aggravating . \u000a\u000aAlso, a customer is paying 16.99-19.99$+ for a pack of pods. In each pod is 0.7 ML , so they're paying close to $20 for 2.4ML of juice. That's over $170 for a freaking 30ML!!!! I want to feel sympathy for the juul users, and I try to explain the math to my customers but a lot are too intransigent to switch to a Suorin or a breeze.
p406
aVI read that same article and I own a Saurin and a Pulse. They arent nearly as good a product. They give dry hits and leak ultra high juice into your mouth. \u000a\u000aThe reason Juuls are taking over the market is because they are simply the best nicotine delivery system on the market.\u000a\u000aThat's all ecigs are. Nicotine delivery systems. \u000a\u000aEveryone is throwing a fit because they used science to find a better way to do it.
p407
aVOr for people that physically cannot fill pods and tanks or fuss around with the other nuances of vaping. I just bought a Juul for my sister because it's literally the best option for her (has MS and terrible tremors, she shakes so much there is no way in hell she would be able to fill a pod on a different device). 
p408
aVNo its WAY more addictive. I know from personal experience. I have all kinds of devices from series mechs and rdas to a nautilus tanks and micro vapes. \u000a\u000aAt .14-.17 ohms and 3mg.... I cant EVER get close to a nic buz like a juul. \u000a\u000aIf it was 12mg or 18mg in the juul or even 20, not a big difference. But at 50mg, its a huge difference. 
p409
aVHahaha dude... Hit your juul.
p410
aVEverybody I know has experienced dry hits and spitting from their juul.
p411
aVYeah.. don\u2019t do that.\u000a\u000aThat was what originally got me to transition from RDAs to a juul. I hated how obnoxious the clouds were especially when people would chuck clouds during highly populated areas. The juul was preferable to me because it was discrete and it did not bother those around me.
p412
aVI don't know how you deal with these people. They sound like heroin addicts. This is one of the top posts of the sub:\u000a\u000a\u000a&gt;hey reddit, my name is Max and I'm an 18 year old senior in high school. I just wanted to give some light on what the Juul is like at my high school, because honestly what it has become is truly fascinating. To start, vaping in the Men's bathroom was always a frowned upon activity. Kids would shit on others for it, and even smoking cigs people look down upon (except for the angsty kids that listen to Mac Demarco and such). But what I love about the Juul, is it has become so addicting that it has become seen as cool, almost as a way for people to subconsciously cope with their addiction. Between classes the big bathroom in my school averages 20-25 kids, and 5-10 juuls. Kids usually will give you a dollar for a juul rip if you don't know them, if you want to buy a pod for 5$ you just head into the bathroom after lunch. We call the kids in there between every class begging for rips "Juul fiends." Pod boys are the freshman that say "can i put my pod in ur juul?" and are in there every block. I myself spent about 180$ on mango pods and bought out a store, and sold these pods for 10$ a pod, making myself an absolutely massive profit in literally 9 days. Given because I'm 18 with a car and that's the tobacco age around here, I always get offers to get pod runs or juuls for kids. people even understand the best system to get a head rush in your 2 minutes between classes, is all the juuls at once. So someone yells "GIVE ME ALL THE JUULS" and 3-7 are passed around, two hits each. This saves us all juice, and gives you a massive head rush. Kids also scratch logos and words onto their juuls to make in their own, every day you can find the pod covers in my student parking lot. I know this sounds exaggerated, but with a school with 1400 kids near the city and juuls being perceived as popular, it's truly fascinating what can happen. Also, one smoke shop had the crisp pear pods, and a kid sold them for 15$ a piece. Those pods are fucking amazing by the way, they taste like a green apple jelly beans. Well, just thought I'd type this out to see if anyone has a similar experience to me in their school or was interested in it, if you have any questions i'm happy to answer. Thanks for reading!
p413
aVJesus that was some horrid shit to read. I figured out the douchyness of it when a customer who was in between HS and freshman year kept asking if I had pods in. Then another day I had about 4 groups walk in, and not shitting here, 5 phone calls in one day asking for pods. I've been doing this almost 5 years and this was out of the blue. Finally asked my younger customer what the fuck, why that instead of the 9 other options we have? \u000a\u000a"It's small, portable, sleek, and you don't use it as often. Oh and it's really smooth for being high nic"\u000a\u000aThen I remember he never smoked. \u000a\u000aAnd that's when I realized that kids are vaping it just for the nic buzz. Whatever their marketing is (I haven't seen any) is working.\u000a\u000aJuul is fucking Joe the camel. 
p414
aVHow many refills can you get out of the pods? Do you have a Juul as comparison? It\u2019s caught my eye however every Juul alternative I\u2019ve tried so far is now collecting dust. I\u2019m looking for a similar draw. Any leaking issues? I saw that suorin also has a new device coming out called the ishare (stick device with pcc). 
p415
aVI feel you. I work for a vape shop and getting ahold of these bastards are a process. I\u2019m in the Texas Tech area so students are obsessed with these. Just recently have we been able to get ahold of a good amount of Juuls and the pods and it\u2019s been great for business but still I definitely agree with you. 
p416
aVI know people who go through a pod every day, easily. When they are out drinking, they'll kill a pod in a night. Ezpz. And it's not just like one person out of a hundred who does that, it is a lot of customers who tell me the same thing. My shop is located in a highly populated area with a lot of locals AND tourists. So I meet people from all over the US who uses the juul.
p417
aVIts kind of common sense. Different nic levels at different quantities of vapor deliver different amounts of nicotine. Resulting in a nicotine rush. Basically if you dont get one with device a, and you get one with device b, then you are absorbing more nicotine with device b. Just because you like to be condescending and and ass hole, it doesnt change the fact that juul delivers WAY more nicotine than 95% of devices/set ups out there.\u000a
p418
aVLmao no its both. Of course it has moatly to do with the fact that its a nicotine salt. Im not illiterate. Ive used juul before. Ive done my research on it before. And i know what im talking about. But the fact that its still 50mg per ml is ridiculously high. And the fact that it absorbs so quckly into your system means you are getting all that nicotine even faster. \u000a\u000aWhich gives you the nic buzz. Idl why you keep repeating that stupid phrase over and over. That must be all YOU care about.... \u000a\u000aI know for a fact that my nicotine tolerance was sky high while i used the juul. It was higher concentrations that absorbed faster. \u000a\u000aIf you compare it to any other product that i used, it only made me more addicted to nicotine. \u000a\u000aIdk why you keep arguing with me about this. 
p419
aVTalk like that gets you banished to r/juul 
p420
aVLook man, if Juuling on some dope mango pods makes you wrong, I don't want to be right.\u000a\u000aCan't wait for the Juul craze to die.
p421
aVI fear the juul scene will never die. \u000a\u000aWas another shit show today in ECR. So many people posting about RTA and **BEST** lol
p422
aVI wouldve never believed I could quit, never in a million. \u000a\u000aMy kids bought me a Juul...and that was bankrupting me so I got my own ....and thank the Gods for this place. Im freaking thrilled I found it! 
p423
aVA good stealth device?\u000a\u000aSick of carrying a G-PRIV around all the time. Just to make it quick. I want a super small device. Mod or aio. For now I'm between the iCare mini, IC 2 and Breeze or Juul(which is really difficult to get because I'm in Greece and need to pay a ton of shipping fees, alternatives are welcome). If you have any recommendations I would really appreciate it, thank you very much!
p424
aVIf she smokes menthol, that Juul will be the closet to a cigarette hit she'll find. Thats what got me off the stinkies! 
p425
aVI've heard great things about the Juul, but haven't tried it yet.  I tried the Von Erl, the Limitless (Plyrock) Pulse, and the Phix.  Von Erl died after a month.  Pulse has pods you need to fill yourself. Not too difficult but adds a bit of mess and complexity.  Phix is little more econonomical then Juul.  Phix pods hold a little more than the Juul pods and are 50mg of nicotine. For on the town and in the car,  I use the Phix.  If you are willing to deal with coil replacements and e-juice refilling, the Aspire Breeze works pretty good with some 25mg nicotine salt e-juice.
p426
aVShit man. Went to Circle K and got my sister a Juul for Christmas... $82 for the device and four pods.. what a fucking racket!
p427
aVShe has MS, is in a wheelchair, and has horrible tremors. The Juul seemed liked the best option with no refilling and pods are readily available around here. Was going to go with the Boulder Rock but there\u2019s no way she can manage to fill the pods. 
p428
aVYeah I have a pulse. But I don\u2019t see her often enough to be sure I can always have pods filled so the Juul was literally my best option. I\u2019ve been going back and forth on this decision for a few weeks now. 
p429
aVOf course. I\u2019m the same way. She\u2019s just not capable of filling her own pods or anything so I need the most plug and play option available and the Juul is it at this point. 
p430
aVLogic seems to have stepped up their game. Went from a Juul to this, and I\u2019m pretty impressed. On another note, any idea how to refill the cartos?\u000a\u000a
p431
aVCan anyone in the uS help me get a juul ecig kit?\u000a\u000aReddit is always so helpful and after many attempts including contacting Juul, I've come out empty handed each time.\u000a\u000aI am now turning to fellow redditors (particularly US residents) to help me get my hands on a Juul ecig kit and perhaps a box or two of the catridges as well.\u000a\u000aI will happily pay the cost and shipping. Please let me know if this is something you'd be willing to help me with since Canada sells none and the few places you can find it are either not in the same locale and or charge 3-4x the price.\u000a\u000awith love, \u000ayour neighbor up north :)

aVHelp recommending my boss a setup?\u000a\u000aMy boss is trying to get off cigs and wants something that closely resembles them. He has a cheap cigalike now but he definitely needs something better. He does NOT want a mod or anything complex, which is why I have no idea what to recommend lol. \u000a\u000aI would recommend the juul to him but those pods get pricey. Small form factor is a must though.\u000a\u000aThanks!
p437
aVYeah, realistically I find cigalikes don't work for most people trying to quit but that depends on your vaping preferences.  I suppose something like the juul would work.  I second the zelos kit.
p438
aVHonestly Juul is still the way to go. If he's already a heavy smoker, then the initial cost will not be more than smoking. Eventually he will taper down and start to save money. Juul really is by far the best device for people who aren't interested in the hobbyist side of things.
p439
aVWhats the big deal about the juuls?\u000a\u000aI see everyone using and buying all these juuls and phix\u2019s. 
p440
aVUnder 18 crowd. They are in every gas station and extremely easy for underagers to get. Rather than go into a store like ours and get id'ed, they go with the juul. 
p441
aVI really like my juul as a second device. I refill the pods with 50mg salt nic and its a nice cigarette-like hit for when I don't want to blow clouds. I usually use it at work so I don't annoy people. In terms of vape quality for a mtl I'd much rather use my squape rs or kayfun prime but it's much more upkeep compared to the pod devices and I'm lazy 
p442
aVThe Juul is an awesome little device, but its image is being trashed by all the kids glomming onto it.\u000a\u000aIt gives the closest approximation to an actual cigarette I've experienced. Also very no-fuss in its operation, which is great for anybody who doesn't want vaping as a hobby, but just as an alternative to smoking cigarettes. \u000a\u000aThe drawback is the expense. The pods are very expensive. $4 on the cheap end, $6 or more in high-tax states. 
p443
aVwell juuls have their own proprietary salt nicotine formula and both are super portable
p444
aVYeah. A pod is roughly a pack. The price comparisons vary by state. For example, smokes in CA are now about $7 a pack, and pods are $6 each. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s intentional on JUUL\u2019s part. \u000a\u000aSo if you\u2019re comparing to cigarettes, it\u2019s still cheaper. But not nearly as cheap as vaping on a more conventional mod/atomizer combo.

aVPIC: Charge MyJet with Juul charger\u000a\u000ahttps://imgur.com/a/F2zcd\u000a\u000aSup Reddit! Finally made an account. Sorry if I'm posting this incorrectly. I broke off the sides of my juul charger and placed a bit of wire from an old phone cable on one of the metal nipple on the Juul charger. The MyJet seems to be charging just fine.

aVI've used the following:\u000a\u000a* **Suorin Air**  - refillable 2ml pods are nice. One went bad on the 2nd fill, but the other 2 I've tried lasted longer. Lots of posts about these failing. So far so good but I want to find a replacement.\u000a\u000a* **Phix** - I liked this device a lot, and really enjoyed the Butterscotch Tobacco but the pods spit back and leak to the point I was constantly blowing through it to clear juice before using.\u000a\u000a* **iCare v1** - hated this, constant dry hits and just bad performance.\u000a\u000a* **Envii Fitt** - this was pretty nice. Good variety of flavors, though the pods did leak some. Might try it again with refillable pods.\u000a\u000a* **Juul** - I used Juul for a year and a half but their QC is garbage, they seem to have changed the flavors some, and the popularity with high school kids means pods can be hard to find.\u000a\u000a* **Innokin Pocketmod** - So far this is my favorite of the bunch. Solid build, bulkier than the others but the 1.2ohm coils work well with nic salts. Will buy another.\u000a\u000a\u000aI also want to try the Fuchai v3, Warlock Peas, and Kimsun Slim 2R.

aVI'd love a good dry herb tank bro, I'll have to look into it. I've used a concentrate tank before and it was dope, as for MTL the juuls been getting mad good reviews, I've used one and it was good honestly no throat hit. high mg nicotine salt pod system, but the nic salt doesn't have a throat hit it's fire

aVConstruction is a bitch for box mod. Any suggestions for heavy duty gear?\u000a\u000aWorking in construction kills my stuff. Ive resorted to a juul for now, but I miss puffing doomsday. The last mod I had was a siegeli j150 and it was awesome. I loved the fact that I didn't have to carry batteries and it would last me a full work day. It suffered short drops on to concrete, environmental temperatures, lots of bending, lifting, dust, lots of fucking dust. I took relatively good care of it. I would clean it regularly and charge the battery every night. It stopped holding a charge after a fall, so that shit the bed. I need something that's going to withstand abuse. And a lot of it. Like a punching bag with a pussy hole. Suggestions?

aVWhich beginner pocket pen to choose?\u000a\u000aHello. I want to buy a small compact pen that would be stealth in my pocket. I dont need more than 10mg of nicotine (super light cigs alternative) and the prefilled pod ones dont carry to much of low nicotine. I would prefer to have changable pods so I could switch flavors buts its not a must. It would be nice if it would give big clouds and would be solid enough to not do any dripping in my pocket. Ive read lots of reviews and I am considering these:\u000a\u000a- Aspire Breeze, its little bulky, the liquid fill system is not great, no replacable pods\u000a\u000a- Suorin Air, I like that its so thin but Im not sure if its comfortable to use, the battery is not too big\u000a\u000a- Suorin Drop, i like how it looks little better than Air\u000a\u000a- iCare 2, I dont think there is anything to complain about here, they fixed the driping issues\u000a\u000a- iCare Solo, I like the design for me, its similar to Juul, dont know too much about this, there isnt many comparison\u000a\u000a- Boulder Rock, I like the design as well but there is not many reviews regarding it, people are saying that its a refillable version of Juul(?), Its very inexpensive\u000a\u000a- Rofvape Warlock Peas, dont know to much about it, looks good, draw to fire which I like\u000a\u000aWhich would you recommend? \u000a\u000aAlso what liquid should I get? Mr Salty gets the best reviews but they do not offer low nicotine lvl liquids. Is it worth getting salt nic with low nicotine lvls? What would you suggest?
p462
aVYou can definitely get that \u201cfirst drag\u201d feeling with a Juul or high nic salt device. Still not the same as lighting up that first cigarette in the morning though

aVExcise tax inconsistency Question\u000a\u000aHey all,\u000a\u000aI am purchasing my Mom a Juul starter kit for an xmas gift... with the Excise tax the total goes from $50 to $75. While I do not mind paying it for a gift my concern is trying to find my mom the cheapest solution when she needs to by more pods.\u000a\u000a[MN Department of Rev](http://www.revenue.state.mn.us/businesses/tobacco/Pages/e-Cig.aspx) (my home state) claims *\u200bCartridges/e-juice containing nicotine* are eligible for Excise tax.  However if I shop on myvaporstore and buy a juice vial there is zero Excise Tax.  \u000a\u000aIs this because the Juul Pods are non-refillable and a glass vial of juice is?  I ask this because the MN Dept of Rev also states "*Reusable/refillable device &amp; components*" are not subject to Excise  tax.\u000a\u000aI cannot circumvent this problem as Juul "pods" are sold exclusively on their website to the best of my knowledge.  Are they forcing the customer to pay their California tax so they can stay in business?\u000a\u000aI'm lost here and I'm not finding a lot of great answers by Googling. Thanks for the advice.
p464
aVThis is answered explicitly on the website you linked to.  Distributors pay the excise tax.  Purchasers outside that supply chain are expected to self-report and pay a "Tobacco Use Tax" (only) if their consumption is more than $50/month.\u000a\u000aJuul is also sold all over the place, not sure where you got that business about website exclusivity.  They have a store finder.\u000a\u000aAll that said, the best solution for your mom is probably the one that is easiest for her. Nothing sends a smoker back to cigarettes like suddenly realizing you have to wait a week for eliquid. Literally any e-cigarette option is going to be cheaper than smoking if you've already paid for the hardware.  Highly suggest checking the retail options around her and picking a solution that allows stocking up locally if a shipment is delayed.\u000a\u000aOblig: Not your lawyer. Don't take Internet legal advice.

aVBeginner cig-a-like vape - low nicotine\u000a\u000aHi. I am a newbie in cigs and e cigs. I did use vape before they become popular, then started to smoke regular cigs but eventually stopped smoking very fast. Right now I feel the need of smoke sometimes, probably due to stress. I want something with little to no throat hit, 6-10mg/ml of nicotine would be enough. I bought few Blu pens and I pretty much like them, however I would prefer to stay below 2.4% of nicotine. I doubt Blus have 2.4% anyways. Blu is pretty annoying without any battery indicator, it also does not give too much cloud and it does not have many flavors to choose from. I would like something as much compact as Blu that would fit in my pocket without notice. It can be either disposable or rechargable or fillable. I dont want to invest much money in it. I seen a lot of Vuse pens at gas stations, but never tried them.\u000aI tried Juul but they contain too much nicotine for me. I also thought about Myjet so I could just use my own liquid. \u000a\u000aWhat would you recommend?\u000a\u000a\u000aThanks
p466
aVWhen I used vape in the past, I had few ego batteries 650 and 1300mah, i dont remember all atomizers but I surely had CE5+. As for the coil I dont know the english name for it but it probably was called clearomizer dual coil (?). It was pretty good and gave me huge clouds, but I want something much smaller, more solid with no drips and spills, something more "pocket proof". I dont need a large battery as its going to increase the size of the pen. I would probably not exceed 20 puffs per day, it would be nice to be able to charge in in the car. \u000aI think that Juul would be perfect if I was able to buy lower nicotine level cartridges or was able to fill it up with my own liquid, it looks slick and pocketable. 
p467
aVAs far as I know, nope.\u000a\u000aA pod system really sounds like your best bet. Like the Breeze or Sourin Air. The issue is that pod systems came about from JUUL's being so expensive and non-refillable, so any pod system you will have to fill just like any atomizer.
p468
aVOkay so I am left with 4 vapes to choose from:\u000a\u000a- Aspire Breeze, its little bulky, the liquid fill system is not great, no replacable pods\u000a\u000a- Suorin Air, I like that its so thin but Im not sure if its comfortable to use, the battery is not too big\u000a\u000a- iCare 2, I dont think there is anything to complain about here, they fixed the driping issues\u000a\u000a- iCare Solo, its the best design for me, i like the Juul-like style, dont know too much about this, there isnt many comparison\u000a\u000aWhich would you recommend? 
p469
aVIs refilling Juul pods worth it?\u000a\u000aWent from cigs to mod, now I only Juul and love it except I miss having a variety of flavors to smoke. Is refilling the pods with juice worth it or should I just invest in something like an iCare?
p470
aVI refill my Juul pods. I get about 4 refills in them (clear juices) before they taste a little burnt and I toss them. It\u2019ll still be more expensive than most refillable systems because you inevitably need fresh pods. I have an icare mini I used for a short while but the spitting was too much and I didn\u2019t like the draw/hit that was produced. Ultimately it comes down to preference and budget. 
p471
aVHey Team,\u000aI have just uploaded a video to YouTube on how I refill my pods using a syringe. I\u2019ve figured out a way to refill with NO leaks.\u000a\u000aI am also getting 10+ refills on one pod and it still runs the same as the first time.\u000a\u000aI was living in the US, using Juul, then when I left I had to figure out a way to keep refilling whilst away. I tried all the tutorials and watched all the videos, but always ended up having a leaking pod.\u000a\u000aThis is not for profit or fame, I was just bloody sick of the leaks and wanted to let others know how I do it to prevent them.\u000a\u000aHope it helps team!\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18K0eN4Jq44
p472
aVAny suggestions for an alternative to juul?\u000a\u000aDo they make anything refillable and as lowkey as the juul? The pods  $$ are starting to add up.. I\u2019ve heard that people just refill the pods but it seems too tedious. But lmk, thanks!
p473
aVI'm really digging the Peas from Rofvape. It's like $10-$15 depending where you buy, pods are sized similar to the juul but have a removable butt plug for refilling. 5 packs of empty pods are like $5 and I've been getting about 10 refills out of each pod before it turns a bit meh.
p474
aVI've had my suorin air 2 for about 6 weeks with absolutely 0 problems. I also personally know about 5 other people at my school who are using the air 2 without problems. I know it gets a lot of heat around here but as someone who has no interest in big mods or customizing anything this thing has been amazing. I usually switch pods every 15-20ml of juice (im using the solace nic salt 30mg rn but am going to try out normal juice at 18mg soon) and have never had problems burning out pods or had any leaks. Its less than $30 for the kit and about $3-$4 for the refillable pods which is much cheaper than your juul. Looks cool too
p475
aVI can refill them in under a minute but I\u2019ve done it many many times. Still in search of a refillable alternative that gives me the same experience. So far the phix has been the closest (just as good imo) but refilling them is harder than the Juul and they cost around the same price. 
p476
aVMy mother picked up a Juul because I said it was the simplest option out there. She loves it. I've taken some drags from it and the 50mg/ml is quite powerful and it tastes really damn good for a "cigalike." Really simple use.

aVGetting Juul for my dad who has been a cig smoker for a few years. Is it a better alternative and will he like it more Importantly?\u000a\u000aFor christmas I am thinking about getting my dad a Juul. I just really dont know whether he will like it and just go back to cigs. Has anyone here completely came off cigs and changed to Juul. He obviously is older (60) so he probably isnt going to like the fruit flavors or anything like that.\u000a\u000aAny feedback is helpful.
p479
aV&gt;He obviously is older (60) so he probably isnt going to like the fruit flavors\u000a\u000aWhat does age and liking fruit flavors have in common? The propaganda against vaping must be working.\u000a\u000aThe juul is a fine choice for a smoker quitting, although it can get very expensive because of the pods. If you think he'd prefer to fill his own and save a good 50% (not everyone wants to hassle with that) then there are probably better pod systems out there for him, but the juul is still one of the better non-refillable systems.
p480
aVThe upside to the juul is it's very easy to use and mimics smoking.  The downside is you're locked into its propriety pods when compared with alternatives are very expensive.  If your dad has expressed interest in vaping you may want consider something like the aspire zelos.  If he hasn't, the juul is probably the closest thing to smoking, so it's worth a shot for his health alone.\u000a\u000aEdit: there's only one nicotine level.  Most vaping devices can be very helpful in quitting because you can step down the amount the nicotine.  the juul is much more of a smoking replacement than cession tool. 
p481
aVDon't vape oils. It'll give you pneumonia and possibly kill you.\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aYou might like a pod system. They're about the size of 2-6 cigarettes tied together. Some of them have a button you press that starts them and some just autostart when you begin sucking on the mouthpiece.\u000a\u000aJuuls aren't refillable, but they're popular. You just have to keep buying their pods with their juice in it.\u000a\u000aDon't buy Suorin products; lots of people have issues with them.. probably stay away from Eleaf iCares, too.\u000a\u000aAspire Breeze seems decent, it fires when you draw on it.. Atopack Dolphins seem OK, they have a button that fires them and they can fit a lot of liquid.\u000a\u000aThere are a lot of other pod systems that I'm not aware of. Maybe try watching some YouTube reviews. (Just remember that most reviewers aren't reviewers.. they're salesmen disguised as reviewers. Some are trustworthy, but those guys are few and far between.)\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aIf you really want something the size of a cigarette, you might just go to a gas station and pick up a cigalike. They're honestly crap.. with tiny batteries and not much juice in them, but if you're just an occasional smoker the low entry price might be up your alley. I know I quit smoking using MarkTens from the coupons they sent me through the mail. (Regularly they're ~$10 for one battery and one cartomizer, then ~$10 for two cartomizers. One cart would last me about a day.) I found out you can remove the back of the cartomizers and fill them up with your own eliquid, provided you have a small syringe to get it in there. (Once I did that for a few weeks and decided that I liked vaping, I gave those away to another smoker and bought myself real vape gear.)
p482
aVMonq, Corked, and KININ are basically just all in one vaporizer cartridges with their own battery, tank, and coil. So basically any pen or mod is gonna work just the same or better. I'd look up some threads with recs for pens or pens for beginners and see if anything catches your eye. \u000a\u000aOr you could also find some help on the daily questions thread. If you say what you want from the pen/what your use is, people will generally list off a few recs, just gotta give them something to go off of.\u000a\u000aBasically things like\u000a-can take other e juice/not a closed pod system like the Juul\u000a-has coils for max 100% vg e-Juice (resistance matters depending on the blend of PG/VG, affects the flavor, vaporize times, etc)\u000a-battary usage, etc\u000a\u000aA common rec off the top of my head is the Joye eGo AIO Starter Kit, but I don't personally have any experience with it, sorry!\u000a\u000aYou might also check out /r/ejuice to get better reccomendations since it's a juice focused community.

aVVaping for 2 months. Since day one, I\u2019ve had pain in my lower, side, and mid back. Might be gas/dehydration?. Wondering if anyone else has had this?\u000a\u000aHey guys. I am trying to figure out what it is that is causing this dull pain I\u2019m feeling. I feel it in my lower back sides or sometimes in my stomach. It seems to go away a little bit when I drink more water. A little bit.  But the feeling or pain is all day. From morning to wake. I won\u2019t stop vaping. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not causing me health issues but I need to fine tune something to keep that \u201csymptom\u201d away.  Again idk if it\u2019s gas or dehydration because my Pee looks fine. Maybe 18mg nic is giving me bloat? Maybe cigarette chemicals aren\u2019t completely out of my system yet?\u000a\u000aVape history if that helps: started with a JUul for a month. Switched to 70vg30pg 18mg. Then vaped 60vg40pg liquid. Then tried 12mg 80vg/20pg liquid.  Now when I tried this liquid which tasted amazing. It was giving me really bad cotton mouth. So I did drink a lot of water that night and felt pretty good in the morning for the first time. But I went through 12mg so fast. I had to refill in less than a day. \u000aJust to clarify. Before two months ago I smoked a pack a day camel blue cigarettes for 17 years. \u000a\u000aMaybe i need to switch to subohm at like 3mg or 6mg\u000a\u000aI can\u2019t figure out if it\u2019s the nicotine, vgpg ratio. Sweeteners or if vaping really does dehydrate you more than smoking. \u000a\u000aAny helpful ideas?\u000a\u000a

aVConstant and loud crackling from suorin air.\u000a\u000aI just got my suorin air a few days ago, and it is by far the best stealth vape I\u2019ve bought. It blows every other one on the mainstream market that I\u2019ve tried out of the water in my opinion (JUUL, PHIX, Vuse Vibe, Vuse solo *shudders* , Rubi, Eleaf). The only issue that I have is the constant and almost violent crackling that it produces every time I draw from it. Now I\u2019ve had clearomizers and all of the devices mentioned above, and I haven\u2019t had anything close to this kind of crackling. The worst part is that with the crackle, it produces a blast of hot air (sort of like a mini dry hit) that burns my throat. Could this be attributed to wicking problems, or something else?

aVWhere can you find nicotine salt juice for sale if you don't mind me asking? Juuls are nice but way too expensive in the long run and I can't even find WTA juice.
p490
aVIf you just want a small setup for work and like MTL.. and you've been gone from the vaping scene for two years.. you may be interested in nicotine salt liquids.\u000a\u000aNicotine salt isn't salt; it's a different form of nicotine that's used in vape juice. It enters the body more quickly, so people can get a buzz like with a cigarette.\u000a\u000aWhen people use salt based juice, they usually don't go for 3/6/12mg strengths.. they go for 24/36/48mg strengths and only MTL it. There are new devices called pod systems with 2ml-6ml pods that you can refill (on most of them.) The pods easily fit into your pocket, so people take them on vacation and to work.. and they're a discreet MTL device, so you're not chucking clouds and drawing attention on your vape breaks.. and the high nicotine content means just a few drags is all you need to catch a nicotine buzz and get back to work.\u000a\u000aJuul makes the most popular one, but I think its pods aren't refillable. Stay away from Suorin products (Smok/Eleaf tier quality control, apparently.) Also, I've heard a few bad things about Eleaf's iCare 2.\u000a\u000aI think the better ones are Aspire Breeze / Atopack Dolphin (not Penguin, the Dolphin can MTL, the Penguin can't.) Sigelei and a few other manufacturers are getting into the market, too. Here's the first site I can think of that has a Pod section of devices they sell: http://www.myvaporstore.com/Pod-Systems-Ecig-Starter-Kits-s/525.htm\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aOh, and the nicotine salt juice.. (remember, it's not salty, it refers to the chemical form of the nicotine.)\u000a\u000aHere's a thread where they discuss some vendors and list another thread where other vendors of nicotine salt juices are listed: https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/7i6fww/alternative_nic_salt_companies
p491
aVI highly recommend the juul. I\u2019ve vaping for a couple years now and have switched to a juul for about the past year. I use to enjoy building coils and using bigger mods but don\u2019t have as much time now so the juul is very convenient.
p492
aVKeep an eye out for Juul starter kits cheap - my mate got one for a buck in a Circle K in the Chicago burbs last week - he was buying cigarettes and the machine asked him if he wanted a Juul for a dollar so he did. He still hasn't opened the pack he bought. And he's been drunk at least once since then. I know, I was there.  Super proud of him. 
p493
aVCigalikes\u000a\u000aI'll spare the details and cut to the chase. I'm tired of box mods. They're inconvenient for me. The maintenance is too much. I'm not going back to them. I love you all and how great the innovation and creativity is regarding box mods, but I need the thing to keep me from cigarettes. \u000a\u000a\u000aI started using the Njoy Daily after plenty of experimenting with other cigalikes (logic, blu, juul, markten, and egos). For me, nothing comes close  to the Njoy Daily Extra Full Tobacco. It feels incredible in my mouth like the cigarettes I craved. It draws like one, can sit in my mouth like one, gives the nicotine level I like, and just plain satisfies.\u000a\u000a\u000aBut fuck all is it expensive. Even at the drug store sale price of $5 each, it's still too expensive to switch to. \u000a\u000a\u000aSo here's my question for those of you who can answer it. What exists that has the weight and touch of the Daily with the taste and convenience of the Daily, but is reasonably priced? \u000a\u000a\u000aI haven't tried the Njoy Recharge because rechargeables have that metal click pen casing that negates the feel I'm looking for. Am I wrong? What's the best alternative?\u000a\u000a\u000aPlease don't trash on me for liking it. I know it's not respectable to a lot of you, but I haven't found anything closer to the satisfaction it provides.

aVAs much as I don't like them, JUUL may be your best bet. It's probably the easiest device to use. I ou purchase prefilled pods that you use then discard.\u000a\u000aI don't know your brother though, and what he could or couldn't handle as far as maintenance.  
p499
aVI'd absolutely agree with this except $100 isn't gonna get you that far with Juul - maybe a months worth of pods, but certainly not 6.  They do run periodic starter kits for $1 deals - my mate picked one up in a Circle K in the Chicago burbs last week. Maybe check over at /r/Juul and see if any of the folks over there know if there's anything happening like that near you just now.
p500
aVIt can be a lot to take in. I hear great things about the juul, like most people do. 
p501
aVGet him an atopack dolphin or penguin. Both are made by joyetech, are incredibly inexpensive, coils don't cost as much as the pods for the Juul. Very easy to use. Not as easy as the Juul but it fires harder and you get to vape any flavor you want. 
p502
aVI might recommend a Juul, they are about the size of a USB stick and give the throat hit that many smokers enjoy. Rather than bottles if juice they come in little pods that you swap out when they are empty. Great easy to use device. 
p503
aVA juul would really be the best bet. Or a similar pod system. They're basically plug n play. They have a higher cost due to having to buy pods, though some are refillable.

aVUltraportables might be worth a look. From reading this I think you're in Blighty so the strongest nic you're gonna be able to get is 20mg, but even at that, if you're not smoking much just now, something like a Juul pod is gonna blow your head off. Maybe pair one of them up with juice you're not particularly keen on - sounds a bit daft but if it deters you from firing it up outside of when you're three sheets and everything's out the window maybe so much so the better

aVI'll be getting a dead rabbit (finally, super stoked), some prebuilt coils, and some cotton pads for myself. I'm going to get my mom a juul most likely (some type of pod device) and I've already got my dad an aio device. 
p512
aVGonna get a Juul so I can take quicker smoke breaks when we're busy at work, aka 24/7. Thanks!
p513
aVIt just hit me that you're talking about the iCare and I was talking about the iJust. Derp.. I'm not fully awake, at the moment.. and I'm sitting down, taking breaks from Photoshop and photographing old Masonic hats I'm trying to get on eBay before 8pm EST.\u000a\u000aSorry.. My experience was the same with the *iJust 2*.\u000a\u000aI think Eleaf just makes terri-bad coils.. and stores will never refund anything that's been used. I'd just suggest you save up for another device and learn to distrust Eleaf.\u000a\u000aThe Aspire Breeze / Atopack Dolphin are things I don't hear too many complaints about. Maybe look into one of those. Juuls have non-refillable pods and avoid anything from Suorin like it has leprosy. 
p514
aVOr always have some sort of stealth in your pocket.  That's why I carry a juul around.  
p515
aVStarting again Help\u000a\u000aHey guys, so I have a sad admission. I was one of vapings "success stories." I was a 2 PAD smoker, for about ten years stopped and vaped for 4 years before completely quitting. \u000a\u000aI ran into some life issues and ended up picking up smoking again, and a recent accident exacerbated things and I'm back to almost being 2 PAD. I'm getting tired of it and want to go for vaping again to quit. \u000a\u000aThe last setup I had was a rx200 and a goon, I don't know if I want to get back into a big mod setup again and was considering a juul, everything in the sub and other sources have a lot of back and forth whether the juul is any good or not, that being said are nicotine salts the way to go? Or should I be looking at something else. A bit lost as far as what is out there anymore. \u000a\u000aThanks.
p516
aVIf you want a pod system like a Juul, Aspire Breeze or an iCare 2, go with nicotine salts. 24 / 36 or 48mg strength.\u000a\u000aI think Juuls aren't refillable, though.. so you might be happier with one of the other pod systems. \u000a\u000aOh, and stay far away from Suorin Air or Drop. We get more people coming here having problems with Suorin pods than any other pod.\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aThis link has some companies that sell nic salt juice: https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/7i6fww/alternative_nic_salt_companies In the comments of that post is also another post that has a few more listed.
p517
aVI just recently bought a Juul, and honestly it\u2019s pretty cool. I still have my large 200w box mod to use at home. I have mainly been using the Juul outside of my house. The nic salts work quickly, and I really only need 2-3 puffs off of the Juul at a time. I would recommend giving it a shot.
p518
aVAIO recommendations for Smokers?\u000a\u000aSo my dad has been a smoker for almost 30 years now, and it has been taking a serious toll on his health. He's tried to quit about twice now, and once he was successful for about 3 months, but he returned to them again. I mostly build, but I was looking for some MTL AIO systems that can help him quit.\u000a\u000aHe's tried the Juuls, but said they just didn't feel right. Anyone have a recommendation for a Christmas gift to help him quit smoking? My budget is about ~$100 (doubt it will go that high but anyway).\u000a\u000aThanks!
p519
aVIt sounds great, but would you have a recommendation for something that looks more like a pen? I think the biggest gripe with Juul was that it just didn't feel like a cigarette. I copped an eGo AIO with Mount Baker but I personally didn't like the flavor at all (maybe I am just used to Hadaly and Wasp :/)
p520
aVso my mod just exploded this morning...\u000a\u000a...on the bookshelf at the end of my bed. Fucking woke up to what sounded like a gun shot and look down and see my bookshelf half engulfed in flames. Beinng half a sleep and full retarded I use my blanket to put it out and that caught on fire. Got some water and doused the bitch, and put a cup over the smoldering remains of my mod to put out the flame. Fun morning!\u000a\u000aI don't know if it was an issue with my mod or the batteries (probably batteries) but I think I'm gonna take a break from cloud chucking for a bit. Tbh I'm just really fucking thankful that I was home at the time. \u000a\u000aRIP Smok GX350, good riddance tfv12 for fucking draining all of my juice ;)\u000a\u000aOn a side note, anyone have suggestions for salt/pod vapes? I started using juuls and they're kinda great but if there's something better out there I wanna know about it. Thanks for reading y'all, makes the lingering smoke smell in my room just a bit more bearable :)\u000a\u000aedit: fun pics https://imgur.com/a/FAgPp

aVLooking to get my dad to switch to ecigs, what to buy him for Christmas?\u000a\u000aMy dad is 60 something years old and has been a heavy smoker most of his life.  Right now he smokes a pack a day but said he would try an ecig if he had one.  I want to buy him one for Christmas and was wondering what you guys think he would like. \u000a\u000a What I am looking for is something that is of quality, not extremely high maintenance, easy enough for a 62 year old "from the old school" to use, the ability to try different flavors might be a benefit, and something that can last the whole day.  I have used some of the smaller juul products and think they are nice but I think something a bit bigger would be nice.  I don't want him sucking some giant robot dick blowing fat clouds like all the bros, just something that will be useful to a heavy smoker to help him smoke less cigarettes.
p522
aVThe Juul, Aspire Breeze, Innokin Endura T20 or Joyetech Penguin/Dolphin
p523
aVI can come over to /r/Juul and waffle incessant irrelevant bollocks all over any post you tell me to chief. 
p524
aVLast week some of "you people" downvoted me for claiming Juul was a temperature Controlled device. I present my case\u000a\u000a
p525
aVPick your dad up a Juul. It is the closest thing I've found that will satisfy the cig. cravings. Simple device that he won't have to spend a lot of time getting used to. If that works for him, in time, he may find interest in refillable tanks and mods. I purchased mods and passed on some of my mods/tanks to my son and DIL (in their 40s). The only thing that worked for them was the JUUL. I'll be 64 next month and cig. free for over 3 yrs. I think it would be a great xmas gift for your dad.
p526
aVGet him a Juul.\u000a\u000aI tried with my dad for a while with Joyetech mods and things of that nature and while he got into it, he hated dealing with burnt coils and shit like that.\u000a\u000aSince he has gotten a Juul, hasn\u2019t touched a cigarette. It\u2019s been about a year and a half now. Anytime anything goes wrong with it, he just sends it in and they send him a new one. Their chat support is great (my dad is partially deaf).\u000a\u000aHe loves it and I love knowing the fact he\u2019ll be in my life longer.
p527
aVLike the above poster and my comment, Juul. Lifetime warranty.
p528
aVI think what gets him is the ease of use. The cartridges, never refilling tanks, the warranty.\u000a\u000aI think the Juul is only like $40?? I\u2019ve noticed older people generally aren\u2019t cloud beasts and want something inconspicuous. Plus comparing an old blu to a Juul with the salts is night and day my friend...
p529
aVThe juul only has one strength 54 mg/ml. Sounds like a lot because... it is, but it produces much less vapor and uses much less juice than normal settups. A pod is .7ml and supposed to = a pack.\u000a\u000aI'd never recommend one to someone who has not previously smoked because a lot if poeple in the frat scene got addicted to them but I've heard from multiple poeple that it is the one vape that could get them off cigs.
p530
aVI see, thank you for the info.  At this point I'm willing to give it a shot.  Having a hard time finding them online...seems breazy has them, as well as the juul website...any idea why that is
p531
aVSorry for just now getting back. The Juul pods only come in one nic level unfortunately. One pod is equal to one pack of cigarettes. So your dad probably go through one half a pod per day. I recommend getting him the starter pack. They sell for $50. on Juuls site. I'm going to guess your dad will probably like the mint flavor. I wish him luck.
p532
aVWell, you can start with a pen device that has a 510 connector, so you could get other tanks to use on it and keep diffferent flavors in them. The Innokin Endura T18 and T20 are fairly popular. I wouldn't recommend an iJust because it's only for direct lung inhaling (that's hitting it like a bong.)\u000a\u000aYou can also go with pod systems. You can't use other tanks with them, but they tend to be smaller and easier to fit into your pocket. Juul / Aspire Breeze / iCare 2 / Atopack Dolpin seem to be decent and fairly popular. I'd stay away from Suorin Airs and Drops, as they appear to have quality control issues. We see a lot of new vapers come here because their Suorin pods unexpectedly died.\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aNicotine salt juices also might help a new vaper transition from smoking.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/7i6fww/alternative_nic_salt_companies\u000a\u000aNicotine salts are absorbed into the body more quickly than regular vaping nicotine. You can get your morning nicotine buzz using salt based devices. If you go with a mouth to lung pod system, a lot of people run those with nicotine salts in high concentrations. I think 24 / 36 / 48 are the normal amounts of nicotine used in them.
p533
aVThe Juul is a simple to learn and seemingly well built pod system. It's not as cheap as some of the refillable ones (pods can be pricy compared to using systems using traditional e-liquid which are often far more complex to learn comparatively, or even refillable ones which seem to be very hit or miss from my research so far), but it works damn well and still cheaper than smoking. There's also a one year warranty that I hear is very good and if any problems arise they generally will make it right in a relatively short period of time from what I've heard. Can't say many other pod systems offer warranties like that (that I know of at least). \u000a\u000aPeople aren't the biggest fan of it compared to a lot of the others because of its popularity and sadly the kids who seem to enjoy it and do dumb shit, but it really helped me recently after I gave in and had a couple cigarettes after a long time not smoking because I was frustrated with some of my complex setups that day and life in general. Now that I own this, it provides the same satisfaction if not more (it doesn't taste like shit like cigarettes do!) and has helped me avoid further temptation. Yeah I may be paying more than I normally like to on vaping (well at least regarding liquid and prebuilt stuff) but it's cheaper and healthier than relapsing on cigarettes.\u000a\u000a50mg nic salts are strong, so 3 puffs or possibly a handful depending on tolerance is really all you need probably. It's best to take it slow and determine when to stop before you get nauseous (like how you would if you chainsmoked a few non filter cigarettes). \u000a\u000aIt's a mouth to lung device though, meaning you inhale it or in lack of better words "smoke" it like you would a cigarette. The draw is very close and so is the throat hit. Direct lung setups (like what you see people doing huge clouds with for example) you inhale similarly to a hookah or bong (hate to use that example but it's one of the few I can think of) and may be weird to transition to if you're used to smoking. \u000a\u000aThe benefit of pod systems like the Juul is it's literally plug a pod in and make sure your battery is charged (in this case a simple tap or two near the top before the pod section will show an LED indicator for battery level) and you're ready to rock and roll. \u000a\u000aAn alternative would be maybe something like an eleaf pico &amp; nautilus 2, which also is going to be similar to a cigarette in how it's inhaled (or in smokers terms, the way you would smoke it) and that would be a solid beginner mod kit with more bells and whistles. It also requires you to know a little bit about what to do and not do with batteries (easy but something you need to be wary of) and you will have to change coils (and buy replacements) as well as wash and maintain the tank. You'd also need to know what to set your wattage at (generally I think its around 15-20w in that tank depending on the coil) and get an external charger as well. \u000a\u000aThe Endura T18 &amp; T20 are always great suggestions as /u/AnTi90d mentioned, those you just need to charge the battery via a usb cable and swap out coilheads and clean the tank. Swapping coils is pretty easy regarding that, Pretty sure it's just opening the tank when it's empty or close ideally or otherwise dump out remaining juice that's in there and screwing a new one in after washing it out i imagine like many other tanks. As far as telling if the coil is dying, you can tell by the flavor decreasing and starting to taste shitty. \u000a\u000aIn terms of ease of use and what I feel would work best, assuming you aren't familiar and comfortable with direct lung a pod system like the Juul or an Endura T18 or T20 would be the cheapest and best bet to give it a shot if you want a draw similar to a cigarette and minimal maintenance and things to learn about in the beginning. I would say the only thing with the juul is you have to be careful to maybe not over do it but you can generally tell when you're cravings are satisfied and nic salts hit faster than the juice you would use in the enduras or any other non nic salt juice. \u000a\u000aRegarding juice, I would say try 9-18mg somewhere in that area with 50/50 vg/pg ratio for the endura, and the Juul has prefilled pods (cartridges essentially) which make it so you don't have to worry about this. If you went with the Juul I think you would like the Mint pods the most. The starter kit comes with 4 flavors (Fruit Medley, Creme Brulee, Mint, and Tobacco) and there's Mango pods and occasionally some limited release flavors also. \u000a\u000aI'd say look into those and see how they work (YouTube can be useful, not so much for the Juul, I would say look at the official website, there's a lot of stupid shit people put up about the Juuls that may turn you off based on the content some idiots upload) and see what thing appeals to you the most and grab one offline or in a store ( vapordna.com, elementvape.com and e-ciggity.com are all vendors I've had positive experiences with and would recommend). \u000a\u000aGood luck and don't feel bad if you dual use for a period of time before completely transitioning, that's how me and my friend both quit smoking (i slipped up a few times but got right back on the wagon) and either way it's less cigarettes smoked than normal and healthier than only smoking. 
p534
aVJuul is a great device for the transition from smoking to vaping but not a long term solution. You can be just as addicted to the Juul as cigarettes, I know because I\u2019ve been there. I was happily vaping 3mg not even needing to vape any longer, then I got a new job in a big city, didn\u2019t want to blow huge clouds anymore, picked up a Juul and it ruined all the progress I made with needing less and less nicotine. \u000aAlso the build quality is absolute shit. Of course Pax just throws another device at you when it breaks or doesn\u2019t hit anymore, all their money comes from keeping you hooked on pods which are absurdly expensive for what they are. 
p535
aVYoure making a GREAT choice! \u000a\u000aThe Juul is a great place to start, easy, peasy, no mess, no fuss. and the menthol hit is fanfuckingtastic. It made it possible for me to quit. 
p536
aVI would start with something like a Juul easy and simple and will give a noticable cigarette style hit. It's a no fuss device to get started on. I went a little too hard to fast when I quit and ended up frustrated I wasn't getting the results I wanted. This led me to smoke for an extra year until I finally started really getting my vaping situation figured out. 
p537
aVI think a Mi-one is a great starter device, additionally, any podmod would be great (I would recommend the Juul personally). \u000a\u000aAlso the Endura's are good, but if you wanna jump straight into direct lung hits, those Smok Stick v8's aren't really bad.\u000a\u000aIf you want something that you can grow into, and looks really nice; A voopoo Drag mod with a Wake Tank, although that's not really a "beginner" device, but if you smoke out of a bong ever it's kinda like that, really airy and open and straight into your lungs. I would suggest the latter (if you're serious about the switch and wanna give it a chance) because nine times out of ten, you'll end up with something similar within a few months of vaping. As far as juice, that's the good part, buy a couple bottles of cheap juice that match a flavor profile that you'd like (you can get around 4 bottles for the price of one bottle if you go onto /r/DIY_classifieds, you cant go wrong with u/hashslingingslashur) get like a fruity, a cream (strawberry and cream is a really beloved profile by many vapers) and maybe a tobacco. That way if you don't happen to love one of them, you can move on to the next one. GOOD LUCK and STICK WITH IT, (it works if you work it xD )
p538
aVI haven\u2019t had any issue with mine but I\u2019ve only had it half a week so who knows. I like it more than the Juul but that\u2019s the only experience with pods I\u2019ve had. 
p539
aVOutside of the refill option (outside of opening and filling a used juul pod) what do you like better about it? I've had a juul for about the same time span as you have had the sourin, but the only con I can find is how expensive pods can be  (I've yet to try to refill any since I have a 2 half used ones and 2 full ones, and 8 coming). \u000a\u000aI was looking for a refillable option and the sourin is up on my list, but the size and shape of it made me look at a few others. \u000a\u000aI'm curious though as to what you found made you prefer it than the Juul, because it may be things I never considered or understimated. 
p540
aV&gt; Boulder Rock deal at Bombies - you get a 30ml bottle with that for $25\u000a\u000aI've considered this in addition to the Juul because worst case I can use the salts to fill a different refillable device or used pods. I wish they did 50mg, but I think 40 would be good enough and the price is nice enough to where there isn't much room to complain. I heard mixed things about the Boulder Rock though, it'd be interesting to hear from anyone who's had long term experience with one.
p541
aVPersonally I get much better hits off my drop. I have to take the stupid pods out of my Juul every 4 hits and shake the bubbles out. My only issue currently is finding Salt Nic juice that\u2019s good. It\u2019s expensive and there\u2019s so few choices/reviews. Solace strawberry hard candy is really good though. If you buy from [vapordna](https://www.vapordna.com/Holiday-Promotion-Suorin-Drop-and-Solace-Bundle-p/hpsula.htm) they have a holiday bundle where if you spend $25 or more you can get the Suorin Drop and the choice of either Solace Strawberry Hard Candy or Solace Mint for $19.99 using coupon code "DROP". That sounds weird but I copied and pasted that last bit from their website cause I\u2019m lazy but it\u2019s how I got mine plus some juice to try. 
p542
aV&gt; I have to take the stupid pods out of my Juul every 4 hits and shake the bubbles out.\u000a\u000aWeird, I've yet to have this issue. I've seen bubbles but the performance on mine is consistent regardless. Could be a bad batch of pods. I'm looking into some nic salts myself (trying to find more at 50mg than Naked's and maybe a few others) so if this kind of thread pops up again and I find some and see you in it I'll try to remember to mention what I've tried. So far I have a fair amount of pods to go through while I find what the best option on the market that's as close to the Juul as I can. Otherwise, I'll buy pods until I find one, for as much hate as it gets, this little thing is everything I hoped it would be.
p543
aVJuul or any old system. I don\u2019t have any experience, but just what I understand from those setups. 
p544
aVAs someone who uses them almost exclusively outside of a recently acquired Juul, there is no benefit. I use mech squonk mods and haven't got the money for the regulated ones I've had my eye on and I'm used to the building and safety aspects from using tubes for a good part of this year. \u000a\u000aOutside of those personal reasons regarding why I use them, there's little reason to get into them unless you do the research enough to where you're confident enough to ask maybe if what you read and learned is correct at the most. Dual battery regulated mods will outperform any single 18650 and pose any risk of venting at the same power levels, and deliver consistent power instead of a slowly decreasing amount as you vape (the time it takes is also dependent on how much power you're asking the battery to deliver). \u000a\u000aPeople who are "serious" vapers are probably people who like to tinker, have the time and know how to do so, and just like the form factor, aesthetics and things like that. They trade off a consistent vape experience (I don't find it that bad, but there's a difference for sure, and some hate it, others like me don't mind it at all), the lack of any safety features besides what's between your ears, and all the other options for those reasons mostly for the reasons I listed prior to this sentence. \u000a\u000aThe only benefits to them is that theoretically they will stand the test of time better **if** maintained properly and maybe if some spare parts are to be had once some things are worn out, besides that they generally look better than any regulated device (subjective) and right now the most of the best options for a $100+ squonk mod are mechanical unless you are willing to shell out the extra it costs for a DNA or Yihi one, and those are almost all single cell and cap at 60-70w. The only dual battery options I've seen are quite costly compared to their single cell cousins. There may be a few cheaper options (Therion 75c BF) but if I'm spending that money already I'd rather get it from a small modder and pay more for a much higher quality device than that (subjective). \u000a\u000aTldr: outside of aesthetics and squonk mods being abundantly common as single cell mechanical mods, there really is no reason to unless you're a hobbyist who is knowledgeable enough to already know the answer to this question. 
p545
aVBest refillable juul size vape?
p546
aVWhat's a good e-cig like the juul?\u000a\u000aI'm not trying to buy the iphone of vapes. I'm looking for something small and portable like the juul with low vapor production but high nicotine content. I'm pretty sure there are cheaper and better options but I'm new to this small portable stuff and don't know much about these vapes or what brands to trust.
p547
aVI have a Limitless Pulse and dig it. It has refillable pods and a similar form factor to the Juul. I use it with 25-45mg nic salt e-liquid. 
p548
aVI second this. Almost as good as a JUUL but way cheaper to operate.
p549
aVI'm interested in finding something as small (well so far I haven't) or even just slightly bigger, metal construction, mtl draw as tight or slightly tighter than the Juul, and refillable. \u000a\u000aI have a Juul, it's not that cheap to buy pods for but with the warranty, reliability is much less of a worry than a lot of other pod systems that seem almost entirely disposable. Outside of the fact they don't make an empty refillable pod for it, I would say it's pretty much what you're looking for. I thought it would be overrated bullshit myself until I got one and I'd be lying if I didn't use it during the day as much as some of my $200+ setups.  There's sales also from time to time based on region, but you seem against it from the start and they don't pay me to sell it so I'm no salesman trying to convince you. It's popular because it works well and has a good warranty to back it up. It's a shame it's so popular with kids and those barely above age who act like kids still, because it'd be a great thing for smokers (or those tempted to go back) to use as a tool. That all being said, I'm on the market myself for something that's pretty much identical (or as identical as we can get, and yes that's shape and weight also), so I'm curious as to what you can find.
p550
aVDo you have a juul for comparison? How is the draw? The juul has a near perfect draw to me and a lot of other pod systems disappointed (myjet, icare). 
p551
aVYes I do. The Boulder Rock is a bit airier, but I find if I cover one side of the pod/airflow it cuts it down to just a touch looser than a JUUL. 
p552
aVDepends on what nicotine level you are vaping at I would say. Here is a quick run down of why:\u000a\u000aIf you have already brought your nicotine intake to lets say 6 mg(freebase), and find that you are satisfied and don't have active cravings I would stick to what you already have going. \u000a\u000aIf you are at 6mg ( freebase ) but find yourself relapsing more often than not to traditional tobacco, I would go for it. Nicotine salts allows the user to be able to vape higher concentrations of nicotine while maintaining subohm free base throat hit levels. That being said, NS also hits your system faster but has a shorter half life. So if it is the nicotine buzz you are chasing after then this is the route to go. NS is recommended to be used in MTL set ups with lower wattage and/or pod mods ( Juul, Bo, iCare, Mi-One). \u000a\u000aThere is a trend of DTL vapers who are now going back to MTL and starting to use NS, but this comes with a catch. You will be upping your nicotine levels again, if you are at a 6mg or a 3mg freebase, it is going to feel like you are vaping on air if you use the same mg NicSalts. Nicotine salts are a amazing way to convert newer vapers from traditional cigarettes. It is for those people who the 24mg on a freebase MTL set up is too harsh but they also find themselves still smoking because it doesn't feel " enough ". \u000a\u000aAlthough I will say having a small stealth MTL mod with some nic salts thrown in to it handy for times like travel, work ( limited breaks etc ) !! \u000a\u000aHope that helps answer some of your questions, let me know if I can clarify anything else. 
p553
aVThe rule of thumb is whatever strength NS you have is going to feel like  the equivalent throat hit of half that strength in freebase. NS juice that's readily available is for the most part manufactureed for pod and MTL systems since it was the journey of replicating the JUUL pods (55mg NS) that initially brought NS mainstream. That is why NS juices are not recommended to be used in sub ohm devices. \u000a\u000aNS has a much smoother throat hit. The reason you're getting the buzz is not because of throat hit but rather  high nic and NS hits your system faster than freebase. If you're looking to make your own I would suggest sticking to about 10-12mg NS to achieve the throat hit of 6mg freebase.
p554
aVAlthough not even close to the least expensive, I would recommend the Juul due to the simplicity, the high nic content (soothes cravings well) and a couple of people I met irl managed to quit smoking with them pretty painlessly
p555
aVI may be wrong, but I thought you get 5 pods filled with each of the available flavors when you buy the Juul. 
p556
aVI'd second the Juul. There seems to be two stages to vaping, the first stage is where you want to replicate the experience of a cigarette so you can finally quit smoking, then once you're off cigarettes there's the more fun stage where you begin to discover the different types of vaping, the enormous selection of juices and hardware. The Juul really shines in that first stage because it gives you the closest experience to a real cigarette, which is what most people want when they first quit smoking. \u000a\u000aIn terms of the Juul juice pods, the mango one seems to be the most popular but many of my friends love the tobacco and menthol ones too. Best thing to do is to order the Juul starter kit and see which flavors you like the most, then order more pods.\u000a\u000aThere's an upfront investment when you enter the realm of vaping but in the long run it saves you a crazy amount of money. When you go deeper down the rabbit hole it becomes even cheaper when you start making your own e-juice and using rebuildable tanks. But there's no rush, one step at a time. Vaping is fun.

aVJuul vs Aspire breeze vs ? For a social smoker\u000a\u000aI\u2019m new to vaping/electronic cigarettes but I was looking for something to use during social settings (twice a week or so for a couple hours at a time). \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI was looking for something simple and low maintenance. After searching around here it seems the Juul or Aspire Breeze were the two I narrowed it down to, although I\u2019m open to anything else as well. I was wondering what you recommended? 
p559
aVThe breeze for so many reasons, namely your going to make yourself sick with the level of nic in juul pods.
p560
aVDoes Juul need its own kind of juice?\u000a\u000a
p561
aVWhat do you mean make yourself sick with the juul pods? 
p562
aVThe juul pods have something like 50mg of nic salt juice in them and you absorb the nic very quickly. If you\u2019re only a casual smoker and you start hitting this thing hard after a week without any nicotine you may get nausea and feel like shit.  
p563
aVim probably gonna get downvoted into oblivion.... but if your just using it for the fuck of it try a smok stick v8 big baby beast. its something like $25 and you can use 3mg nic when you want nicotine and 0mg when you want to throw crazy cloud without getting addicted. a little more maintainance than a juul but you'll have less chances of getting brutally addicted to nic.
p564
aVIf you're not a smoker don't touch it. For reference I managed to quit a 19 year pack a day habit on 18mg/ml liquid. The liquid in Juul pods is 59mg/ml. While there's some evidence that nicotine taken in isolation isn't as addictive as when combined with all the other shite that's in cigarettes, that's strong stuff to be fucking around with. There's no point risking developing a  nicotine addiction if you don't currently have one.
p565
aVRegular juul use is more expensive than smoking in my city...still see every basic bitch walking down the street with one 
p566
aVI'd go with the Breeze, social or not. You'll go crazy searching stores for Juul kids. Breeze is great for controlling nicotine levels, using virtually any juice you want, and being discreet. Battery level is all day. I went from a 50 w istick mod vaping all day 6 mg nicotine. Bought the breeze for discrete use as I'm a Realtor and didn't want a heavy mod. Travelling through South America with it now and it doesn't weigh me down or anything. And the draw on the breeze is so easily controllable. You can take a mouth to lung hit by covering the airhole or straight to lung. Dude, def go with the breeze. Any vape shop will be friendly to your needs. Juuls I heard are decent but you have to use only their products.
p567
aV7 icare coils.  Always spitty.  I think it\u2019s just a design flaw.  \u000a\u000aI\u2019m still on my first Suorin Pod purchased on Black Friday and I think it\u2019s just the nature of these types of Pods.  Even the myjet had wick density issue, most were over stuffed with cotton.\u000a\u000aBut the experience has been pretty solid.  I\u2019ve been using Juul and Bo.  Between the two I\u2019ve found the Bo to be very consistent, but it got expensive.
p568
aVCould be a Juul or something. But without knowing exactly what it is, there's no advice to give. 
p569
aVThat's a wide range of flavors.. and you have a menthol tobacco. I smoked M Menthol for 20 years, so when I try a new vendor's juice I always go for the menthol, first.. although none of the ones I've tried ever seem to have enough menthol, even when billed as a strong menthol.\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aIf you're trying to increase your visibility, you might consider adding yourself to the Xmas/NewYear sale megathread.. along with a sale.  https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/7i7oc8/vendorsplease_submit_your_christmasnew_years_sale\u000a\u000aA giveaway here and there will also help people to realize that you exist.\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aYou should really spend a few hours adding yourself to the Juice DB: https://www.juicedb.com That's where a lot of people go to shop for juice by reading reviews and looking at their sales page. It's tedious work, but it's one of the things that differentiates large scale vendors from mom &amp; pop shops.\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aAlso, salt nicotine popularity is on the rise. People like high nicotine content salt liquids to use in pocket kits like iCares / Juuls / Aspire Breezes / Suorin "poor QC" Drops. They're mostly for a few short pulls while at work or on the go, when you don't want to rip clouds but still need a nicotine fix. Crafting a handful of salt liquids will put you on some people's radar that wouldn't otherwise bother with you.\u000a\u000a

aVI think the problem that you're going to have is that not a lot of places even keep those in stock anymore. You might end up having to "upgrade" to one of the all-in-one systems that are more common now, like the juul.
p572
aVBe 18 first. You sure you meet that requirement? Why else would a non smoker want to "enter the vape world". It doesn't impress the high school chicks, they think it's douchey. It might impress the juul bros in the bathroom. Or the overweight duck dynasty bearded guys with shitty faded tattoos who you see at gamestop when you wait in line for the newest FPS.
p573
aVMost of the Juul or Suorin questions are asked by the underaged. It's just a matter of finding the evidence.
p574
aVokay cool thank you so much.  yeah i bought a JUUL last week, and after spending $75 on pods with inconsistent hits threw it in trash i bought warlock 2 days ago, and been through 2 pods.  how do i open it?
p575
aVDoes anyone have any recommendations for a good mtl starter kit? My wife has been using the Smok stick v8 baby to try to quit smoking but she is still smoking cigs more than her vape. Ii don\u2019t think dtl is working for her right now. \u2019m thinking not might be a better way for her to quit. I\u2019ve been looking at the bolder rock and the Juul. I\u2019m looking for something with an internal battery and is easy to use for beginners. Hoping to have her off cigs completely sometime next year.
p576
aVThey are still around. One popular example is the JUUL.
p577
aVYou'd be happier with a Juul / Aspire Breeze / iCare 2 or some other pod system. They all use pressure sensors to start the vape when you draw on the mouth piece.
p578
aVQuick question about nic content\u000a\u000aSo I just got the Rubi by kandypens (which has actually been pretty great tbh), but I was wondering about the nic content of the juice I use. Ik the juul has a content of around 59 mg/ml, but mine has about 45 mg/ml. Now, this shouldn't be a problem except for it burns easier and I get much more smoke than with juul. Just making sure this like isn't severely unhealthy, and if I should stop. Serious responses only please, I'm just making sure I'm being careful :)
p579
aVBeen vaping nearly the same way for 3 years - looking for opinions on Nic Salts, Juul-like devices, and the seemingly total reversal of vaping trends\u000a\u000a**tldr; eGo pen-style 18mg --&gt; Subtank Mini 12mg --&gt; down to Serpent Mini 20w 3mg. Basically ended up vaping all day and never feeling the nicotine. Started doing nasal snuff (and occasional nicotine gum) to, ironically, cut down on vaping 3mg - should I get a nic salt device?**\u000a\u000aHello all, so as the title states, I've been vaping for about 3 years now. I smoked cigs (between 4 to 10 a day) and dipped for years, then switched to vaping with an eGo, a Kanger Mini Protank 3, and 18mg juice I believe. At the time, my cardio was shitty, and I was breathing pretty poorly, so my goal was to lower my nicotine content and eventually quit. I bought a Subtank Mini and iStick 30w the first week it came out and it was light years better than my eGo - I could actually feel a buzz from it, unlike the underpowered, low voltage eGo, and it was great - I completely dropped the analogs. \u000a\u000aOver the past several years, I've used similar style tanks (currently vape MTL on a Serpent Mini at ~20w) and gone down in nicotine (slowly), and now I've been at 3mg for a while, but it's become a habit where I constantly chief on the thing and never get a buzz. My fiancee will hit my vape in the car a few times and go "even I don't get a buzz from this thing, and I have zero nicotine tolerance". I got into nasal snuff a few months ago after researching it extensively and finding it to be relatively harmless, and I enjoy it - it gives me a quick little nicotine hit, which vaping hasn't done in years since I've dropped the mg's.\u000a\u000aGiven that I'm not looking to entirely cut nicotine out of my life, what do you all think of the rise of low powered devices and high-nicotine nic salts? I only go through like 3, 4ml max per day if I'm working from home and vaping, but it makes my lungs feel heavy and it affects my breathing - would going to a juul-like device give me an actual nicotine hit with less physical vapor in my lungs / without wanting to drag on the thing 50 times in a row? Are there any rebuildable, small devices good for nic salts? I'm basically just wondering who here has lowered their nicotine level only to find they were upping their frequency, and then went to a nic salt device...\u000a\u000aI'm about out of juice and am debating what to do... I'm not going to order more 3mg juice. It's pointless - I chief it out of habit and because I enjoy the taste, but it makes my lungs feel heavy, and so to get a nicotine boost I either take a pinch of snuff or chew nicotine gum, both of which, subjectively, have far fewer negative health detriments to MY body at least (breathing-wise - if I'm drinking and vaping a lot on a weekend, I feel terrible on monday). Do I order a little Juul-like device and Nic Salt juice and try it out? Order some 6 or 12mg juice? Or do I thank vaping for getting me off cigs and just chew nicotine gum and sniff this enjoyable tobacco dirt up my nostrils instead? 
p580
aVFrom what you have wrote it seems that you have nicotine tolerance(in dumb terms; you\u2019re used to the nicotine) you can see what will work for you if it is raising your nicotine level or even quitting everything for a couple days so you can break your tolerance, and get a buzz back. Don\u2019t use nicotine salts in sub-ohm devices btw. I\ufe0f like the juul a ton, nice compact, and it\u2019ll get you satisfied.
p581
aVI am always on the lookout for small devices that pack some punch - good for quick hits at work, between flights, etc.\u000a\u000aI used Juul for a good year and a half but their QC is awful. They seem to have thinned out the liquid and cheaped out on flavors as they have all seemed to change in the last year and the pods burn through much faster, if they work at all.\u000a\u000aI just picked up a Suorin Air and love it so far. I have some nic salt 35mg (NKD 100) arriving today. It has 2ml refillable pods and hits really nicely so far.\u000a\u000aI've also tried the Phix, Envii Fit, and iCare at various times and neither really did the trick. The Phix pods had good flavor but so much spitback I had to blow through the pod to clear juice every so often. The original iCare was just not good and dry hit constantly. The Fit definitely came the closest, but the refillable pods weren't available at the time.
p582
aVI have a good disposable pod system similar to Juul I want to sell
p583
aVWhich pod do you recommend?\u000a\u000aI'm not sure which is the best between ( Juul, pulse, phix, my jet, mi pod). How long does the pod last?\u000aAny response would be appreciated, thank you!
p584
aVIf you're worried about cost, get a suorin air or suorin drop. Look up "Pbusardo suorin drop" on YouTube for a good review. If you don't mind spending the money on pods, then get a Juul. The Juul is far and beyond the best pod system, he's just the cost of the pods that's a little over the top.
p585
aVIt depends on the pod mod, but they're usually 2ml or lower. Specifically 1.2ml-1.8ml. How long it lasts depends on nicotine content. A 50mg (if I recall the amounts correctly) of nic salts should last a day or more. 18mg of standard nicotine in such a pod wouldn't last as long obviously.\u000a\u000aSome pod mods such as the Juul have pods which are supposed to be thrown away after you empty the liquid. Other pod mods have pods that are meant to be refillable and thrown away only once the coil goes bad. Again others only require you to replace the coil and the pod is reusable.\u000a\u000aI personally think all pod mods are easily broken or just don't last that long. Flavor or the tightness of the draw can vary but in terms of quality they're all more or less expendable items. Therefore, I don't recommend spending more than $15 on a pod mod as I believe you just sink money into them with maybe the joyetech pod mods being a bit of an exception.\u000a\u000aOther than the joyetech penguin or dolphin they all have poor liquid capacity, and poor battery capacity. Granted the joyetech pod mods are much bigger and don't resemble cigarettes or cigars.\u000a\u000aIf I was going to buy one it'd be the Eleaf iCare2 or Rofvape Warlock Peas. That's just my 2 cents.
p586
aVI have not tried the Breeze yet, or the new dolphin from Joyetech. Penguin is definitely DTL to me. Nicotine salt on mech mod? I thought it was just for pod systems like Juul or Bo.
p587
aVHell, a lot of the guys I knew back in high school didn't even vape nicotine, just 100% VG juice for "maximum clouds."\u000a\u000aApparently juuls are the new big thing, though, so there goes that argument. 
p588
aVComing from a 19 year old, vaping hit my school hard. In my late junior and senior year tons of people had vapes or they had a juul. They would always be hitting them in the bathrooms sometimes in class. I myself have a vape but I don\u2019t do it because it\u2019s in, personally I do it so I don\u2019t actually smoke cigs as I did start smoking but quickly went off and got a vape.
p589
aVAlso had quite a dream, woke up craving a MTL hit from a JUUL (no idea why) then used my Crown III and got over it before the meeting I had to take a shit during. Noises and all, sir.
p590
aVSub Ohm 60mg nic salts/Benzoic Acid\u000a\u000aSo, recently I picked up a target mini mod because I left my juul multiple states away. I am also getting sick of it's high cost and how often I lose it due to its size and low profile, plus it slips out of my pockets when I sit down. I also was compelled by the idea of sub-ohming high strength nic salts at a low wattage, as I assumed the buzz would be stronger and about 50x cheaper. \u000a\u000aAt first, I was somewhat nervous, thinking it could be dangerous, but I filled up the tank with some naked 100 lava flow 50 mg nic salt juice, took some puffs, and was surprisingly very underwhelmed. It's nice, don't get me wrong, and it staves off cravings, but it's not the monumental dome I thought it would be, and honestly, it's even less substantial than most pod mods that use similar juice. I'm very confused now, as even though I have a high nicotine tolerance, I don't understand the reasoning for all the warning labels to not sub ohm nic salts. \u000a\u000aI was considering now, the reasons for the underwhelming effects, and I feel like I may have just bought a poor salt brand, as I was unaware naked 100 made salt juice now and have only heard praise for companies like Mr. Salt E and LevelUp. I have decided to try and empty a couple of spare juul pods into the tank, and to potentially order beyondthepod juice, which has 60mg nicotine by weight and added benzoic acid, the same formula as juul juice. However, I've read that benzoic acid decomposing into benzene is a new topic of concern, but it has only been refuted on high ohm, low watt mods. I now wonder if that it's not the high nicotine content for the warnings, but instead the juice decomposing into unsavory chemicals at higher temperatures, and this concerns me much more.\u000a\u000aFor you nicotine chemists out there, do you think what I am proposing to do safe? Or what I have been doing for that matter? I have been hitting this juice between 20 and 35 watts and would plan to do the same with the other juices.

aVI've been thinking about getting a juul.\u000a  \u000aI've got a few mods and several tanks, and I think I am at a point where vaping feels more like a chore than something I am super excited about. 
p593
aVthe phix it's a bigger battery, bigger pod version of the juul.
p594
aVI wish more schools would start cracking down this hard. Although this kid was 18, the underage vapers are threatening the industry for the rest of us. Like every other high schooler has a Juul now. Most of Juul's revenue probably comes from underage users.
p595
aVWhen is it the schools place to police kids. First step should be the parents or guardians of the kids.  My parents knew exactly what I was doing and when I was doing it when I was a kid.\u000a\u000aNext stop should be the gas stations selling the oh so popular juuls to kids. 
p596
aVMTL Setups other than MTL devices?\u000a\u000aBesides iCares, Juuls, myJet, Suorin and whatnot, what are other MTL builds that can handle 36mg of salt nic? I've seen single coil RDA setups and some using subohm tanks used in very low wattages. How does flavor compare to the usual devices used for MTL, like the ones listed above?\u000a\u000aI don't really care about the vapor production for this one, just a good throat hit and flavor delivery.
p597
aVTry a juul or something similar. It could be the throat hit you\u2019re missing

aVNever heard of juul, seems like anew type of vape?

aVWholesale Juul Pods?\u000a\u000aAnyone know where to find them? I was told they are available for $4/pack. Of course the guy who told me doesn't want competition as he is a retailer, but he said "Juul does not make Juul pods" as a hint. I've been looking for hours but I can't seem to get anywhere. Anyone know anything about this? 
p600
aVThe fact you\u2019ve now reached the stage where the cost of Juul pods is a problem means you\u2019ve reached the stage where refilling is a more cost effective option, and trying to source pods at wholesale is just deferring the inevitable.

I'm thinking the high nicotine salts are probably the best bet for them. Simplicity might be key here because I'm sure they aren't going to be building coils and shopping for new flavors etc (at least not initially).\u000a\u000aI'm trying to spend $100-$200 on the kit + cartridges to last them a good while.\u000a\u000aThanks in advance!
p602
aVProbably the Juul itself. Have a look around - there's $1 Juul starter kits knocking around in Circle K gas stations - my mate got one in the Chicago burbs the other day - which would obvs add to your pod budget. 
p603
aVI got one from juul directly as part of some NYC promotion. Deals come and go. Surely they'll come again
p604
aVPersonally I\u2019d buy him 2-3 Aspire Breezes, a variety of Nic salt juice, and some coils. It\u2019s $20 or so, built well, and works great. Coils last a long time and are extremely easy to replace. And that way if he loses or breaks one you don\u2019t have to buy a new expensive Juul. 
p605
aVBest juul alternative?\u000a\u000a[deleted]
p606
aVDo any other closed salt systems use a set temp control like juul?\u000a\u000aA few years later and all these attempts at "juul killers", has anyone ever created a csv device that uses TC to actually compete with a juul?
p607
aVHuh? Since when does a Juul have temp control?
p608
aVI dont feel like digging. it's common knowledge. \u000a\u000aDoes your juul shut off when your pod is dry? 
p609
aVIt doesn\u2019t, no. Every Juul I\u2019ve had will continue to fire if you use it, even if the pod is dry. I\u2019ve had many pods burn out on me when using it, especially the creme brle pods. And they weren\u2019t even dry. This has happened with my Juul and my friends and coworkers Juuls. If it does use a fork of temp control it doesn\u2019t work very well at all\u2019s \u000a\u000aIt\u2019s certainly not common knowledge though if this is true. With that said, I\u2019ll do some digging for you and see what I come up with. 
p610
aVInteresting, they claim they use a temperature regulating technology to keep an optimal vaporizing experience so there is no combustion. Personally, I believe this is less temp control as we know it in modern devices as it is a fixed temperature that they keep it at. I\u2019ve used the Juul extensively when it came out and I\u2019ve never experienced anything close to temperature regulating technology. I\u2019ve had many burnt pods before the pods even dry. If they are using any sort of modern temp control in the device, it is very inaccurate and really doesn\u2019t work well in my experience. \u000a\u000aI guess the answer to ops question would be most likely no, there aren\u2019t any devices that use the same technology as the Juul, but devices such as the Phix would definitely be an improvement to  and an upgrade from the Juul. 
p611
aVI'll bet that it just detects the volume of air being pulled through the device and then adjust the power applied accordingly. \u000a\u000aThe JUUL pods use nichrome wire which has an extremely low TCR value and detecting the minuscule fluctuations in the resistance is still impossible for most modern mods. 
p612
aVStrange, TC would avert burnt coils, yet every Juuler has experienced those.

aVHow are you guys burning juul pods that use silica wick and temp control? I've Vaped through dozens of juul pods and never burnt a pod.
p615
aVAlready found it on their site. I\u2019m skeptical since I\u2019ve never experienced anything even close to temp control with the Juul. It might be set to an ideal temperature in the device but I doubt it\u2019s actually temperature sensing or using temperature control/protection. 
p616
aVlol right?\u000a\u000aI have maybe had 2 burn hits on a juul pod in my nicotine career. \u000a\u000aI switch out pods when they are no longer hitting. These kids yelling they get dry hits all day \u000a

aVJuul Question\u000a\u000aI'm starting this as saying I'm new to vaping and have only been doing it four months. I did it to quit an extreme smoking/dipping habit. \u000a\u000aAnyways I was reading up on Juuls as I'm looking for a cheap backup if my primary fails. I read the cartridges can be refilled with nicotine salt based fluids. That means I can't use standard ejuice correct? If so what would that mean I need to refill and where would I find it? I got my fist unit (Aspire K2) half ass working, but I wouldn't rely on it and I would like a cheap replacement unit if something where to ever go wrong to prevent myself from returning to smokes. \u000a\u000aAside from the questions I already asked about Juul, are there any recommendations on a cheap unit to have around as backup? I have a tendency to fall asleep with my vape in my hands and wake up suddenly and drop it. Haven't done that in the couple of months of having my new system but it will happen eventually. Any thoughts? I know you guys hate questions like this, but I don't know what to do and any help would be appreciated. \u000a\u000aThanks guys!\u000a\u000aEdit: If you have another suggestion for a system please let me know if it will work with my normal juice. I'm doing research on suggestions given, but not finding the answers.
p618
aVThere's loads of cheap units and after a month of reading this sub I'm almost overloaded with all the gear. Mostly it seems to depend on how you like to draw on your vape (Mouth To Lung) MTL or (Direct To Lung) DTL.\u000a\u000aThat said, my first vape from a BM (Brick and Mortar store) was an aspire PockeX. I still love it for it's simplicity and maybe because she got me off the ciggies. I bought a replacement for 11$ somewhere off the Internet.  I saw last night a juul look alike called Boulder (Google "Boulder vape"). $10. Refillable. \u000a\u000aBottom line: save money and don't do pods. Refill your own or save thousands and jump in on the DIY ejuice. Sometimes the flavor isn't the best in the beginning but it's always going to be long run cheaper than buying juice and short run cheaper than any pod style vape. 
p619
aVAspire breeze seems to get good reveiws and be eelativiely cheap. Id 100% recomend it over a juul. 
p620
aVI jut lost my job so I can't afford and to get into DIY yet. I will be doing that once income resumes. \u000a\u000aI read that you can refill Juul pods, but not knowing anything about them I could have misread that, or not understood what it was saying. \u000a\u000aSince I break stuff (I'm a klutz) I got a lifetime warranty on my primary from a B&amp;M, but it could take them a couple of days to repair and place. I'm sure my rebuilt K2 would last that long, but I'd rather be safe than sorry hence looking at the cheapest possible, most satisfying entry unit I can.\u000a\u000aI'll check out the boulder vape. I've tried the Camel and Marlboro closed system products and after having a DTM system I don't want to go back to that. Obviously the K2 isn't one, but it will satiate my need for nic until I get something fixed. Typically I don't do warranties, but as I dropped my K2 in an ambien induced haze I accepted the realist of doing the same thing with a much more expensive system although it hasn't happened yet. 
p621
aVHonestly I never even used a juul so I actually don't know if they can be refilled. Sorry to hear about the cash flow. But for sure the biggest cost in vaping will be the ejuice. The sooner you get in on that game, the more you'll save. I bet you could get started with $30 upfront bare minimum and spend the money you would on juice on adding slowly. I get that money's tight. Definitely keep reading and consider it. Basically buy pg/vg/nic, a few flavors to start and some took to measure and you can be set for a few months easy. Hopefully someone more knowledgeable will respond. 
p622
aVI have a juul, you're only going to save money if you refill the pods, depending on what flavor you like, it is a good enough option.\u000a\u000aProblem is that the battery costs 35 bucks and then pod replacements cost 15-20$ for 4 pods, with ejuice inside. You can't really change the menthol flavored pods to fruit flavors (already tried) because the menthol sticks around (or mint, whatever, the green ones.)\u000a\u000aI just picked up a Warlock Peas, roughly the same size unit, charges in a MUCH better way (juul uses a magnet to clamp against a charge pad, was constantly picking up metal shavings at work for me, led to intermittent charging issues. The pea plugs into a standard USB port, and I like that.) You get replacement pods in a 5 pack, for 10ish bucks on the internet. The battery costs 15 bucks (cheaper if you wanna get a knockoff or whatever).\u000a\u000aBut, I like it almost as much as I liked the Juul. My only problem with it is there's no easy way to tell while fumbling it out of your pocket which end to suck on. Since I'm constantly tossing it in my shirt pocket, it falls to the side, and when I dig it out I literally gotta look at my hand to tell. If that matters, skip the warlock pea lol.
p623
aVDepends what nicotine strengths you have. To get the juul effect you need 50mg salt nic or 18mg non salt nic. But I would suggest the salt nic for best results.
p624
aVIts signifigantly cheaper than a juul, especially since pods cost so much. 
p625
aVAlternatives to refilling JUUL pod that won\u2019t give me a throat hit?\u000a\u000aHey! I had bought a Volt E-cig due to portability, and I wanted to step it up, so I went down to my local smoke shop and bought a JUUL. While it\u2019s amazing, considering I\u2019ve never smoked before, I get a REALLY strong throat hit that I\u2019m not comfortable with. I plan on refilling the pods myself once I run out with something \u201csofter\u201d. Any recommendations? 
p626
aVIf you've never smoked before, jumping into 59mg/ml nicotine is gonna hurt. Literally anything short of a knife in the throat is going to give less throat hit than a Juul. Why nicotine if you're not currently addicted to it?
p627
aVYeah it was intense. As for nicotine consumption: when I first bought my Volt cig, I stupidly picked the atomizer with nicotine. Since I had already used nicotine, I didn\u2019t feel so scared to move up with JUUL, but I didn\u2019t know it was such a big jump. I seriously should\u2019ve done more research. 
p628
aVAre there any known dangers of silica wicks? Saw the thread a few days ago about ceramic coils and was wondering what people thought about the juul 
p629
aVLooking to get into vaping, just for fun. I'm the type of person who buys gum not for the flavor but to blow bubbles. the type of person to learn skateboarding for tricks, not for quick transportation. \u000a\u000aSo where do I start? I don't care about the flavor, but I was smoking a cigar with a buddy and we were trying to do smoke tricks. I'd love to do it more but cigars are awful for you, so perhaps I could get a Vape with no nicotine or flavoring?\u000a\u000aWhat brand should I start with? What juice do I buy that has no nicotine or flavoring? As you can imagine, I'm unfamiliar with brands and parts of vape. I've only taken hits off my friend's juul and phix before.
p630
aVSo-Urine-Air strikes again! There have been so many posts on these devices going south, in the last month, or so. I don't know of any nic salt pod devices that are any better. The Juul isn't great, either. I've had a Pax One for a few years, and it's still kicking (same manufacturer as the Juul). So, it must be the design of salt nic mods that is the problem. Have you considered just getting a regular e-juice mod?
p631
aVAll of these high airflow devices you guys reccomend ive tried, they do not hit the spot for me like the juul or suorin (when it worked)
p632
aVGet an Innokin Endura T22 kit. Fill it with 30 or 45mg salt liquid. It\u2019s a restricted airflow setup, runs at 14W, and works great. \u000a\u000aI have Juuls and a Sourin, so I know where you\u2019re coming from. The setup I just described is rock solid. Might be a little much, airflow wise,  but you can drop the nic slightly to offset that. \u000a
p633
aVThe thing is i dont care how big of a hit i get, i literally cannot get nic sick and i dont feel "harshness" from nicotine. the more the merrier. i can smoke 2 packs back to back, not trying to brag obviously just trying to show you how high my tolerance is. But if the airflow isnt tight like a cig it feels off. the suorin and juul hit *perfect* but ill probably go to the vape shop and try it out if they have it
p634
aVNobody hates salt liquid. Everyone agrees that it's an excellent option for smokers looking to quit. Favorites of this sub such as Bombies and Level Up make it. There may be a bit of a resentment growing towards these systems solely based on the amount of 15YOs coming thru here asking 'is Juul or Suorin best for getting buzzed and where can I hide it from my parents' but nobody is going to tell a quitting smoker other than to go with what works for them.
p635
aV&gt; There may be a bit of a resentment growing towards these systems solely based on the amount of 15YOs coming thru here...\u000a\u000aThis. \u000a\u000aYou should see the shit I have to remove in /r/juul. Place is riddled with kids posting asinine crap. 
p636
aVYa that makes sense. I was just feeling around for something like the suorin or juul bc you guys know all the new stuff and half the people are trying to sell me on a regular vape that i can guarantee i know more about than them, again not bragging it was just my hobby for so long. Pair all of this with deeply craving nicotine and sheeit
p637
aVYa but think about it. I started smoking at 16. So did all my friends. If there were juuls out then, i can guarantee we would have never picked up cigs. So ya its annoying how the jits buy em and illegal and bad for them but its better than cigs
p638
aVTrust me, I've considered this as well. I think a decade or two from now, we (as a society) will look back and recognize this revolution for what it is. Not just smokers finding a way to quit without quitting. But a generation of stupid kids being stupid in a *much* healthier way. \u000a\u000aBack in the day\u2014when *I* was a stupid kid\u2014it was burning tobacco that I got myself hooked on. The teenagers now have one massive consequence they don't have to worry about.\u000a\u000aThat said, I still don't like underage users on the sub. For one, they're just plain annoying. Useful posts and interesting content gets drowned out by inane pics of pods, or what they just scratched into their Juul during free study period.\u000a\u000aSecondly, there's a difference between being thankful they have a less hazardous outlet for their experimenting, and encouraging it. 
p639
aVThat's a way more balanced and thoughtful approach than I'd have managed. I'd be threatening people with actual physical violence upon mention of the word 'juuling'. BRB, have to go punch myself in the face for writing that now.\u000a\u000aEDIT - ouch.
p640
aVbruh u need to chill-n-juul for a bit. ur all worked up lmao \U0001f602\U0001f602\U0001f602
p641
aVWell the Juul wont leave me high and dry i just have to get taxed by the pods. some of these other new MTL thanks everyone has been suggesting look good though.\u000a\u000aHave you ever smoke a newport? 
p642
aVJuul?
p643
aVI was going to start her out on the juul but I went to al85 smoking way less than her and thought the transition would be the same\u000a
p644
aV&gt; Has anybody else experienced this?  ....or doing something seriously wrong when I prime?\u000a\u000aMan, the iCare *was* great when it first came out.  With each subsequent re-order I received, the quality greatly worsened to the point where even looking at the iCare would shatter the built-in glass tank.  I decided to stop carrying the iCare because of the issues you mentioned.\u000a\u000aThen I brought in the Boulder Rock.  It's still a pretty damn good device for nicotine salts, but as you mentioned, the pull and flavor could be better.  I think this has to be from the silica wick, you're just going to get that much better flavor from cotton since it is more absorbent than silica.  The Boulder Rock does solve the QA issues and also fixed the iCare's issues of constant leaking and breakage.\u000a\u000aI almost picked up the Suorin Air, before deciding to go the distance with the Kimsun Slim.  In my humble opinion, the Suorin Air is great as a novelty, but I feel the hit it gives is severly underpowered and the credit card shape feels unnatural in the hand when vaping.\u000a\u000aNow the Kimsun Slim 2R.  It's different than anything I've ever tried.  I think it's because it's the first refillable disposable pod system that uses temperature control titanium wire instead of wattage and kanthal.  The first 15-30 pulls is just pure cotton taste, and because it's not silica wick like the Juul or Boulder Rock, the burn in is longer than any other ultraportable you may have used.  Here are two tips I do to make the Kimsun better:\u000a\u000a* The pods come with two clear rubber stoppers that plug the mouthpiece and airhole.  I cut the airhole plug in half, and put it back in, to decrease the draw and increase the flavor.\u000a\u000a* Remove the two stickers on the side of the Kimsun to see your juice level better\u000a\u000a\u000aAs of right now, I think the Kimsun is the best device on the market to use to Max VG nicotine *and* 50/50 nicotine salts.  Is it perfect?  No, but we're getting there.  If and when I can find a device that provides superior flavor to the Kimsun, you bet I will carry it in the store.  \u000a\u000a\u000aLet me know what you think --
p645
aVI've owned at least a dozen different devices over the past ~3 years. Everything from mech mods, VW devices, a Juul, and cigalikes. \u000a\u000aI've been cig-free for the longest amount of time recently, almost a month and a half, because of the iCare 2. I absolutely adore this device. Is it as great as a mech mod? No, hell no. Is it convenient? YES! The coils last a good amount of time if you use 50/50 juice. The cloud production is satisfying. I run Nic salt on it and it's great. I'm actually picking up a second one this week along with one for my Dad for Christmas. \u000a\u000acheers

aVHey Bombies!! I just purchased three After Dark flavors after switching to the Suorin Drop only a week ago and I\u2019m beyond excited to try them! \u000a\u000aUnfortunately, I am not running into the same smooth experience with my device itself. After testing various juices that I could quickly find locally, I seem to be stuck with the same issue of burning the cotton too quickly in my pods. \u000a\u000aI only switched to a mod after tiring from the Juul and its issues, and I was really hoping my solution to my troubleshooting with the Drop was just finding the right juice. \u000a\u000aI\u2019m awaiting my Bombies package to arrive, but since I managed to catch this post I was wondering if you could please advise a pod mod that I could try and snag before my juice comes? I\u2019d love to get a reliable set up working and if the Kimsun is the answer I\u2019d buy right away. I\u2019d really appreciate some insight!! Thank you.
p647
aVwhat is the best miniature device prefill cartridges or not\u000a\u000aShould I get a Juul? I haven't looked into them because of their association with teenagers using them. All i care about is flavor and a very minimal dose of nicotine, 3mg or less equivalent, and simplicity and a small form factor.\u000a\u000aI have a setup i love with an istick mini and an itaste vv but i know it's stuck in the past and improvements have been made..... That said if there's anything that fits on that miniature form factor I'm interested. I have two Kayfun mini v3's and a HH 357 i use on the istick mini. Generally don't use the itaste vv anymore.\u000a\u000a\u000aWas in love with my crown 3 setup but it was too bulky i decided. I like the miniature or pen form factor. I have been using the istick mini basically nonstop.
p648
aVI'd only get the Rofvape Warlock Peas or Icare 2. The Juul is very expensive for something that's worse than every other mod in terms of battery capacity and quality.\u000a\u000aThe fact is though most of those stealthy lil pod mods break easy and cost way too much. The ones I mentioned are cheap, they work, they're basically equivalent to anything else. 
p649
aVejuice is made of PG (Propylene Glycol), VG (Vegetable Glycerin), nicotine (optional), and flavoring. It is better than cigarettes because it doesn't have the thousands of chemicals and other shit that cigarettes do.\u000a\u000a\u000aIf you don't want huge clouds and just want your nicotine fix you'll want some sort of pod like the Juul, Sourin Drop, Breeze, Penguin etc. Or you can go with the AIO like the [T20 or T18](https://www.truenorthvapor.com/collections/starter-kits/endura). There are many more AIO that's just an example.
p650
aVAny thoughts on the new Sigelei Fuchai V3??\u000a\u000aI like my Juul but the pods are getting too damn expensive and I don\u2019t want to mess with refilling my old pods. I know sigelei quality has become hit or miss in recent years, but I like the look of the thing and the refill factor of it. Problem is I can find hardly any info on it. Anybody got experience with it yet? Thanks! 
p651
aVI've heard good things about the Limitless Pulse, if you want another option.\u000a\u000aOr, you could get a tiny mod an an MTL tank, such as the Digiflavor Siren v2 (rebuildable), Vandy Vape Berserker MTL (rebuildable), or Aspire Nautilus 2 (prebuilt coils). Alternatively, you could look at an all in one mod kit, such as the Mi One (prebuilt coils). All of the above should give you much better flavor than a Juul and allow you to use any juice you like, with more battery life to boot.
p652
aVI own the berserker personally and I can attest that it has a really tight draw if you want it. Throw in some microcoils and salts and you can definitely get a Juul like experience. You just have to be comfortable with rebuilding. Otherwise, the Nautilus will definitely go super tight too. All of the options I listed are MTL though!
p653
aVI heard something about the juul formula being patented as unique, due to its use of 1 specific ingredient which other "salts" therefore cannot use. And they have been out for a while.
p654
aVmy Suorin Drop thoughts\u000a\u000aPersonally i\u2019ve had the juul, both suorin airs and the drop and I can easily say the drop is my favorite of the 3. I use Mr. SaltE juice and the flavor and airflow is just unmatchable to any other device i\u2019ve used. The shape and weight make it very easy to keep track of and use and honestly i\u2019m a huge fan of the drop and suggest it to everyone
p655
aVMy Suorin Air is burning all my pods\u000a\u000aI bought my Suorin Air about a week and a half ago. I read the instructions and waited 5-8 minutes before hitting it after filling up my pod with juice. Within the first day, my pod's coils burnt. I decided to buy a new pod hoping that maybe I ripped the first one a bit too often and that not all Suorin pods are like this. I started being super careful about hitting it, only hitting it at the most every 30 seconds and I'd often end up taking minutes between rips because I was scared of the coils in my pod burning. Later that night, my new pod got burnt. This has happened another 2 times, with me buying pods out of desperation because I've been looking for something more affordable (pods wise) than the Juul and the Phix. By the way, I'm using Mr. Salt -E juice\u000a\u000aHas this happened to anyone else before? Did I buy a messed up Suorin? I'd really appreciate y'all's insight :)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p656
aVDoes this work with all nic salts or just the Juul pods with that acid they use?
p657
aVStandard nicotine is a freebase, meaning the outer electron shell is open and actively bonds.  This nic also leaves your system quickly and can be quite harsh.  Salt based nicotine is far closer to the form found in the plant and the outer electron shell is almost fulfilled.  (think noble gasses but not actually filled)  This leads to almost like a time release in your system, the nicotine stays longer.  It's also less harsh as noted in other comments, most companies hit it with a small amount of one of two types of acid to introduce throat hit.  I've vaped salt nic for about two years now from the juul to bottled liquids in other devices. I love it.  Typically you'll find nic strengths in 20,25,30,35,45,50 .  Always remember that these are not exactly suitable for high power applications.  I use a 25 in an ATOpack Penguin. 45's in suorin products or similar low watt, semi-closed loop devices.  
p658
aVThere is a local shop that sells starter kit. The pods are more widely available with different nic levels. It charges super quick, you can also refill the pods with a little bit off work. The pods sell for 25 for a 3 packs but are a lot bigger than Juul Pods. It\u2019s a pretty good system.
p659
aVit has a little docking block similar to a juul that you just put it on. the charge is advertised to last for 2 days IIRC (that isnt with heavy use)
p660
aVThis is the thing that looked interesting to me.  It's difficult to charge the Juul while out and about, even with a portable battery pack.\u000a\u000ahttps://bovaping.co/?scrollto=bopower

aV[HELP] Choosing a pod Ecig\u000a\u000aHi all,  \u000a\u000aI am new to this community on Reddit but I am currently looking to go back onto ecig. To be frank, I had two pen style one in the past and while the first one was ok, I really did not like the second at all which still rots somewhere. Offered by my wife at the time, prolly in 2016.  \u000a  \u000aLet me explain: I am a one pack/day smoker (Camel Blue), pretty much used to smoking but looking to quit progressively. What got me away from the Ecigs is mostly two things that are well known:   \u000a  - The burn taste  \u000a  - The liquid pouring everywhere and ESPECIALLY in the mouth  \u000a  \u000aOnce again, I would like to give it another shot. But I don't want to end up being a "geek" of the vape. I want something which taste like a cigarette, not leaking and especially not having spit backs. Something that I turn on and it works. Something that when I need to change the liquid, it works without flaws.  \u000a  \u000aSo i have been looking around over the past few days and I laid my eyes on the close system types, Juul, Bo One, Juno, Koddo Pad.  \u000a  \u000aBearing in mind my current consumption and what I am looking for, would you guys be able to guide me here? I also understand that salt nicotine is pretty much what I should look for.  \u000a  \u000aThanks in advance!
p662
aVThe Juul doesn't leak...and had no spitback when I used them. \u000a\u000aI smoked menthol and their menthol was spot on. I cant speak about the other flavors, I thought they were gross but that's because I only wanted menthol at that point. 
p663
aVNever had leaking problems using a juul and their prefilled cartridges.
p664
aV&gt; juul\u000a\u000aThanks, I'll check it out. I originally had a stick from Native roots that didn't have any problems. I picked up some cheapo no name carts off of ebay and they were great. Went back to get more and they were gone. Tried 2-3 other ones and they either burned or leaked. Sometimes both...*sigh*\u000a
p665
aVDid I\ufe0f just break the battery for my juul?\u000a\u000a[deleted]
p666
aVYou don't say? A juul user in high school? Howndid they get into this sub!? Oh yeah ...
p667
aVIt sucks that you got bad advice, but when you take something apart you assume responsibility for whatever happens. If you look at how the juul works about the only thing that's serviceable in the battery section is cleaning the contacts which should be doable with a qtip or a paper towel.
p668
aVI'm looking for something better than Njoy Daily\u000a\u000aHey everybody! \u000a\u000aI've decided to try and quit smoking a pack of light blue American Spirits a day by using a cig alike. I started by a Blu, but hated everything about it. Then I moved to a KangerTech Subvod-C with a local juice. The nicotine level wasn't quite right, and it didn't feel like I was smoking, then I got really nauseous and stopped using it. On the advice of a friend, I tried an Njoy Daily. It tasted like I was smoking silicone, so I only hit it a few times. I told my friend and he said thier quality control was shit. I tried one of the Bold ones and it was fantastic! It was everything I was looking for, it felt like smoking, it hit like a cigarette, it took care of my craving, it tasted decent and lasted about a day. I got some more and a pack of Kings the next day. I tried the Kings when I got to my car, and none of them worked. I had to go through 5 packs before I found one that worked, but I only get three uses out of one before it's dead and the Daily only lasted half a day.\u000a\u000aI'm looking for something similar to a Njoy Daily Bold, but something that actually works consistantly, and I don't want to spend a bunch on something without knowing if it's close to what I'm looking for ( since there's a lot of crap out there ).\u000a\u000aSo, do you guys have any ideas of something that would work? I've heard about the Juul, but it's a bit spendy without knowing if it'll work.\u000a\u000aThanks in advance!
p669
aVThe Juul will definitely work mate; the pods work out to be 59mg nicotine per ml. For ref, I managed to kill a 19 year pack a day habit on something with the same power output as the Juul and 18mg per ml. The pods are spendy tho; you can refill them but it might be a bit more fannying around than you can be bothered with. \u000a\u000aThere's a rash of pod systems out just now and also little ultraportables that you can put your own juice into. You can get bottled 50mg liquid from Mr Salt E and Level Up (I'm sure there's others by now). I don't know a whole heap about them but have a poke around for the following: ICare, Aspire Breeze, Suorin, Boulder Rock, Rofvape Peas and the Limitless...shit...Limitless wee thing that looks like a flash drive. Oh, and also /u/templetam's review of the Dolphin a couple of hours ago.
p670
aVThe daily\u2019s are what I\ufe0f use when I\ufe0f can\u2019t find pods for my JUUL (hasn\u2019t been an issue in the last 6 months. \u000a\u000aGet the JUUL with tobacco pods, you will NOT regret I\ufe0ft. \u000a\u000aI\ufe0f have been cigarette free for 14 months by using the JUUL with the occasional NJOY Daily supplement. \u000a\u000aAnd just so you know, these products both actually work because they use salt based nicotine which has a much more similar action to real cigarette combustion. 
p671
aVI know this is late but i have a solution for this if you didn\u2019t find out already. The cotton in the pods get burnt after time. When they get burnt, they taste .. burnt. That\u2019s that fire taste you got. You got to replace it at the minimum every two weeks maybe even earlier depending on how hard you use it. \u000a\u000aNow for the firing after the hit, it\u2019s because there is most likely juice leakage on the contact pads and it is interfering with the hit and keeps causing it to think you\u2019re sucking. Get a napkin and just dab it all up and make sure it\u2019s all dry. Usually when there\u2019s leaking it\u2019s a sign you need to replace that pod too. They\u2019re only $5 where I\u2019m at so it\u2019s not that big of a deal compares to a Juul pods. 
p672
aVIm an old Mom too and it WAS weird to vape a "flavor" at first. \u000a\u000aNow...i love my deserts at night...\u000a\u000aYes, there are tobacco flavors our there. \u000a\u000aIf shes not into refilling you could get her the Juul to start with. My boys got one for me. Im 3 months stinky free! \u000a

aV[Review] The Joyetech Dolphin - This is What You Should Buy Smokers for Christmas\u000a\u000aHello, friends.\u000a\u000aToday we're taking a look at the [Joyetech *Atopack Dolphin*](https://imgur.com/sk1DJWv), a new kit designed for new users that's a successor to the popular Penguin kit.\u000a\u000aJoyetech sent this to me for review and I'm finally getting a chance to post my thoughts on it. In short, it's good. Very good. I've spent a little under week with it, using it as my primary device. Honestly, I used it until I ran out of 12mg juice - just under 20ml of it. Usually, 20ml of 12mg juice will last me a week and a half of MTL vaping because I tend to MTL only in specific situations, but I couldn't put this thing down.\u000a\u000aAgain, I will apologize in advance for my pictures. I'm not a photographer. The rendered graphics are taken from Joyetech's website.\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a#Product Info\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a[The Atopack Dolhpin kit comes from Joyetech](http://www.joyetech.com/product/atopack-dolphin/).\u000a\u000a* [It's somewhat small.](https://imgur.com/a71Gq3W) 31mm wide, 100mm tall, and 50mm wide.\u000a\u000a* It's a very simple device designed for new users primarily. \u000a\u000a* 5-click locking and unlocking. No other features.\u000a\u000a* Made entirely of plastic, this thing is super lightweight. It weights 91g.\u000a\u000a* Will do both MTL or lung hits depending on the coil you're using. More on this below.\u000a\u000a* No airflow adjustment\u000a\u000a* The tank holds **6.2ml**. Also comes in a 2ml version for our European friend and a child-safe version.\u000a\u000a* The wattage is regulated to a maximum of 50w. But seeing as how you can only use their proprietary coil heads, I don't see how this is even worth mentioning.\u000a\u000a* Has a 2,100 mAh internal battery.\u000a\u000a* Charges at 2A. From dead to full took me about an hour and twenty minutes, so I suspect that's fairly accurate.\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a#Purchasing\u000a\u000a* This one was sent to me from Joyetech. I've heard they have an online shop, but I can't seem to locate it easily. I *think* this is the full production model, but I can't be sure.\u000a\u000a* [MyVaporStore has them in stock in all the available colors for $30.](http://www.myvaporstore.com/Joyetech-ATOPACK-Dolphin-Starter-Kit-p/joye-dol10.htm)\u000a\u000a* [VaporDNA also has them for $30.](https://www.vapordna.com/Joyetech-ATOPACK-Dolphin-All-In-One-System-p/jytdol.htm)\u000a\u000a* Basically, they cost 30 bucks for the kit.\u000a\u000a* Coils are around $12-$15 for a 5 pack.\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a# Breakdown\u000a\u000a**Packaging and Contents**\u000a\u000aI've always loved Joyetech packaging. Makes me feel like i'm getting my money's worth from the get-go.\u000a\u000a* [This is what the box looks like, repleat with adorable dolphin graphic.](https://imgur.com/1Gsjb0r)\u000a\u000a* [The back, with pregnancy warning, serial number, authenticity code, and package contents.](https://imgur.com/wfPUTv9)\u000a\u000a* [The side, with a small pull tab that removes the innards to reveal the product.](https://imgur.com/So7tn9X)\u000a\u000a* [And finally, the housing for the device.](https://imgur.com/CsnCG6C)\u000a\u000aNot to shabby. It's tightly packed in foam to reduce the chance of you receiving a broken device, which is the most bummer thing ever.\u000a\u000a* The mod arrives with a silicon sleeve on the mouth piece of the pod. It doesn't add anything to the vape, really, and as other reviews have pointed out, it acts as a collection point for moisture. [Here it is without the silicon sleeve.](https://imgur.com/N5DAcLm)\u000a\u000a* [The assortment of included items.](https://imgur.com/rYLgDhc) Missing from this package are the coils. Which I used, but are individually wrapped for freshness.\u000a\u000a**Overview**\u000a\u000a* [Stock shot from Joyetech.](https://imgur.com/Y9rfSwS)\u000a\u000a* [This thing is pretty cool looking.](https://imgur.com/twk0r1b) What you see on the device is the large firing switch, the USB port, and the battery indicator. The indicator has five lights to show you the approximate level of voltage left in the cell. As you can see in [this photo,](https://imgur.com/uXHJnJA) I had two lights remaining when these pictures were taken, indicating that I have between 10 and 29% battery life remaining.\u000a\u000a* [The reverse side is simple, with a small Dolphin logo near the bottom.](https://imgur.com/8wMChg7)\u000a\u000a[This is why, by the way, it's called *Dolphin.*](https://imgur.com/8jMFQd8) I can sort of see it. Looks a little more like a puffer fish to me. The section that represents the "eye" are the airflow for the tank/pod, just above the firing switch.\u000a\u000a* [This is what the bottom looks like, if anyone cares... which I doubt.](https://imgur.com/4MSUTSb)\u000a\u000aThe tank/pod in this thing is *massive.* The version I have holds 6.2ml of juice. I have one tank in my collection that holds more than that, and it's a 30mm tank. It's just absurdly large, and I love it.\u000a\u000a* [This is to give you and idea of how it fits together more or less.](https://imgur.com/J5lY6TB)\u000a\u000a* [Each pod has a small sticker that one can fill in.](https://imgur.com/1qPKu1J) I suspect that's so you can have multiple pods for multiple flavors? I'm the type of guy that vapes the same falvor from morning to night. Pretty cool idea, anyway. Not like i'll have to see it when it's in use, anyway.\u000a\u000a* [When shipped, there will be a plug in the bottom of the pod.](https://imgur.com/2jg8PDB) You have to remove that to pit the coil in. Once it's removed, [it's pretty easy to see how the coil sockets into place.](https://imgur.com/BE8MkJV) The coil actually nestles in a silicon pad. No threads whatsoever on this kit; it's all just plug and play.\u000a\u000a* Joyetech is calling these coils "JVIC" coils, which is short for Juice Vertical Injection Coil. Basically, it's just a vertical coil, but the juice feed comes from directly above. [They produced this graphic to explain.](https://imgur.com/oFWI97g)\u000a\u000a* Before the launch of the Dolphin, Joyetech didn't really have an MTL coil for this series of devices. With the introduction of this product, they also developed a MTL, 1.2\u03a9 coil. To restrict airflow, they added a small silicon housing to the higher resistance coils. [You can sort of see it here.](https://imgur.com/a/0sFCZ) On the right is a MTL coil, and the coil on the left, which is .25\u03a9, doesn't have the silicon governor.\u000a\u000a* 70/30 VG/PG has been working just fine for the MTL coils, although I wouldn't want to try anything more viscous. My DIY blend of 83.5%VG has worked just fine in the .25\u03a9 coil.\u000a\u000a* [Joyetech's graphic explains the airflow system used.](https://imgur.com/TDWizux) I'll admit that I was slightly dubious about getting a cold vape with all that travel, but it's been nice and warm.\u000a\u000a* Finally, [the juice port is on the side of the pod,](https://imgur.com/AfeiflF) which is hidden when fully assembled. The port is actually a little small, so you may have some difficulty filling with a glass dropped. I found that [unicorn style bottles fit in there just fine.](https://imgur.com/9hh9Txd) The tab system makes for very little mess.\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a#Review\u000a\u000aI fully didn't expect to like this thing as much as I do. The only close comparison to this thing that I own is the Mi-One, which has been thoroughly underwhelming for me. Especially with its claims of MTL and DL in the same pod?\u000a\u000aBut I was wrong. Very wrong.\u000a\u000aThis thing is *good.* \u000a\u000aWhile I particularly like the MTL coils, the direct lung coils *are also very good.* I'm getting great flavor, with enough airflow to be satisfying. In fact, it has more airflow than say the Hadaly RDA, or the Melo III, or the Goblin Mini v3.\u000a\u000aMouth-to-lung is where it really shine, though. Each full charge takes me through about 6ml of juice. It's a dense, satisfying vape, with tons of flavor. Better flavor than my beloved Nautilus Mini, honestly, and way less of a pain in the ass to refill.\u000a\u000aLet's talk about the size for a minute. In the world of pod systems, this thing is considered large. **But being large is a massive pro in this case.**\u000a\u000aAllow me to explain. Take a look at something like the Juul, undoubtedly the most popular pod system on the market. Were you to give that to an older smoker, what do you suspect their first impression of the device would be? Would they think that it was a marvel of engineering and to be cherished and looked after, or would it look like a thumb drive you can smoke? I'm not saying this is a universal reaction or even a common one, but for those who like *substance* to their belongings, the Dolphin could be perfect.\u000a\u000aMoreover, a Dolphin is simply much more difficult to lose.\u000a\u000aAll that said, it's not gigantic. [This](https://imgur.com/i870GUy) is what it [looks like when compared to an Eleaf Pico.](https://imgur.com/BbKXqea) Larger, yes, but not enormously so.\u000a\u000aSmaller than a pack of cigarettes and a lighter, for sure.\u000a\u000aIn short, this is a really good refillable pod system for those who have been unimpressed with the others on the market.\u000a\u000aThere's a few things I would have liked to see in the package, though.\u000a\u000a* The pod is a little difficult to take of. Some sort of notch to get my fingernail beneath would have been nice. For now, I push on the mouth piece away from the fire switch to disengage the pod then pull it out.\u000a\u000a* A little more clear documentation on how to assemble it. I figured it out, but it took me about 10 minutes to get there.\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a# Final Thoughs\u000a\u000aSo, who is this for?\u000a\u000a**Moms.**\u000a\u000aWell, moms and me. Look how cute this thing is.\u000a\u000aReally, though, any smoker who wants to try vaping. It would make a perfect introductory to vaping for anyone. I wish these had been around when I wanted to try vaping instead of the terrible, flavorless Ego nonsense.\u000a\u000aLook, every year we get a wave of people stopping by the sub to ask what vape to get a smoker for Christmas. I can think of no better option than this.\u000a\u000aBuy the kit. Get a pack of the MTL coils and a bottle of 12-18mg juice. Check back with them on January 2nd.\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000aFeel free to ask any questions, now or in the distant future. I'll do my best to answer.\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000aEdit: /u/mazman13 brings up a very good point below in the comments. Before you buy vaping supplies for someone for Christmas, be sure that they're going to be appreciated.

aVReview of Menthol Nic Salt Brands for Menthol Ex Smokers.\u000a\u000aHey guys!  Almost 4 months cigarette free here after 32 years as a menthol smoker with a TON of help from the great folks in this sub! YAY!  I just wanted to post a little review of some Menthol and Mint Nic Salt juices that I have used in the last few months and how they work for someone who was a hardcore lover of Marlboro Menthol Lights forever.  I quit with a Juul and I do love the taste of the Juul mint pods but they are ridiculously expensive so last month I bought a Suorin Air and after a few hacks and tricks and a learning curve it's working great. The question was with all the choices out there which juice would satisfy my desire for a MTL menthol hit.  Your mileage may vary here as these are just my opinions. I have 5 menthol Nic Salt Juices that are all about the same Nic strength.  These are in order of what I found to be the best MTL hit to satisfy this ex smoker.\u000a\u000a- Brain Freeze by Naked 100 Salts  this is the one! It smells like strawberries (my coworkers often tell me that they can smell nothing but juicy fruit gum when it's in my pocket) That is not what it tastes like though. It's a slight fruity hit but it's like sucking an altoid into your lungs in a menthol cigarette. It's amazing. It is truly freezing cold! I don't recommend vaping this outside in the winter. It makes me shiver, for real! \u000a- Dragonthol by Solace this is a really close 2nd and is my other all day vape.  Very cool actual menthol (not peppermint) and a slight dragonfruit taste. If the color purple had a taste this is it. LOL. \u000a- Mint Salts by CRFT this one is slightly lower nic but it is still a true menthol taste. If you were looking to refill a juul pod this a really good choice. \u000a\u000aThe two I didn't care for \u000a\u000a- Level Up Minty Menthol Salts. I really wanted to like this after many good reviews but to me it tastes like old peppermint candy at Grandma's house.  It's too peppermint and not a true menthol.\u000a\u000a- Mr. Salt E Mint.  This one was really my least favorite because it's got a sweet vanilla side taste that I just can't get used to. I'm not a fan of vanilla at all so that is probably why I don't like this one. It's also quite a bit thicker in consistency than the others and it doesn't vape well in the pod devices.  \u000a\u000aSo FWIW, that was my month long journey into figuring out what tastes like a menthol smoke and what doesn't. I hope someone finds this info useful! \u000a\u000aStay quit y'all! It's totally worth every minute of it. 
p676
aVThe frost bite juice reminds me of the juul cucumber flavor. The cucumber pod actually tastes like honey dew melon to me, kinda like the mango pod tastes like peach. 
p677
aVHard core ex menthol smoker here too... 3 months stinky free! \u000a\u000aI also quit with the Juul ...but damn those pods were going to bankrupt me! \u000a\u000a\u000aOnce over the hump of the first month (w/the Juul) I got some Strawjiki Freeze from Blue Dot and that's the one I use the most often as an ADV.  I gotta jump on that Brain freeze train, sounds like right up my alley.
p678
aVI am all about that brain freeze, and that Salty Mint with vanilla, but they almost can\u2019t compare to Brazz Chilled salty chitz from Dr. Shugarchitz, the fruit and mint blend so well on all my nic salt devices... even refilled juuls/phixs!!!
p679
aVare there any effects of using silica wicks like in juul?
p680
aVI'd try it sober first mate, drinking's gonna potentially exacerbate any feelings of nausea and if you're three sheets then you might not notice nic-sickness creeping in and stopping.  Couple of blasts of 25mg from a Juul knocked me on my arse. I'm generally 1.5mg ~40w for comparison. 
p681
aVRubi and Mi-pod review\u000a\u000aLittle background on my vaping experience. I have been vaping for about 6-7 years. I have purchased countless mods, tanks, rta, rda you name it. About a year and a half ago, I went full circle and was done with the rebuilding/mods. I have been exclusively vaping the juul since. So, with all the new salt nic eliquid companies entering the game. I am in the market once again/never ending search for the perfect vape with the less hassle. I am really into the draw activated devices hence this review/ thoughts.\u000a\u000aSo, my thoughts on the rubi and mi-pod. First off both devices did not meet expectations. The Rubi gave me a burnt taste about half way thru the first pod, it probably would\u2019ve been more noticeable at first but I was using a tobacco flavored eliquid (salt nic cubano). On the second pod I filled it and let it sit overnight using NKD freeze salt nic. After just a few hits I could taste slight burnt taste. I think the issue lies with the holes that feed the coil, they are way too small. Kinda like the old cartos we used to bore out. The device itself is quite impressive, however they need to redesign the pods to make it feed better.\u000a      Moving on to the mi-pod. It has way to much airflow for a good MTL. The tip is very awkward \u000aand uncomfortable. The actual vapor doesn\u2019t come out of the center of the tip, more to one side so it affects the way it hits the tongue. It wasn\u2019t a terrible experience, just not my cup of tea.\u000a     Now enter the Suorin Air. I actually purchased this device quite a while back. I picked it up super cheap with like 10 pods. I guess they were dumping them before the V2 came out. I initially used one pod with some 12nic juice and wasn\u2019t satisfied and sat on a shelf for a long time. So, when I was messing with these other devices last weekend, I said fuck it I\u2019ll try these juices with the saurin. And let me tell you it was on fucking point. Perfect draw for me, I\u2019ve filled the pod a couple times and almost ready for a third time and it is still vaping great. Probably gonna pick up the V2 next week. I like having 2 devices with me at the same time like I do with the juul. Using different flavors on the fly.\u000a\u000aHope this helps some of you guys.
p682
aVsame exact experience with the rubi! i\u2019m extremely disappointed, as it has the potential to be the juul killer.
p683
aVI'm sick of juul. Was going to get a sourin drop with all the hype, but just found mipod. I did find some bad reviews about quality just now though. \u000a\u000a3 weeks later, you still big on mi pod over sourin?\u000aAnything that I can refill my own pods would be great. Sick of juul quality and brown cartiridges... 
p684
aVDid you check one out? Was about to buy a drop and ditch juul when I found this thread. Now I'm torn
p685
aVWhat juice have you found to be the best? \u000a\u000aSo excited to open up the world of unlimited juice flavors and not deal with the sticky finicky mess that is juul! Thanks brother!\u000a\u000aClouds are still small enough to blow in to the street while walking NYC without being an asshole?
p686
aVI've been doing anything but Naked nic salts. So I don't really have a recommendation, just that Naked's nic salts are all disgusting.\u000a\u000aRight now I'm doing some Summer Vibes by Ripe Vapes and I love it. 30mg. I also like 50mg, which is probably a better transition from Juul.\u000a\u000aAs for clouds, it's all in the draw. You can choose to be annoying or not :) very flexible!
p687
aVYeah, or 3% or 5%. I think Juul is 55mg maybe? \u000a\u000a
p688
aVJuul is 5% and I've tried eon smoke which is 6% and available in 30mg pr 60mg bottles. \u000a\u000aBuying right now, thanks:)
p689
aVBuying empty juul pods\u000a\u000a[deleted]
p690
aVYou have posted in a sub dedicated to underage kids using the Juul. That puts your age into question. This subreddit is for people of legal vaping age. I\u2019m just giving people a heads up before they sell/give/trade you anything. \u000a\u000aAlso, if you just crossposted from the classified subreddit I doubt anyone would care but this subreddit isn\u2019t for buying and selling. We have a separate subreddit dedicated to buying and selling. \u000a\u000aCurrently with you posting all over reddit trying to buy empty Juul pods and posting in a subreddit dedicated to underage kids just 2 days ago (the second post your account made)...I\u2019m skeptical of your age and as I said, this is a subreddit dedicated to people of legal vaping age whether that is 18, 19, or 21 depending on where you live, though with New Jersey raising its age to 21 I don\u2019t know if there are any states that have a vaping age of 19 anymore. Still, your post history puts your age in question. 
p691
aVYou can help me by deleting your post.\u000a\u000aNo one on the sub is going to be stupid enough to sell juul pods to someone who posts on r/underagejuul\u000a\u000aSo like I said earlier, kindly go fuck yourself. 
p692
aVAlright buddy listen. I just typed in juul and clicked a sub and posted. Did not realize I posted in that underage category. Mistake, yes. Me owning up to it, yes. Deleting from that page, yes. Happy? Probably not.\u000a\u000aSo how about this, you go fuck yourself bud. \U0001f44d\U0001f3ff 
p693
aVLike I just told that last guy. I typed juul and clicked he sub and posted. I didn\u2019t mean to post there and I apologize for that. I took it down and want nothing to do with it. First time on reddit. Mistake, yeah. Which I fixed and owned up to.
p694
aVNot that I care if you believe me or not, but regardless of who post in your sub or anyone else\u2019s you don\u2019t know if anyone is of legal age. You kind of have to assume, yes? First time on reddit for me, ya. I type juul, and posted on that site, not realizing the underage part. Just clicked a sub. I owned to my mistake and deleted it. And for a further heads up, class of 2015, can be 21 or over.
p695
aVIf you were held back a year or started kindergarten/first grade late you could be 21. You\u2019re at least 19 or 20 if you graduated in 15, younger I\u2019d you skipped a grade. \u000a\u000aWith that said, you\u2019re right. without proof I can\u2019t say how old you are. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s a possibility that you are underage seeing as how the second post in your post history was in an underaged subreddit. But that\u2019s just a heads up to the users on this subreddit. \u000a\u000aThis still isn\u2019t the place for asking for Juul pods. The classifieds section is the correct place. You already posted there. Crossposting that post to this sub would have been a better idea than just posting here directly. 
p696
aVYou would think since he searched juul, he'd have some posts in the actual juul sub.
p697
aVPeople definitely make mistakes. I could easily be mistaken and you\u2019re in your 40\u2019s. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s a heads up and I won\u2019t say anymore about it.\u000a\u000aYou apologized for something that doesn\u2019t need apologizing for. A simple \u201cI fucked up\u201d\u2019would suffice which you have said and it is appreciated. \u000a\u000aAs I\u2019ve said a few times before, this is still the wrong sub. I hope you get a thread going that gets you some pods because the Juul isn\u2019t too terrible though I prefer the Phix. 
p698
aVThanks man. I actually appreciate that. I will take it off of this sub. And personally I like the juul. I have a few buddies that want refills for these, as I make my own juice. I have never heard of the Phix actually. 
p699
aVThe Phix is more reliable and more...cigarettey in my experience. Aside from that the flavors in the prefilled pods are better and the pods last me 3 times as long. I\u2019d totally recommend it. I have owned most pod based systems (Juul, Phix, von erl, bo, etc) and the Phix has been the best performing. 
p700
aVSee I smoked for 7 years prior to switching to a vape. Now it\u2019s just bulky and a hassle. I switched to the juul and really like the flavors I can put into. The charge is disappointing though. An hour, maybe an hour and a half. How\u2019s the charge on the phix?
p701
aVThat\u2019s a quicker charge than the Juul. Pod size is very nice though. Need to look into that. With me making my own I can run the nicotine high, makes me hit it a lot less. \u000a\u000aBoy do i like my pipe Tobacco.  Strawberry pipe tobacco. I know I know. Love my fruits though.
p702
aVI\u2019ve been told that the air is the better of the two. The drop is known to have loose pods that rattle a little in place. I have an air and have had it for a bout a day or two now, and I love this thing to death. Switched from the juul because I was done using pods that leaked and shit out after like 20 hits. The air is all around a solid little device in my opinion, but personally I have not had any first hand experience with the drop. I would say do some research online or watch reviews of both on YouTube before making your decision though
p703
aVMy juul won\u2019t draw but charges fine\u000a\u000aOkay so my juul was working fine and I didnt have any pods for about a day and then I got some and the light turns on when I click in the pod but it won\u2019t fire. I get nothing. I\u2019ve sucked all the juice out of one pod trying to get it to work and I\u2019ve tried everything I could find to fix it. Someone help please. I don\u2019t have a lot of money to buy a new device at the moment. \u000a
p704
aVI've been using a Juul for a few months now and I've found that this sort of thing happens frequently. Try cleaning the metal connections inside the Juul device and on the bottom of the pod. I usually use a q-tip with a bit of alcohol. If you have a can of compressed air, you can also blast the inside of the device just to clear out any gunk that may be in there. As long as there's a clean connection between the pod and the device, it should vape no problem. Hope that works for you.
p705
aVMOST INSANE JUUL HACK (60PODS 20$) NOT CLICKBAIT\u000a\u000a
p706
aVBecause this should be titled \u201chow to refill a juul pod\u201d. Instead you took the clickbait route
p707
aVYou can add whatever you like - because salts are generally higher mg, it's not recommended to use them in big chunky setups, lower power devices like the Suorin and Juul and whatnot are ideal. If you're using 'traditional' juices, stay around 50/50 to 65VG/35PG - much higher VG than that and shit gets to thick to wick and vaporize effectively because the device doesn't have enough grunt.
p708
aVJuul is very nice. Just recently picked one up and it's super great as far as mtl goes. Pods can be expensive but you can refill pods with your own nic salt juices. 
p709
aVRip trippers... I swear his main viewer demographic is the 15 year old with a black market juul, impatiently awaiting the day they can finally hit the big leagues, and buy a SMOK!

aVLast summer, I went through about a Juul pod a day. That's the equivalent of a full pack of cigs worth of nic per day. I was 150 pounds and couldn't  really afford to lose weight, but I lost five pounds over the summer. For some reason, it felt like my stomach had constricted to the point where I was rarely hungry and if I was, I would only need to eat a little to feel full. \u000aI think everyone probably has different experiences  with how nicotine affected their appetite but it definitely killed mine. \u000aI wouldn't recommend vaping as a weight  loss regimen since it will cause you to eat less and probably not get as many essential vitamins and minerals. It does however definitely work. 
p711
aVGet a juul. 
p712
aVFirst off, I'm relatively new to RTA, so thanks in advance for your guidance. A couple of months ago, I switched from Juul to using nic salts in a Nautilus X on a Pico, with pretty good results. I decided to take the next step and get a Kayfun Prime, figuring it would be even better than the Nautilus.\u000a\u000aUsing 28 gauge kanthal, I build a 1.8-1.9 ohm coil and wicked it with japanese cotton. As this is my first RTA, I watched several videos first, including videos specifically for the Prime, so I think my build and wicking were at least moderately ok, even if not perfect. On the first day, the flavor was pretty good, but by the next morning the flavor was seriously diminished (almost non-existent) so I dry burned coils and inserted a new wick. This time the flavor was pretty harsh right from the beginning and frequently had a faint burnt taste. I experimented with a range of wattages from 9-14, but nothing seemed to help. For reference, on my 1.8 Nautilus X, I would normally vape between 12-14.\u000a\u000aSo far, the Prime is delivering much worse results than the Nautilus and creating much more work, but I'm sure it must be user error. I haven't tried non-salts in it yet, because I really like the salts. Any suggestions on how to fix my Kayfun experience? Thanks!

aVBest Juul replacement?\u000a\u000aSmall and form factor, but I want to be able to put my own juice in it
p714
aVI second the Aspire Breeze. Small and compact. Allows you to put ANY juice in it. I use 50mg nic salts. Coils are dirt cheap and last a decent amount of time. Dirt cheap compared to other coils. Flavor isn\u2019t amazing compared to a full set up type thing. But flavor is definitely better than a juul and cheaper. 
p715
aVThat's the thing though, even with the same juice, juul pods last me easily 3-4 refills.
p716
aVJuul Art???\u000a\u000aHey guys so for some reason I\u2019ve been collecting my empty juul pods keeping the color cap on also and they started to pile up in my drawer and as of recently I started making art out of them! I\u2019d be willing to buy anybody\u2019s empty pods/color caps from them or donations are acceptable! Strictly for art purposes! Just trying to be creative! Hoping someone here has some empty ones I can work with! Thanks guys! 
p717
aVOK I get it. Forgive my ignorance on the juul, I'm not 15. Any reason why you can't use beads or any ojuuy more readily available form of plastic? 75c each x however many hundred you need seems like an incredible waste of $$$ imo
p718
aVNonoo no worries I\u2019m asking a weird request to begin with. Nor am I 15 I\u2019m just a creative. I\u2019m using Juul pods because it\u2019ll appeal to the current generation as apposed to everyone else that\u2019s making art with paint and paper. Trying to go the extra mile 
p719
aVWow underage juul subreddit? Didn\u2019t know such a thing existed... stay there... https://www.reddit.com/r/UnderageJuul/comments/7g93el/juul_art/?st=JAKENCAF&amp;sh=e2e662d4
p720
aVSo why post in a underage juul sub reddit? Like taking to children?
p721
aV\u201cTaking to children\u201d good one! And no lmao nice try though I put it there because a majority of juul users are underage [USA Today Underage juul use]  (https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2017/10/31/juul-e-cigs-controversial-vaping-device-popular-school-campuses/818325001/)

aVSo you were soliciting minors for their used Juul containers? 
p723
aVThe current generation meaning high schoolers?\u000a\u000aFor real though, I don\u2019t know who you think the current gen is and why they would give a shit about Juul caps.
p724
aVnot sure if this is what you're looking for at all, but figured I'd throw it out there. there's a thing called the Bo which is similar to a Juul/Phix/etc. and the tobacco pods for them taste exactly like a honey berry Backwoods

aVeleaf icare 2 tips and tricks\u000a\u000aHey guys, a little backstory first, scroll down a bit to get to the tips!\u000aHere's some pics: https://imgur.com/a/pKhSy\u000atl;dr: use the new SC coils with larger wicking holes and remove the center mouthpiece.\u000a\u000a------------------\u000a\u000aI recently took advantage of a sale from Fuggin Vapor for an eLeaf iCare2 and a 120ml bottle of juice for $20. I work in a kitchen and all of my coworkers smoke cigarettes. They've been curious about my vape, but think it looks too complicated. I figured with Thanksgiving and Christmas coming up, I should get them a little something and this device looked about as simple as can be. I read reviews and they all were pretty positive. I bought 5 and waited a couple days.\u000a\u000aI decided to try one out first before wrapping them all. I screwed in the coil, filled it up with the Max VG juice (more on this later) and waited a few minutes for the cotton to absorb. I made sure not to drip any juice down the center of the coil, which leads to a flooded coil which is hard to get rid of considering the airflow only goes one way. Don't drip down the center of the coil!\u000a\u000aThe juice was freshly made and was very perfume-y, but I didn't have any other high nicotine juice (I bought 12mg for the iCare) to use. After about a week they've improved dramatically in flavor.\u000aHowever! I noticed my coils were burning out quickly. If you look at the wicking holes on the coil, they are about the size of a ballpoint pen tip. For a Max VG juice, it has a hard time absorbing and thus if you even remotely chain vape, it will start to burn the coil. \u000a\u000aI checked online for different coils and discovered they make a different version called the SC coil specifically for high VG juices. I hadn't heard anything in reviews about this new coil and started to do some research. I looked at the pictures and the wicking holes were a lot larger. They were also 1.1 ohm versus 1.3 and were made of Stainless Steel. This version of the coil was kind of hard to find on vendors doing Black Friday sales, but I found them at Eciggity for $6 for 5 coils (plus 30% off). Not a bad deal! I picked up 5 packs and some Mr. Salt-E Strawmelon Taffy 25mg juice. I just received them today and they make a world of difference! There is more of a cloud, it is more flavorful and you can notice wicking bubbles almost immediately. We'll see how long they last, but I imagine it will be much longer than just the 2 days I was getting before.\u000a\u000aAnother tip! When I was looking at the mouth piece, I noticed that the center wasn't level. I always thought it was a hard piece of plastic that was built in. It turns out it is a little rubber stopper that can be removed! This really opens up the airflow and gives you the ability to run a q-tip on the inside, which I was surprised how dirty it has already become in my pocket in just a few days.\u000a\u000aCombining removing the rubber stopper in the mouthpiece to maximize airflow and the new 1.1 ohm SC coils with larger wicking holes for Max VG juice (or anything above 70% really), the vaping experience on the iCare 2 improved dramatically. It can now hit like a restricted direct lung and can be chain vaped without fear of the coil burning out. It is really a great little device that has replaced my costly Juul for my pocket-friendly carry and honestly I find myself using it more than my mod and tanks. The higher nic content and smaller cloud is nice when out in public or on break at work. It definitely draws less attention and looks more like a cigarette puff than chuckin clouds.\u000a\u000aIf you've been looking for something to get a friend to introduce them to vaping, but don't want to invest too much, check out the iCare 2. It is around $15 most places, but you can find deals all over for less. The battery lasts me all day and only takes an hour to charge, and it is pass-thru, so you can use it while it is charging. One of my coworkers said he has only had 2 cigarettes since I gifted it to him, so it definitely helps!\u000a\u000aAnyways, that's enough of my long winded rambling story. If you've got one of these, give it a try and let me know what you think!
p726
aVWill do. I'll probably order one this week. I loved the Juul for travel but the shit quality control did that in. The iCare was awful. Hoping this fits the bill. Flying with a full setup is a pain in the ass.
p727
aV&gt; Flying with a full setup is a pain in the ass.\u000a\u000aAgreed. I don't like the puff-activated pod kits, personally. Too many instances of either not activating the atomizer or having it continue to fire after a puff.\u000a\u000aYou might want to look at the Joyetech Dolphin as well. I'm testing one for review right now and have so far been impressed. It's much larger than a Juul, about the size of an Eleaf Pico.
p728
aVIf you want super easy go with one of the pre-filled pod systems. \u000a\u000aJuul or Von Erl are the ones that you buy the pods and just snap them in, no refilling, wicking, etc. 
p729
aVHave you talked to her about this? Has she shown any interest?\u000a\u000aYou can't just throw these at a smoker and expect them to switch.\u000a\u000aUnless something has changed recently, you're going to get recommendations for the Juul. Easy to use and widely available - she should be able to pick up new pods at a local gas station, you may want to check before you buy anything. \u000a\u000aOnline is always an option, but Mom user levels vary widely, is that something she'd be comfortable with? Are you going to be ordering  for her?
p730
aVI've not talked to her about this... no. She would say no if mentioned. I thought a surprise attack may work. May not.\u000aI like the option of her getting pods at gas stations.\u000aThis is just something I'm thinking about at a gift for her. Thanks for the suggestions. I'm going to look at the Juul.
p731
aVA second recommendation for the Juul. Going to look now. And if it worked for you! I'll hope for the best!
p732
aVI got my gf to quit on a Juul and she eventually wanted a actual mod. She is now staying off cigs with a Super Tank mini and Ipower 80w.
p733
aVGood Luck!\u000a\u000aMy kids sort of did a sneak attack on me. Got me one for my Birthday. I did say frequently though how I wanted to quit...just never could/would. \u000a\u000aI tried a couple times but nothing ever "felt" like smoking til the Juul. \u000a\u000aI hope this works for your Mom!! 
p734
aVget the Juul AND the Endura then she can experiment :)
p735
aVThe Juul for ease of use and closest representation of a cigarette, the Joyetech Penguin/Dolphin and Innokin Endura series would all be solid options. The Penguin/Dolphin are only like $20-25 and hold a ton of juice.
p736
aVLooking for a really small vape\u000a\u000aWant a tiny vape that is no bigger than a pack of cigs so i eadily can carry it in my jeans pocket\u000aNeeds to be durable\u000aBeen looking at the lady q, something like a juul would be good\u000a \u000aAlso want to put my own juice in it since i cant oder that from abroad
p737
aVI still don't see how a Juul looks like a USB drive other than being rectangular. Although I have a couple of USB drives that look like Renova Zeros. LOL
p738
aVMinifit definitely has a USB drive feel. I guess the juul vaguely does... 
p739
aVI can see it with the Minifit because it's smaller. The Juul just seems too long to mistake it for a UBS drive to me.\u000a\u000a
p740
aVWell that will stop students from bringing valuable information to school, and stop little Tommy from stealing his dad's juul and bringing it to school. Congrats.
p741
aVEveryone I know in college vapes, all of my high school aged siblings vape (juul).  So by my estimate, a fucking lot.
p742
aVEven though Catholic schools have to rely on baseline education policy, they're still allowed to make their own rules. Which sucks, but it is what it is.\u000a\u000aI have a strong feeling that they're updating their own education program to the cloud to nix physical storage entirely, and mixing that with the current Juul crisis to double down on it. Insert moral superiority, or what have you, mixed with tech. The article isn't giving you the full picture.\u000a\u000aArguing that they're one and the same as public schools is a farce, because they aren't. Anything past this would be arguing about whether they should exist at all, and none of this would have to do with Juul itself (being a poor example).
p743
aVCopied for you. \u000a\u000aGrand Island Central Catholic students will no longer be able to bring USB drives to school once classes resume Jan. 7.\u000a\u000aIn a YouTube video posted to the school\u2019s Facebook page Thursday, Principal Jordan Engle announced that USB drives will be banned from GICC. He said the rules change is a result of e-cigarettes becoming popular at GICC and at schools across the nation. While he did not specifically mention it by name, Engle was referring to the Juul brand e-cigarette that resembles a USB drive.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou see a lot of news stories about how the marketing of these \u2014 whether or not it\u2019s geared toward teens \u2014 is a point of debate,\u201d Engel said in an interview with The Independent. \u201cIt is something a lot of administrators around the country are talking about and you see a lot of messages about how different schools are handling this. Nobody is immune to this. It is one of those things where, as an administrator, you know it is happening in your school.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000aEngel said GICC had dozens of reports of students in possession of e-cigarettes this school year. The problem, he said, is that these are just reports and not necessarily legitimate cases.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe problem is threefold,\u201d Engle said in the video. \u201cFirst of all, the evidence that I have been presented and the investigations I have launched into this have not yielded enough information for me to have reasonable suspicion to search a student. The next problem with these (e-cigarettes) is that they are easily concealable. They are very small, they come apart and can easily be concealed. There is not a lot I can do there.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe added e-cigarettes are banned from GICC school grounds and that this policy must be enforced.\u000a\u000aUnder the new rule, if a GICC student is found in possession of a USB device, Engle said it will be confiscated and \u201cconsequences will be doled out appropriately.\u201d He added the GICC administrative team will meet to discuss specific consequences at the beginning of the year.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is definitely going to be one of those things where we confiscate it, we contact the parent and tell them about the rule,\u201d Engle said. \u201cWe don\u2019t see these things very often and our students are very tech savvy. They know how Google Drive and iCloud works. To a person who is aware of the situation, a student using a flash drive should be a little bit suspicious considering how convenient it is to transfer data electronically.\u201d\u000a\u000a Editor Choice\u000aSponsored by Editor Choice\u000a20 Old Toys Worth A Fortune\u000aSee More\u000aEngle said he realizes that a student may need to use a USB drive to store files for class use. However, he said, with GICC\u2019s one-to-one initiative, students have access to Google Drive, which can be used to store up to five gigabytes of files.\u000a\u000aIf a student needs to bring a USB drive to school for a class or any other purpose, Engle said the must check the device into the office, have him or another GICC administrator inspect it and make the request known to administration ahead of time.\u000a\u000a\u000aEngle said GICC administration will encourage teachers to have their students use Google Drive to store files as opposed to a USB drive.\u000a\u000aWhen asked by The Independent about specific instances where a student would need to use a USB drive as opposed to Google Drive, Engle said they may need to be used by journalism students.\u000a\u000a\u201cA lot of our journalism equipment use micro USB cards and you might need a micro USB reader,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a situation where communication is going to be a necessity because those micro USB readers really look the same as what you would see on an e-cigarette charger.\u201d\u000a\u000aEngle said the new rule is meant to provide awareness to students and parents.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am just making people aware that this is an issue and making our students aware that we know what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cThose e-cigarette devices are disguised to look like something else, so it is more of an awareness thing than anything.\u201d
p744
aVEspecially carpenter pencils in wood shop because they are at least more size wise a Juul than a micro usb reader. Have these people even Seen a Juul? Easier to hide a cigarette. 
p745
aVYes I can, have a juul device as back up and that tastes normal. I had my girlfriend try the ones I thought were defective and she agreed they taste nasty.
p746
aVvery nice of you to do this. i hope you are sure with not having a vape as back up incase of a stormy day\u000a\u000ai know you haven't used it in a while but i like to tell all my brethren who are quitting the cancer sticks.\u000a\u000atwo is one and one is none. thats why despite not liking the juul, i keep one in my car tucked away with a charger and extra pod :) 
p747
aVIssue with my Myle\u000a\u000aHey so I\u2019ve been using this myle thing for a while. Love it but I\u2019ve been having an issue where it is not drawing anything. I puff and puff and nothing comes out! The LED battery lights are fine and the blue light comes on when I put the pod in. It just doesn\u2019t work. I have a feeling it could be water damage but I have no clue. Any tips on what to do with it? Really don\u2019t feel like getting a Juul. 
p748
aVempty Juul compatible pods?\u000a\u000aOver the summer I bought the iJoy Elite Mini which comes with a Juul pod adapter and one empty pod. Didn't touch it for 6 months because I wasn't thinking about it that much at the time. \u000a\u000aWhile I was home for Thanksgiving break a friend of mine gave me some peach salt nic juice he didn't like and once I got back to school I tried it out. \u000a\u000aThe pod has long since been gone but I want to use it again which leads to my question: which open pod systems have Juul compatible pods? I know the OVNS JC01 pods are but I like to have options. Thank you for your help!
p749
aVTrust me, get a Juul. No work required
p750
aVThe Juul is the least painful transition because you can get refills at convenience stores. You wont have to learn about pods, coils, eliquid, nic salts, pg/vg ratios, mg levels, battery safety, external chargers, wicking, etc.\u000a\u000aThen when you want to refill your own, you can pick up Sylo pods for the Juul.\u000a\u000aAlternatively, theres the Kwit stick.\u000a\u000aAlso if you do want to learn more about nic salts, etc., theres the Vladdin RE that doesnt come with juice.\u000a\u000aFor button activation, the Aspire Spryte, Aspire Nautilus, and Innokin RE that are good.
p751
aVThere are many ways to get started depending on how much effort you are willing to put in. Juul is the simplest (I'd recommend a 3% pod, the 5% is a lot unless you are a very heavy smoker). Next would be a pod system like the breeze 2 mentioned where you add juice that you buy separate from the pod. After that something like the zenith tank and a simple cheap internal battery mod, here you buy coils that you replace and juices. I would recommend skipping the refillable pod systems - most are hit and miss quality wise and can be very frustrating to find one with good flavor and doesn't leak to some extent.\u000a\u000a There are plenty of videos on YouTube to show you how to use whichever option you choose.
p752
aVI agree with everyone else. Start small and get into it slowly. I started with the aspire one, That one you have to replace coils and such, but eventually you may want to explore more into it. You\u2019ll get there. I haven\u2019t tried the Juul, but I\u2019ve heard good things for people that used it to get of cigarettes. Good luck!
p753
aVI'd vouch for Juul - it's simple and easy to use. Cartridges are pricy, but no pain with e-liquid either.  \u000aIt will do until you feel more enthusiastic.
p754
aV&gt;Do we have enough studies done on both devices to say for sure which is safer than the other?\u000a\u000aSince IQOS in particular was also aggressively marketed in my country, there were some news articles regarding these devices, because you couldn't escape the advertising and people were asking questions:\u000a\u000aIn German: https://www.sueddeutsche.de/gesundheit/iqos-studie-1.4119199\u000a\u000aThere was an assessment done on available studies by Erikas Simonavicius from the King's College in London. He found 31 scientific studies concerning heat-not-burn devices, of which 20 were ordered or carried out by tobacco companies themselves.\u000a\u000aOverall there seem to be a lot less harmful substances emitted in heat-not-burn devices compared to cigarettes, but one study also found, that some harmful substances supposedly appear in much worse concentrations in heat-not-burn devices. But who knows. We've seen this with vaping studies too, where the methods employed for testing do not in any way represent how the devices are actually used in real life and misleading conclusions are reached.\u000a\u000aI haven't seen any scientific comparison between regular vapes and heat-not-burn devices. But my gut instinct just tells me, that one of them is still tobacco and the other is (disregarding the myriad of chemical compounds in flavours) just nicotine in PG and/or VG. I've personally tried the IQOS and to me it tasted and smelled like a regular cigarette, but not nearly as bad. If it quacks like a duck...\u000a\u000aAside from actual scientific evidence, I personally think these devices are a step in the wrong direction. With regular e-cigarettes we steadily moved away from tobacco companies and their cigalikes (although the lines get blurred again with big tobacco partnering with Juul for example), while having an experience that comes close to smoking compared to gums/patches/inhalers. With heat-not-burn devices we're being enticed to come back into or not even leave the fold.
p755
aVWell I\u2019m currently switching over from a juul which I was using because it stopped me from\u000aDipping. I am so sick of spending money on the pods every 4 days so I wanna get something that I can just use juice for. \u000a\u000aI went into the vape shop and they recommended me a Vapito smaller vape that works well but maybe looking to upgrade into something a little better. Is this enough info? Any recommendations or am I better off just staying with this? Thank you!
p756
aVI'm not a fan of the suorin. I preferably want something that comes with two pods and is portable within the 30 dollar range. I'm looking for a pod system specifically.  I hate juuls, I liked the smok infinix and the novo, but they just break. I've heard a lot of good about the mi pod, but I really dont know. 
p757
aVI started in 2009 with what I can describe as a \u201ccig-a-like dripper\u201d and have basically run the whole spectrum from then until now and I finally kicked cigs for good with the juul and then better pod mods 
p758
aVOne of my buddies has been smoking 4 packs a day for at least 6 months now. And has done so many times in the past. I think in the winter he tones it down a bit but in summer/warmer months he goes hard. He smokes Pall Malls, which while cheap(er), they actually burn a bit slower than say Marlboros or Camels. And he smokes 100s. \u000a\u000aIn my golden days I managed to smoke two packs of unfiltered Pall Malls/American Spirits a day no problem (while doing landscaping. Outside all day for 12-14 hours at a time. Easy to chain smoke constantly.). I easily could've taken it further if I had kept at it. This dude's been working at this same place for like 7-8 years. I dunno how he tastes anything at all anymore. \u000a\u000aI tried to get him on a Juul but at 4 packs a day, not even the Juul can really touch that. He managed to dual use and go down to about 2 packs a day, but ultimately lost interest and just went back to chain-smoking. 
p759
aVThat's crazy I think the American smokes go down faster. My friends bring back American cigarettes all the time and they burn faaast. Way faster than what I'm used to. That's pretty crazy to smoke that many in a day and not have any straight up medical issues. Good on you for trying to get him to quit. I know the juul didn't work but your not out of options. Get him a single coil RTA with a drag mod or similar so he has battery life and a nice chip for heavy haulin. Run it with a .5 coil and at 18-22 watts. Hello be able to hit sal nic at 36mg no problem. Big nice blast hits. Consistently all day. It works especially if you smoke a lot so it could possibly work for him. Those juuls don't hit close to what this would and consistent with battery life for him to not have it die and just smoke.
p760
aV5-6 cigs a day is relatively small usage. If you're gonna get him a pod system like a vladdin I'd suggest going with 30mg or lower. The 50mg pods like the main ones for the juul are better suited for people who smoke a pack per day or more
p761
aVYeah,  while the IQOS may be similar to what he is used to in smoking,  it's expensive,  still delivers tar and other bad stuff that what we generally use do not.  \u000a\u000aProbably the Innokin EQ,  or even something like a Juul or whatnot to start with?
p762
aVI think the JUUL has probably been more successful than anything else. I would not be in the business of recommending it however.
p763
aVI quit with a juul and hated the tobacco flavored juice so I needed it.. I haven't smoked a cigarette in 6 months from a 16 year habit now. This is a huge mistake. 
p764
aVHelp me quit juuling\u000a\u000a[removed]
p765
aVThe best way to stop juuling. Pick up a newer salt nic device that uses pods and use a 9 nic traditional. Get the salt nic out of the vaping community. When I used salt nic I always had this pain in my throat. Not a good experience. The 9 Nic will give you a good fix off of what your use to  but wont have that damaging effect.
p766
aVNot to you specifically OP. But I find it so weird that we suddenly have an influx of people who want to stop vapint, specifically Juul usage. Anyone else noticed that?
p767
aVI would have taken you seriously had you not said juuling
p768
aV1. Give juul away.  2.  Quit Juul.  3.  Graduate High School (hopefully) within 2 or 3 years

aVAnyone interested in Baja Blast flavored juice?\u000a\u000aI made a post here a while ago about baja blast salt nic juice I was working on. I have the formula from my old ejuice company selling regular vape juice and I\u2019ve adapted it to work in the juul / phix / sourin drop, it\u2019s turned out to be pretty awesome and I feel i\u2019ve perfected the flavor. \u000a\u000aJust wondering if anyone else wanted some of this to refill their pods/devices. If you\u2019re interested just send me an email at bajablastpods@gmail.com and I can ship you a bottle of baja blast nic salt juice. I also have a mango flavor that\u2019s a lot better than the popular ejuice companies if anyone is interested. \u000a\u000aThe flavor and overall quality is way better in my opinion than a lot of the popular refill juices. It\u2019s not overly harsh and I only used the highest quality nic salts and ingredients so it\u2019s a very smooth flavor that doesn\u2019t burn your mouth while still delivering a great throat hit and buzz. It\u2019s what i\u2019m vaping now so if anyone\u2019s interested just send me an email and let me know. \u000a\u000aIt\u2019s finally ready, available in regular nicotine and nicotine salts.

aVThe development of E-cig\u000a\u000aE-cig is more and more popular nowadays. Here is a brief introduction to the development of E-cig.\u000a\u000aIn about 2003, Chinese people called Hon Lik created a company called "Ruyan", it means like smoke.\u000a\u000aBefore that, an American has found but he didn't use it for commerce.\u000a\u000aLike other electronics, ecigs sell to Europe and the USA first.\u000a\u000aE-cig can be divided into several mainly products. Pod mod, sub-ohm tank, heat not burn(if included.)\u000a\u000aMany factories mainly located in Shenzhen, China. Brands also have appeared, Juul, Smok, Aspire, Joytech, etc\u3002\u000a\u000aBecause there are many smokers in the World. Tobacco tax is beneficial to the whole country, many countries decided to ban e-cigs to protect their interest.\u000a\u000aIn fact, there are many benefits if you use ecigs.\u000a\u000a1. **For active smokers**. It's less harmful than cigarettes. Without an unpleasant smell. Proved by test data.\u000a2. **For passive smokers**, there is no second-hand smoke.\u000a3. **More flavor options**. You could choose any liquids, any flavors you like.\u000a4. **Some of my colleagues quit smoking**. They have smoked for over 5 years before.\u000a5. Pod mod delivers Nic-salts best. It has **throat-hit** to replace the feeling of cigarette.\u000a6. **Healthier lifestyle**.\u000a\u000aThis field has a great prospect and China is a great market!\u000a\u000a**Hope all factories could improve their products and all smokers could have a satisfying using experience, healthier lifestyle.**\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;

aVIt is crazy that the US government/FDA is so upset about teen JUUL use or other vape mods being used. Whilst I\u2019d be the first to agree that not vaping is by far the best option, especially for young people who have their lungs still growing and developing, how can it possibly be better that teens smoke when the negative health impacts of smoking are absolutely known. The carcinogens in smoke from combustion are very well studied and understood.\u000a\u000aSo why would a government be so upset by a huge rise in the rate of teens vaping, when that increase has in itself CAUSED the decrease in teen smoking in that same period. Also shock headlines stating x many thousand percent increase in teens vaping is simply because the numbers at the beginning were so low, an increase from 1 to 2 is a 200% increase for example so of course it will be a huge percentage increase even if not that many young people do vape. And the low number of percent decrease in smoking is the exact opposite, that small percent decrease is actually many thousands of young people NOT smoking which can only be a good thing.\u000a\u000aNow I understand that the long term effects of vaping flavourings etc may not be that well understood. The rest of the ingredients are well understood. Fog machines, and medical delivery systems have resulted in people inhaling PG and VG in large amounts for many many years. And even if negative impacts are found in the future how could they possibly be any worse than the well documented effects of smoking tobacco?!\u000a\u000aRant over I guess, but the FDAs stance really does seem crazy and is influencing the policy making of other countries such as Australia. It is time for the anti vaping backlash to stop and to embrace the potentially huge benefits of vaping. So come on FDA, sort yourselves out, get out of the pockets of the tobacco companies and support perhaps the single biggest contributor to the health of the populace in many many years.\u000a\u000aVape on people, vape on! ;)

aVMyBlu Alternative?\u000a\u000aBought one of those MyBlu starter kits back in July to help with quitting cigarettes. Haven't smoked a cigarette since.\u000a\u000aI've gone through a few of these Blu devices, and they keep breaking. And the liquid pods always leak, it's gross.\u000a\u000aThey don't have the starter kits on sale anymore ($1 instead of $20), so I'm not really inclined to drop $20 on a device that I know is glitchy.\u000a\u000aWhat alternatives would you guys suggest that I can easily find at a convenience store?\u000a\u000aThe Juul doesn't sound that great to me, plus I'm trying to keep nicotine levels on the lower end.\u000a\u000aI picked up a Mark 10 Elite for cheap on the drive back from Christmas, but they've been discontinued apparently.\u000a\u000aThanks!
p774
aVWhy are there no big draw activated devices on the market?\u000a\u000aWe have small, cigalike products such as the juul. But we have no cigar-like products. Am i the only one that would fancy a big, draw activated tube mod? As much as i appreciate buttons, a draw activation feature is very appreciated sometimes
p775
aVTrue, but at that point i would expect an on/off switch. In all my time using juul pods and novo pods i have never had one autofire.
p776
aVNeed help quitting\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve been vaping for a while now, ever since my dumbass teen self thought it would be cool. Now that I\u2019m out of the house I don\u2019t have a job, parents won\u2019t give me allowance, I\u2019m in college, and I\u2019m broke. So I can\u2019t afford vaping. I tried to have a one week hiatus but after day one I had a splitting headache and I couldn\u2019t resist the minty mango 5% from my suorin air. Now I\u2019m quitting for good. I threw out my juul cause I realized just how bad it is for my body. Three days in and I\u2019m getting the headaches, the moodiness, and I\u2019m dreaming about hitting my juul which is fucking sad. Does anyone have any tips for quitting vaping? It\u2019s tearing my life apart and I need to stop
p777
aV&gt;  I threw out my juul cause I realized just how bad it is for my body.  \u000a\u000aIt's not bad for your body, exactly. Nicotine really isn't any worse than caffeine under most circumstances. But clean air &gt; vaping &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; smoking for sure. Hopefully, this will be a good learning experience for you.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aJUUL uses 59mg nicotine and your minty mango is 50mg. That's quite high to just quit cold-turkey. And certainly too high for people to use who (I'm assuming) didn't smoke much or at all to begin with. You definitely did not do yourself any favors here by using such a high nicotine content right off the bat.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aThe easiest way I've seen people quit vaping entirely is by tapering down the nicotine so you can wean yourself off. If I were in your shoes, I'd be looking to any vaping friends for help with juice, or even going to shops to see if they have discounted juice. I've even filled people's tanks at my shop for a couple bucks or free for customers I've had that were in a bad way. If I were in your situation I'd first hit up anyone I know or go to a shop. If you can't find help that way, I'd personally just push through the shittiness for a while. Especially given the fact that if anyone mailed something to you it would be another 3-10 days before you actually get it. \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aIf you find yourself completely without and having to trudge through the shit, just remember that you *will* be okay. The headaches will go away, the moodiness will fade. You are just, unfortunately, going through nicotine withdrawals.
p778
aVJust fyi, but he does mean 50mg/ml. Juuls are 59mg/ml too. Such high nicotine options are recommended only for pod style devices, he's not hitting it like you would a normal mod. 
p779
aVI like the fact that other companies are trying to muscle in on juuls turf.
p780
aVHuh interesting, it's like a slightly bulkier Juul. Hopefully the coils don't suck as bad.
p781
aVWould love the OVNS; I know they have refillable pods and are also compatible with JUUL pods which is super convenient. I like the performance of JUUL but don't want to support the company, especially now with the investment from Altria, so this would be a nice device to have. Also been hearing good things about OVNS this year but I'm still yet to try a product of theirs. Anyway, thanks for the giveaway and have a happy near year, Level Up!
p782
aVDo any of you use the nic salt to refill juul pods? Really want to try some but unsure if the 70/30 will wick properly with them 
p783
aVYes, it works just fine in the Juul. Probably 50% of our customers use it for that device in particular. In fact, we found 50/50 to be too thin and leak into the Juul and ruin them.
p784
aVSome of the comments on there are pretty meh, even those made by some of the vapers.\u000a\u000aLeaves me thinking companies like Juul should have more nicotine strengths available though. 
p785
aVIve had a smok novo for a while, \u000a\u000aAll i can say is that I am used to taking big ass rips off a juul and laving a small amount of vapor come out. But the novo rips hard so i wouldn't recommend class tokes lol.
p786
aVI'm looking for a good small vape setup. It can take 18650 batteries as I have a ton. I'm tired of carrying huge Vapes in my pocket and I don't want a juul, although the portability is amazing. Can be nic salt. I'm open to a lot of possibilities. I had the aspire breeze but it was hot garbage. Thanks.
p787
aVEverybody who vapes uses Juul pods, and everybody who uses Juul pods sits down and completely empties one full Juul pod (OR MORE!) every time they vape.
p788
aVHow much of the Vape market does Juul Actually control? If you add in Mods ( I guess the FDA considers them a Tobacco product \U0001f644) I cant imagine them close to the numbers people are throwing around. I mean one reporter said 68%??? 
p789
aVHey all- Man it's been a while since I've been around ECR. About a year and a half ago I grabbed a Juul. That replaced all my mods and tanks. Now I'm sick of the Juul flavors so, I'm out looking for juice again. On another note, It's good to see a few names that I recognize from my time spent here. I hope everyone is doing well! \u000a\u000aQuick question for you guys. Keep in mind that I can't find the search feature on mobile. Does anyone know anything about ejuice.deals? Are they a new front for ejuice mafia? 
p790
aVGot a Kwit Stick, first thoughts.\u000a\u000aI've been using a GhoStick for a few months now and it seems the pod stock is slowly getting thinner and thinner as time goes on. \u000a\u000aSo I ordered a kwit stick for something a bit more lightweight and refillable. The quality seems nice and its just a little bit bigger than the Juul.\u000a\u000aBut damn are those some harsh hits with their included juice, it's a nice system but it's gonna be hard to want to buy their prefilled pods if I want to keep using it. Also like I've read online and can confirm the Tobacco flavor is horrid.\u000a\u000aI put some redhouse juices in to replace the tobacco and it's instantly smoother.\u000a\u000aJust a heads up for people looking to buy it. I hope they make some empty pods available eventually, it's the only way I can see myself sticking to it as my main nic salt vape.
p791
aVI like the Kwit stick, the draw is much better than the Juul. Refilling with the included bottle or a syringe is a must or else itll be a mess.\u000a\u000aI'm with you with the high nic they include, not completely bad for people that need to "kwit" cigs. I dont inhale it and still can get some nic from it. \u000a\u000aYes, they do need empty pods. My starter pods are just about to need replacement, I'm only going to get the watermelon pods. That flavor is pretty awesome. \u000a\u000aFwiw, the juice they sell has low nic options.
p792
aVI suffer from coughs and phlegm from nicotine salts, anyone else went through this? (Juul, Breeze 2)\u000a\u000aHey guys. I've been vaping for quite some time now and I absolutely love my Wismec RX Gen3 mod. The tank, the mod and my juice has never caused me any issues whatsoever. I have recently discovered that Juul is finally available in the UK and wanted to take a closer look at the new nicotine salts, so I picked up a Juul and an Aspire Breeze 2 to test it all out. (I also love the small, compact form factor for both, I'd be very happy taking these with me when going out for a few hours instead of my regular mod)\u000a\u000a*(Note, my Juul pods are 20mg and a pod took me 3 days to empty out)*\u000a\u000aAnyways, I've used the Juul for about a week and gotten fairly used to it. I love the small form factor, the liquid from the pods is also very nice. I however realised that while I was smoking it, I was coughing a ton. I read more about it and found that the amount I was coughing, is just part of the transition and it's fine, I just need to adapt and get used to it. I do agree, I coughed much less, however if I used it a fair bit at night, the next morning I would wake up with a ton of phlegm in my throat and I would barely be able to speak again (this would usually be gone in the next 1-2 hours and by drinking a lot of water - not a big issue, I thought) The issue is this, I've been smoking this for about a week now and all of this is still present. I've gotten back from my holiday and started using the Breeze 2 with 10mg nicotine salts. and I literally just went through the worst yet. Lot of phlegm, absolutely unable to speak and a lot of coughs. I've drank about 1L in the past hour and I am now fine, but it really does sound, look like as if I had a cold, which I luckily do not.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aI do not think I'm allergic to anything that's in my nic salts. and just wondering, how long did the translation for you guys took to nicotine salts? I can still use my regular vape (I know, it's a different substance, liquid) and suffer from absolutely nothing. I think I'll stop using both my Juul and Breeze 2 for about a week and see if I feel much better and then give it another try.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aPS: There are 3 reasons for me to try Juul, Breeze 2 and overall nic. salts. 1, I love the form factor. 2, I was extremely curious how effective, great these could be alongside using normal vape - I am trying to transition from 6mg juice to 3mg once I empty out my 6mg liquids (still have like 250-300ml left) 3, General curiosity for new products :)
p793
aVI know, it does very much seem like a normal seasonal illness. I am certain that I do not have any seasonal illnesses, however to back that claim up, I will stop using my nic. salts for a week to be absolutely certain. The main reason for thinking I am fine is because if I smoke less Juul, or Breeze the day before, I will wake up just fine, so yeah, here we go with the blind test.
p794
aVI can't say I've experienced that much myself, aside from Juul pods giving me a bit of a scratchy throat, but I attribute that to typically only using 15mg salts vs the 59 on the Juul's stock pods.\u000a\u000aIt is curious that you can isolate the issue to a single device though.
p795
aVIve had a similar experience. \u000a\u000aI\u2019ve used box mods (3mg), feather (25mg), novo (50mg and 25mg), juul (25mg)\u000a\u000aOn the box mod, no bad experience. Feather, none. \u000a\u000aOver a 2 month period:\u000aOn the novo at both mg\u2019s, I had horrible throat pain, phlegm, and coughing. I switched out juices thinking it might be the ingredients of said juice, even switched strength. The symptoms remained constant. \u000a\u000aI switched back to box mod for a week, and the symptoms quickly went away close to none after the week. I tried the novo for a couple of days and immediately the symptoms went back. \u000a\u000aI stopped and went back to cigarettes for a week, symptoms left again. After a week, I tried the novo again and same thing happened. \u000a\u000aAs of a few days, Ive been using a juul with the same juice I used in the novo (25mg strength only). Since Ive been using the juul, no symptoms have shown. Contrast to using the novo where symptoms begin after a few hours. \u000a\u000aWhile using the novo, Ive also switched out cartridges whenever I change flavor and every 2 weeks. \u000a\u000aMy experience for what its worth.

aVYep, the local gas station has juuls and they don\u2019t ID anyone. A little disgusting tbh.
p798
aVWell Juul doesn\u2019t make me forget. And in life, sometimes you just need to forget bruh. 
p799
aV&gt; Sounds like a regular vape shop. My only issue is that sometimes I realize I'm.out of juice late at night and most vape shops around here close at 9\u000a\u000aI've been thinking about this. A couple convenience stores around me started limiting vape carts (and probably juice) to 1 package per person. Seems reasonable since this is generally like 4+ packs of smokes.  Similar to Juul's 16 4-packs per month limit.  Probably accomplishes the goal in a better way than just sending an adult  to the tobacco shop to get a bunch for distribution like I used to send 21+ friends/family to the liquor store.
p800
aVStill, what's the problem? Most B&amp;Ms card in the first place. There are three near me, and all of them card when you come in, just like a weed store and some liquor stores.\u000a\u000aSo who gives a shit? Is it really *that* big a deal if you can't buy juice at 7-11? Maybe this'll help snuff Juul and cigalikes out. Good by me.\u000a\u000aThis is like when laws started popping up that restricted vaping to places you can legally smoke cigarettes. *So what?* We're the ones using inhalants, other people don't want it in confined, public spaces, *okay*. We can take it outside. Get over it, guys, this isn't religion here.
p801
aV&gt;  Maybe this'll help snuff Juul and cigalikes out. \u000a\u000aJuul is literally 80% of the vaping market all by itself.\u000a\u000aIt ain't going anywhere, and will probably outlive all of us\u000a\u000a80%
p802
aVHow long have you been smoking?\u000a\u000aWhy type of device are you using to try these flavors?\u000a\u000aI\u2019d give a strong minty flavor a try and see what you think about that. I\u2019ve helped many people quit smoking with Juul Mint pods. Minty juice has a fair amount of throat hit so you can really feel it when you are vaping it, and it generally has (tons) of flavor as well. 
p803
aVI\u2019ve been smoking for about 17 years now, I\u2019ve tried both a sub ohm setup and a pod system. I can try a mint flavor, if you me recommend me some that would be amazing! Also with Juul I like the simplicity of it but I feel like the pods for what you get are a little on the expensive side compared to some refillable systems.
p804
aVJuul giving away **free** pods/cartridges, as well as referral programs.
p805
aVI'm talking about Juul giving away free pods/cartridges, as well as their referral programs.\u000a\u000a
p806
aVThe message that the free pods/cartridges Juul gives away are NOT safe to use.
p807
aVWhat I meant was that there must be counteraction to the free pods/cartridges Juul gives away, as well as other predatory tactics these companies use. And the most honest/simple way of doing so is sending a message that vaping is NOT safe.
p808
aVDoesn't take much to be 95% safer than smoking. But most importantly, "95% less toxic than cigarettes" doesn't mean that a teenager, hooked up on nicotine by the free pods/cartridges Juul gives away, will not develop something nasty over 30 years of vaping on a consistent basis.\u000a\u000aIn fact, one of the researches of the study which you're quoting (the "95% less harmful" study), John Britton, [clearly states](http://elearning.ncsct.co.uk/e_cigarettes-stage_5) (at 00:40) that it's quite *unlikely* that vaping will not cause any health issues later on down the line. \u000a\u000aSo what are we supposed to do when Juul gives away free pods/cartridges to children, hooking them up on nicotine, potentially creating life-long vapers (which, again, will indeed most likely have health consequences)?\u000a\u000aThe most honest/simple way of counteraction is sending a message that vaping is NOT safe.
p809
aVHarping on with same mantra over and over with ZERO citations of Chidren ( more than one of nearly a billion ) actively being given Juul as you claim.
p810
aVOk. Please show me where Juul is knowingly giving these to underage people &amp; skirting the law. Or is it possible maybe, just maybe, you need to take responsibility for your own damn kids doing something they shouldn't instead?
p811
aVLol where exactly is Juul handing out pods to children? That sounds beyond ridiculous, they sure make adults pay out the ass for them. Also at the end of the day, nicotine is not that hard to stop. I vape like crazy but recently had my wisdom teeth pulled so I had to go 4 days without vaping. I literally didn't even notice any sort of withdrawal from it. It's definitely habit forming but when pushed, I think most people could give up nicotine without much issue. I'm normally on the side saying nicotine isn't all fun and rainbows with zero harm but you sound ridiculous. 
p812
aVI hate to say this but, Juul. It's the convenience, not having to push a button, not having to refill, similar size to a cig, high nicotine that does it. 
p813
aVThanks, I really considered a Juul for him. And probably in hindsight should have gotten him one. Just Vaping myself I looked at battery life, ease of use , tank size. And him as a Senior on a limited budget disposable pods are pricey. Of course cigs are not cheap. 
p814
aVThe Fine Bros released an \u201cElders try Juul\u201d video where they obviously bash on electronic cigarettes using the Juul controversy for momentum\u000a\u000a
p815
aVI do not encourage a witch hunt or anything of the sort. This popped up in my recommended videos today so I watched it, and was appalled by the blatant hate towards Juul and vapor products in general, the producers as well as the elders. \u000a\u000aThey kept tossing them questions encouraging anti-vaping propaganda and only the negative aspects of vaping. They would try it and say \u201cyeah I can see why this would appeal to kids, it should be kept off the market\u201d, but isn\u2019t the point of the show to find out what they think about vaping? Because they seemed to find the flavors intriguing, yet the entire focus of the video was about how dangerous and \u201cfor kids\u201d vaping seems to be. \u000a\u000aMaybe I\u2019m overreacting, but it almost seems like Big Tobacco wrote the Fine Bros a fat check for this video with how it was laid out.

aV&gt;free base juice made with 50/50 being sold in a vape shop? \u000a\u000aThis is so weird to me, maybe in the UK it's different but over here freebase is way more popular than salt, there are a whole ton of brands that do 50/50 freebase all the way up to 18mg (our legal limit is 20mg but most brands stop at 18mg). I know more MTL vapers who prefer freebase unless they're refilling a juul or using a pod system like the breeze 2. Is the US attitude a lot different?\u000a\u000a\u000aI'm currently vaping a 12mg freebase 50/50 eliquid (Five Pawns Black Flag Risen Enriched which is an amazing tobacco if anyone cares)
p819
aVI did that for a while. After using pods like the sourin and juul it really didn't feel that much harsher but definitely had more nic per hit.
p820
aVI have alot of 3mg nic salt juice i use in sub ohm tanks. Just because i could go higher in nic since nic salts ar smoother i dont want to.\u000aI just slowly went to 0 nic since my goal was to get of nic all together.\u000a\u000a\u000aWhoever started to say  18mg freebase = 50mg nic salts is a moron.\u000aI think the hype with nic salz and alot of shops telling that if you use nic salz you can or even must use higher mg is just plain stupid and the bigest harm to vaping since the beginning of vaping.\u000a\u000aSince juul is being released in switzerland there is   alot of bad discussions in the media, since they do not know shit about vaping at the first place but the main discussion is the 50mg nic pods. \u000a\u000aThey already have to push it down to 20mg here,  since we have a max nic concentration law.\u000a\u000aIf nic salts where used in \u201enormal\u201c mg just like like freebase, the bad press would have been less harsh.\u000a\u000aBeing able to use 50mg without the bad taste of a freebase nic is just a other way to get a better buzz. \u000aThis is as harmfull to vaping as all the weed liquids who ar used in vape gear.\u000a\u000aThis all leads to regulations nobody wanted.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

aVyou are correct. the \u201cadults\u201d have no idea what they are doing. the just talked to one of my younger cousins who is telling me that in his high school they are installing nicotine detectors in the bathrooms to stop the \u201cjuul epidemic\u201d. it is like these nerds were never kids and don\u2019t understand that the more you restrict something, the more a teen will seek it
p824
aVThing is many of these parents are not smart or bother enough to go to a vape Shop and know about the 0. Easier if using Juul to just pick up pods at gas stations or stores. Or they could be using a Juul and kid stealing the setups. I made vape cases years ago and had cheap nonfunctional display mods  to show them off. Kids stole them all the time even when I tried to keep an eye out.

aVAnyone care to tell me the flaws in this artical?\u000a\u000aThis states vaping can cause all the same cancers as smoking? This true?\u000a\u000ahttps://www.yourtango.com/2018319952/what-is-a-juul-is-vaping-bad-for-you-health-risks-dangers-of-juuling-nicotine-e-cigarettes\u000a

aVThey said "Juuling". I will take everything said by them as horseshit. 
p827
aVThe article is about the dangers of "Juuling". Which includes inhaling flavorings not isolated nicotine. Which potentially may be carcinogenic.
p828
aV"Even using a Juul once at a party can permanently make one more susceptible to developing a heavy nicotine habit." This isn't heroin. Most people who over use on their first attempt get sick. I hardly doubt this would cause an addiction.\u000a\u000aThis article was written by a bad journalist. It was written recently using old, bad, information. 
p829
aVI am unaware of any actual data as it come down to your smoking habits. How many puffs how long they are and such. But truth.com says 1 Juul pod is a pack of smokes and I highly brought that maybe 4 or so. 
p830
aVAccurate-I personally use nic salt juice at 50mg in mine usually (kicking the Juul habit), but I\u2019ve also used 6mg juice in it with good results. 
p831
aVSick of the juul. Alternatives but with same pods?\u000a\u000aThe battery life is awful. Apart from the ijoy diamond, are there any alternative devices that read and use the Juul pods ? \u000a\u000aMaybe variable voltage/wattage? \u000a\u000aI bought a load of juul pods before Christmas and want to use them up rather then throwing them all away.
p832
aVOVNS JC01 Pod system. Supposed to be able to use the Juul pods.
p833
aVCan confirm the OVNS is compatible with Juul pods, and the battery lasts WAY longer. Uses a micro USB port for charging, which you may consider a plus or a minus. Good little device though!
p834
aVWhat about a carrying case with a built-in battery to top off your JUUL. [e.g.](https://www.vaporl.com/ovns-j-box-pcc-charger-1200mah.html).
p835
aVLmao, did the kid take the juul at the end?

p837
aVNaw I love vaping but kids love juul
p838
aVDamn juul got me more hooked after I switched from a pack a week to 4 pods a week. I'm gonna try nicotine gum hopefully I can do it.
p839
aVPod system for someome trying to quit smoking\u000a\u000aI got my mom to agree to try to quit if I bought her a pod system. She's smoking about half pack a day and knows little about vaping aside from the 'truth' campaign false ads. Rather it not be a Juul but thats just because I think theyre dumb. Suggestions?
p840
aVI would go with a Saurin Air. They are also cheaper than JUULS. If she likes it you could just move her up to a rba and mod when the saurin quits working. 
p841
aVNicotine level in Juul is too high for your mother IMO.  Maybe try myBlu. They are still on sale. Or for bigger pod systems, EQ, Cobble or Nautilus AIO. 
p842
aVI've tried a bunch of pod systems including the Juul, and to be honest, if you want any chance of this sticking you need to buy her a kit where she can pick up pods from a gas station. If it becomes any sort of hassle at all, she will say fuck it and be back on cigs.\u000a  \u000aI know you said you don't prefer the Juul, but it's got a crazy amount of salt nic in it, and is super easy/convenient.\u000a  \u000aI picked up a Vuse recently (gas station pods) and it is shit compared to a standard Juul.\u000a 
p843
aVI agree. The Juul will be the most effective of actually being successful in helping her quit the cigs. After that is established, then she might be more open to other larger devices, a fire button, refilling liquid, changing coils, etc. 
p844
aVjuuls got 3% now :) 
p845
aVi see this question a lot and i really think you can\u2019t beat the juul \u000a\u000ait\u2019s convenient as fuck bc you just pop a pod in, it\u2019s sold at virtually every gas station in the country so you never have to worry about \u201coh it\u2019s easier to go to the gas station and get a pack of cigs\u201d if you\u2019re in a pinch, and it really gets the job done 
p846
aVI suggest if she doesent want to spend so much money a Smok Infinix is pretty good and doesent hit to hard I suggest probably 30mg or 45mg if she\u2019s smoking half a pack a day pods are carried by pretty much all Vape shops and websites and are rarely out of stock.  It\u2019s also extremely cheap depending if your buying online or in store .  I thing there around $17 usd online and probably 25 or 30 usd In store (just a guess) it will run her a long time unless she is using improper charging bricks (basic apple charger is perfect) any cord will do just fine.  If still not getting the urge to quit I would suggest a VooPoo Panda because it hits harder and is just as simple.  They are a bit more expensive probably 35 in stores.\u000a\u000aBut the Juul is the most simple and indestructible vape very easy to use and you can just walk in to a gas station to get new pods Juuls will last vastly longer than any other in my opinion and with my experience if using normal pods, Eon Pods, etc refilling pods will leak which can go into the device and break it but if making sure it\u2019s dry where you insert the pod you should be just fine.
p847
aVMerry Christmas!\u000a\u000aI'm pretty picky when it comes to flavors, and I'm looking for a new juice (preferably salt nic). Something that isn't in your face sweet, but not too fruity. Menthol is iffy with me, but I absolutely love the Juul mint juice, but have been having a hard time finding anything similar to it
p848
aVSpending christmas at my parents with my 2 little sisters. \u000aI would love the pod kit my juul bothers me with inconsistent drags. 
p849
aVi would love any type of kit! i can see great uses as a daily driver tank or a small pen type of look for traveling with.. even the pod system would be great to test besides juul and the breeze 2
p850
aVthere is a button, the novo can have some auto firing issues when you pull from it, like a juul, but the nord has a button 
p851
aVHere's an idea - raise the fines for selling tobacco or vape gear to kids to $10k, payable by both of the clerk and the store the clerk works for (so $20k per infraction, in theory, although the clerks will take forever to pay) every time. Use 5% of those fines to pay for increased enforcement, possibly give another 5-10% to the individual department that caught the lawbreakers.\u000a\u000aEventually, the only source for Juuls and smokes and whatnot will be bootleggers (aka college kids buying them for their younger siblings to sell at school) and if you go after them next...
p852
aVForbes Magazine on JUUL sale to Altria: Marlboro Modernizes Its Method Of Peddling Death To Kids (Lie down with the dogs, get up with their fleas)\u000a\u000a
p853
aVWe need more journalists that actually vape. Then we'd be spared from all these retarded articles and headlines full of lies.\u000a\u000aThe amount of kids using nicotine doesnt change. It's just that they're choosing Juul when they would've chosen cigarettes before. That's an inconvenient truth that they knowingly veil from the public to deceive us.
p854
aVMy personal favorite is \u000a\u000aBoth the Surgeon General and FDA chief Dr. Scott Gotlieb refers to "Juuling," or teenage vaping as "an epidemic."\u000a\u000aSo apparently all teenage vaping is now called Juuling?
p855
aVWait? What Juul owns 68% of Vaping market??? Since when?  This woman definitely in LA LA Land with a Lot of her \u201cFacts\u201d and conspiracys. Check out her link at bottom of page .. nuff said. 
p856
aVCant wait for them to put all those yummy chemicals into juul pids and marijuana!!!
p857
aVhmmm the pink cartoonish mod at the top and the pod mods. I've been wanting to try a pod mod other than the juul for a while.
p858
aVSame as PMI have announced, and most likely Altria will announce soon with their recent stake in JUUL. JTI has also invested heavily in RRPs. Writing has been on the wall for a while now. Not really surprising.
p859
aVAltria just invested Juul ...
p860
aVYeah i appreciate draw activation sometimes, i find it more neat. I love both firing methods in different ways. I also have never had problems with juul pods, and one of my friends has a Novo that has never crapped out even after like 8 refills. \u000a\u000aHappy Holidays!
p861
aVI dont really know a lot about pod systems. \u000a\u000aI bought a juul from a friend for $10, didnt like it at all, felt i was getting freaking hooked to it.  sold it to a classmate(university) for $40. \u000a\u000aNow im regretting selling the juul, i should have gotten some refilable pods and some low mg tobacco nic salts and given it a chance. \u000a\u000aI have an awesome mod, and three supposedly awesome rtas, but apparently my juice is shit because the flavor is either almost nonexistent (Transmission by The Verge)(Kringles Kurse by halo)  or its just plain shitty (Tribecca by halo) \u000a\u000aI thought it was my attys, that i didnt wick them correctly or that the coils were shit. But i went to a very helpful vape shop and they looked at them, re-wicked them themselves and it tasted the same. \u000a\u000aIm just bummed out that im not getfing the flavor i expected. \u000a\u000aAnd to make matters worse, i bought an Njoy daily mint while i was out drinking and OMG this little pen tastes delicious. The tobacco is so rich and my breath feels minty for half an hour after puffing for a few minutes. \u000a\u000aOnly problem is the price, and that its nic salts. I get hooked too easily, takes about a day of constant resisting to get unhooked.
p862
aVShould I get a suorin drop?\u000a\u000aAre suorin drops a good pod system compared to juuls?
p863
aVGreat question!  I've been wondering the same.  I like the idea of buying different flavors.  It just seems a little overwhelming with the choices.  \u000aThe juul is so easy to use but the nicotine levels are so high. I'd like more choices and the sourin looks like a good option.  
p864
aVThe pods burn quick and the device can have some internal issues, check out r/Suorin and r/juul
p865
aVJuul gets slammed for distributing $2billion to employees as bonus - this article representative of many\u000a\u000a

aVFriends quit juul, started smoking\u000a\u000aI found out today that two of my friends have quit juuling after they couldn't get the pod flavors they wanted (mango &amp; creme). They both started smoking recently and they don't seem like they want to go back. They're college age so it's hard to know who to blame for the issue but either way I'm sad about it and I don't think this is how the industry was built to work.
p867
aVLooking for a vape as close to an analogue as possible for my dad\u000a\u000aThis is for my 60-year-old father, he's been a smoker his whole life and wants to give vaping a shot.\u000a\u000aHe's a "ritual" smoker, likes pulling the cig out of the pack, flicking his lighter, etc. so I think he'd need something as similar to a cig as possible to help him get off the analogues.\u000a\u000a**The tricky part:** He's very old school and is slow to adapt to new technology. I gave him a pair of wireless headphones a while back that he used for about a week before he went back to wired, he complains about his old iPhone being too slow but is too afraid to get a new phone and learn how to use it, stuff like that. So it would have to be something *really* easy to use, if I try to explain how to change the wattage on his mod or even how to replace a coil he would probably immediately run away in utter terror.\u000a\u000aHe suggested getting a Juul or whatever they're called but I told him those really aren't that good and there are better options.\u000a\u000aWhat would you guys suggest? Money is no object.\u000a\u000aAlso, what are some good tobacco flavor juices that you would suggest? He wants something "that tastes like a Camel".
p868
aVFor simplicitys sake a Juul would be the best. There are other pod systems but I doubt he'd want to deal with refilling and cleaning pods and changing coils.\u000a\u000aJuuls are widely available, easy to get pods for and easy to replace if it gets lost or breaks which could lead to a lower chance to buying a pack of ciggies. Also if he's been a heavy smoker for years nic salts are probably better for him
p869
aVI realize this will probably be down voted like crazy but...\u000a\u000aIf money is no object and he's extremely averse to interacting with coils/batteries/etc, then why not start with a Juul?  I quit smoking with a Juul, and had previously been unsuccessful with more traditional vapes. Within a number of months, I was ready to invest more time and energy into vaping so I could have a better and cheaper set up. But the simplicity, wide availability, and similarity in use were critical when I was so used to smoking cigarettes constantly. I also think if he's interested in and familiar with Juuls, go with that momentum because that goes a long way too.
p870
aVJuuls are expensive but they're the ideal quitting device imo, the most similar to an analog that I've found.
p871
aVHuh, didn't really think about it that way. Not really too much to loose by giving a Juul a shot, I'll pick one up for him next time I'm at a gas station, couldn't hurt.\u000a\u000aThanks \U0001f44d
p872
aVSourin iShare comes with two juul-like devices in a charger case that's kinda like pulling cigs from a pack. Juat use higher strength nic salt juice with them.
p873
aVDefinitely do the juul. Closest experience to a cigarette I've gotten and I just started using it recently over my rdas and such. My only gripe is the occasionally leaky pods (All 3 of my packs that were all fairly leaky were all replaced by them for free and were not bought through then directly) and buying them from anywhere not juul is definitely a bit more expensive. Even buying them from juul can be expensive but it's definitely a solid little device imo. Very easy to use especially for someone just looking to quit. The possibility of upgrade is definitely not out of the question in the future but it's a very good starting point. 
p874
aVHonestly, the juul would probably be the best thing to start him off with.  And I think third parties are selling refillable pods for it, nowadays, that you can fill with a good tobacco flavor.
p875
aVHad the same scenario with my father in law a couple months ago, he's 68. Went with the Juul, nothing beats the convenience of being able to go to 7-11 or whatever and pick up pods. Also, the Juul website offers a free pack every 5 packs or so if you use their subscription service. It works out to $13 a pack.\u000a\u000aLater on, he could get some Sylo pods for his Juul. They are refillable pods that can be used in the Juul. \u000a\u000aFor juices, I found that Rocket Fuel Vapes Reaper Blend tastes a lot like a cig, it even has that burnt nasty aftertaste that I used to love lol. Also other ones that are close to a cig are Black Note blends, goodejuice Patriot, Sloth Sauce fauxbacco.  \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;
p876
aVTry the Vuse Alto. It's Vuse's answer to the Juul. Less expensive in the long run.
p877
aVAnother vote for juul to quickly get off the cigs (only device that helped me quit, and I tried a few). Then he can branch out to less expensive, less convenient, less cig like vape options. 
p878
aVLike everyone else says, Juul. But I thought the same thing when I quit, that I wanted something as close to cigarettes as possible. \u000a\u000aAs it turned out, it wasn't those particular rituals that were important. Now it's winding coils, changing batteries, fiddling with wattage settings, mixing liquids, adjusting airflow rings, etc. \u000a\u000aAnd, I found the Juul was just too weak for me. I just sit there hitting it and never feel satisfied.
p879
aVDoes the smok novo have coils that need to be changed? I see there\u2019s an older version with no button and a newer version with a button, that comes with two different type of coils, a stronger battery, and a bigger pod. I\u2019ve been using a juul in place of cigarettes and it\u2019s worked pretty good so far, but the battery like on those isn\u2019t great, and the pods don\u2019t last that long. It\u2019s nice because it\u2019s so simple. Nothing to do but charge it and change the pods out. The smok novo seems pretty simple too, but just wondered if you\u2019d need to replace coils in it. I\u2019m looking for something really simple. 
p880
aVDo the pods burn out over time? I get that you refill them with your own juice, but do they only last a couple days or weeks and you buy replacement ones? Not a deal breaker for me if so, just curious. The juul pods aren\u2019t refillable and you just toss those. 
p881
aVBefore I switched to juul my windshield would become a nightmare from the VG even if I vaped with the windows down. I've also seen posts with VG related computer problems from vaping inside. 
p882
aV3 days since surgery, can I juul?\u000a\u000aI had wisdom teeth removed 3 days ago no. (Had it Wednesday morning, it is now friday night). Should I be okay to do light sucking on the juul now? I dont mean like big rips, just enough to be able to get some sort of buzz. 
p883
aVI'm not a doc but I'd say no. If you do, you chance having to go back to the dentist and take even longer to get back to your juul. I remember asking friends the same question but for stinkies when I got mine removed...they also said "no."
p884
aVI never really had an actual addiction in the first place after this juul breaks (which is about to happen its been under water 3 times) im done
p885
aVI'd say probably not, but like others are saying not a dentist. Just play it safe and lay off the juul for a while you might not even want it after you're done healing mate 
p886
aVArticle from May 2014 for Some Background on Juul's Founders &amp; Their First Companies, Ploom &amp; Pax\u000a\u000aAs we know, Altria's sister company, Philip Morris International, has a heat-not-burn product on the market (IQOS) that is awaiting FDA approval for sale in the US. It will be distributed exclusively by Philip Morris USA - a wholly owned subsidiary of Altria - and will run on Marlboro Heets, which will be subject to the MSA. Prior to the Juul deal, IQOS was regarded as Altria's answer to the e-cig problem. Maybe it still is, IDK. \u000a\u000aAltria's decision to buy a stake in Juul is interesting for a lot of reasons, but also (imo) because of the history that Juul's founders have with Heat-Not-Burn tobacco and marijuana vaporizers.\u000a\u000aJust tossing this article out there, btw, mainly because some seem to think Juul just popped-up out of nowhere as [an instant success](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Du1XMwZWoAEMfe-.jpg:small). I have no idea whether the Altria/Juul alliance will be good or bad for us.

aVThe Vype is the quarter of the price of a Juul and does the same thing, but better !\u000a\u000aIf you want to checkout the video for this Review it will be under YouTube with the username Fumb Duck labelled as JUUL vs Vype ePen 3\u000a\u000aVYPE ePen 3 Review  is a Review I have wanted to do for awhile. Since vaping is so popular nowadays I would say it is appropriate to talk about them. I own a Kanger KBOX 200, a STLTH, and now a Vype ePen 3 and they are certainly excellent ways of quitting smoking or pursuing a really fun hobby. The JUUL is a great product and certainly does the job but in the video I will explain why the knock off vape brand Vype ePen 3 is actually so much better and blows great clouds. \u000a\u000aThe vape/ e-cigarette world has revolutionized the way we intake nicotine. With this vape review I am trying to help people save money on vapes especially JUUL's which I find overpriced. Vype ePen 3 does the same job and is almost a quarter of the price.  Vaping is continuing to grow and soon the JUUL will be obsolete. Lets help people quit smoking!

aVNot sure if posted already but you can get a free juul from their very own website (In the UK at least)\u000a\u000aHi guys,\u000a\u000aApologies if this has been posted already or is well known information but thought I'd let people know as I've only just seen this and got myself one!\u000a\u000aThe official Juul website is allowing you to generate a 20 referral code off a first purchase, obviously meant for new buyers. Fun fact is you can send the code to yourself, it states that your order has to be worth over 21 but at check out it doesn't give a shit and literally orders you a free Juul with 72 hour delivery (2.99 with 24 hour deliver).\u000a\u000aThis is your time to try out the Juul, can't go wrong with free!\u000a\u000aWon't link or anything as I imagine it's not allowed but I'm sure the Juul website won't be hard to find.\u000a\u000aHopefully this helps someone :-).

aVYou can literally make one yourself. Just click the 'refer a smoker' link at the top, make an account, email yourself the referral link and you're sorted.\u000a\u000aFree Juul, you can also do it again with another email account for pods lol.
p892
aVDon't worry mate, I think it's a UK thing only at the moment as the Juul starter pack is down to 20 and the referral code is for 20. In the US it's apparently $35 for the kit and the code is only $15 off I think.\u000a\u000aI don't think it's actually meant to let us UK people order it though because it's stating that the order has to be worth at least 21 for the code to apply but it lets you buy the 20 Juul with free shipping no problem lol.
p893
aVI tried doing the referall to buy a pack of pods, of course it didn't work so i contacted juul who told me i wasn't eligible for the referall program since i didn't make a purchase. Which makes no sense when its off your FIRST PURCHASE. basically juul sucks. (im in the U.S.)
p894
aVGood marketing from them. Get a free juul then spend heaps of money on the pods 
p895
aVmaybe, the only thing that has ever fixed it or my juul is chucking it at the ground really hard
p896
aVI totally see why they got rid of them.. sadly..\u000a\u000aI got a bunch of people into rebuildables with the Crown 1 rba, I just showed them how easy it was to build and the $5-6 cost of coils at my local B&amp;M did the rest. \u000a \u000aI recently just showed my friend that he could refill Juul pods, he then spent half an hour searching his house for empty pods to fill up.\u000a\u000a\u000a
p897
aVI lost my best friend to vaping. It started as a dare. It's safe, he told me, stop being so paranoid. He quickly became addicted and got written up for vaping at work in full view of horrified clients. But he couldn't stop. Vaping had taken hold of him. His marriage fell apart. All he'd do was vape and watch Rip Trippers. His family fell apart and his wife and kids left him. Before long he was homeless and giving blowjobs  for pods. Last week he passed away, naked and alone in a dark alley, Juul still in his mouth. \u000a\u000aVaping. Not even once.
p898
aVWhat did Altria just pay to bring smoking back, if the FDA and the politicians go that route.....? 70% of the ecig market now addicted to nicotine from Juul pods, in their way of thinking.\u000a\u000aHuge bonuses to Juul employees, suddenly all the backlash instantly disappears.\u000a\u000aWho wouldn't smoke Marlboros for $1M richer overnight?\u000a\u000aMan, I'm in the wrong business, tell you what.
p899
aVFor me the most significant event of the year was yesterday's deal for Juul, selling 35% of their shares to Altria for enormous amount of 13 Bil Us presidents.   \u000aAn unbelievable amount and some things to understand about the industry and big players  \u000a
p900
aVyeah, if you are a vaper and an employed at Juul, sure you'll have some nice profits. As for the industry in general, we'll have to see.
p901
aVnever used juul myself. but as it becomes more popular every day i guess i'm gonna try it soon haha  
p902
aV+1% of the stock market price for juul stocks each similar response
p903
aVI think what's going on is you're getting dry hits. This can happen with an array of mods, but most commonly with pod mods. Basically, the juice hasn't saturated fully before you take your hit; thus, causing that tickly/dry cough every few hits. Now, devices such as the Renova Zero have largely worked on this issue, but if you don't have this device, then you can always do some dry puffs on your pod before hitting it. Also, if you're using something like the Juul in which air bubbles constantly form around your coil, then flick the air bubbles until they rise to the top. That's not to say this will efface dry hits entirely, but you can do certain things to minimize its impact. Nonetheless, this is a super normal issue. With any device shift, there's a slight learning curb. Good luck!
p904
aVPicked up a Innokin EQ today\u000a\u000aI feel like I might be using it wrong. Left the sub ohm world last year for a juul because it was more manageable to carry around work, but I missed actual flavors so I came back and bought a pod system. I\u2019m using 70/30vg pg salt Nic juice 25MG. I feel like the vapor production is a lot less than the Juul. How am I supposed to be hitting it? MTL feels too airy and yields next to no vapor, but DTL yields a nice amount. 
p905
aVYeah even on boost mood, mtl doesn\u2019t yield as much vapor as the juul. DTL does. I\u2019m just not sure the best way is to use it
p906
aVfirst time buying one of these devices coming from a Juul, how often do you need to replace the coil and the pod? new to this type of system so the more detailed the information the better!
p907
aVJuul employees get a special $2 billion bonus from Big Tobacco giant Altria \u2014 to be split among its 1,500 employees\u000a\u000a
p908
aVJuul???\u000a\u000a&gt;Juul is receiving the lump sum payout as part of the deal and has decided to share it with its staff, one of the people said.
p909
aV#JUUL???\u000a\u000a#&gt;JUUL IS RECEIVING THE LUMP SUM PAYOUT AS PART OF THE DEAL AND HAS DECIDED TO SHARE IT WITH ITS STAFF, ONE OF THE PEOPLE SAID.
p910
aVExecs/VC shareholders will probably capture ~80% of that, which would leave 400mm split equally among let's say 1,450 people = $300k/person. Still pretty respectable, it's a huge bonus, and I'm happy for the employees who work there. Not sure how I feel about Juul literally being acquired by big tobacco, but I think we all knew this was coming. The future will be interesting, that's for sure. Easy to forecast that closed systems like the Juul will get through whatever regulations come down the pipe and open systems will be demonized, which would be an interesting reversal of the current trend.
p911
aVSeems like a respectable breakdown of potential payouts.\u000a\u000aJuul captured the market. People are upset about anything that isn't the independent vape shops winning, but... if it makes an more easily accessible alternative to smoking, that's safer in almost every way, it's hard for me to demonize that overall\u000a\u000aThe hard part is the regulations that will inevitably come to try to crush independent providers, funded by companies like Altria, and I'll fight that tooth and nail. \u000a\u000aBig money boosts the most accessible ecig on the market, employees make a fair amount of money, shitty things could happen.\u000a\u000aIt's hard to say exactly what will come of this, but I think the community that has come behind the ideal of ecigs will come together to make sure they don't get fucked by regulations and corporations.\u000a\u000aFreedom in the market of ecigs is important af to people in this community, and that's like a cross culture bipartisan type of thing that almost anybody can get behind. \u000a\u000aIt's always going to be a tough road ahead for such an incredibly life changing technology, but I'm hopeful for the future!\u000a\u000aCheers, and purest white clouds to you!
p912
aV1.33 mil an employee? According to the title at least. I need a job with Juul it seems. I'm lucky to get a $100 bonus where I'm at now. 
p913
aVSome kids just showed me their juul and I was amazed to find out that they have little packs of like 1ml that they buy for 3$ each .  that is insane \U0001f635 even compared to vape juice which typically is marked up 1000 percent .
p914
aVBecause Juul is already almost everywhere cigarettes are sold and if they\u2019re not yet they will be soon. 
p915
aVAltira should have just kept trying by releasing new devices. They tossed 13 billion in the trash. Juul has already passed out 4 billion. They were about to go down the toilet. 
p916
aVI still will never understand why someone would want to buy a device and pods which are not meant to be refilled for more money than an open pod system. I'll never own a juul. 
p917
aVI mean think about it, what have you been hearing the last couple of months? Truth.com commercials singling juul out. Surgeon General coming out and saying teen vaping is a problem. All of this just mysteriously happened just before the acquisition. \u000a\u000aBig tobacco pays for the Truth Campaign because of an agreement from back in the day with the government. It was all an attack to lower the price of the company and make their acquisition that much easier. \u000a\u000aIt was all a sham and now Juul will bounce back heavily into the markets they said they were leaving. Don't be surprised if you see Juul in every gas station you can can think of in the next 5 years. 
p918
aVFaaaaar from a bad move. \u000a\u000aYou don't invest 13 billion with teams of people on a bad move. Big tobacco is a beast unlike any other and they will succeed in capitalizing on this opportunity. \u000a\u000aBig tobacco controls the truth campaigns. All of those anti Juul messages they have been producing... Yea that's going to change real quick. Wouldn't be suprised if we see "New Studies" promoting vaping and Juul use among adults trying to quit. All they have to do is market is as a cessation device. \u000a\u000aImagine if those commercials were pro juul instead of negative. That's a shitload of press that no other vape company has access to. 
p919
aV&gt; They were about to go down the toilet.\u000a\u000aJuul has 38 million untouched customers in the USA alone and *Altria has their addresses and phone numbers*.\u000a\u000aEvery pack of Marlboro's will now have a Juul ad inside the cellophane. Every Marlboro junk mail will have a Juul ad on it.\u000a\u000aOur industry tried, and failed miserably at converting the American Smoker. Several million people in a decade, and zero growth in the last 3 due to shops catering to vapers, instead of smokers.\u000a\u000aJuul and Altria are about to change that. Then they have 2 billion more customers across the globe to help.\u000a\u000aThis is a fantastic thing for tobacco harm reduction. Not so much for the vapor industry.
p920
aVNOBODY KNOWS. Why would you assume Juul would release exact numbers?
p921
aVThat's true. It helps that the Juul is more addictive than a normal vape (box mod or even open pod system), so they aren't losing any addicts, just making them live longer so they can buy longer. 
p922
aVJuul is already in all of the main gas stations I\u2019ve been in. Maybe not those tiny mom and pop ones, not every single one, but even those will have them sometimes. Problem was they\u2019d always be out of something like mango, most popular flavor. I\u2019m sure they will be well stocked now 
p923
aVThey will likely attach some sort of retaining clause to the bonus payout. Something like you must sign a contract to stay with JUUL for atleast 3 years to be eligible for the payout. \u000a\u000aThis also doesn't mean the payout has to happen all at one time. They could divvy it up so employees receive 3 $200,000 bonus's over the course of 3 years or something. 
p924
aVWhat really bothers me is how everything was engineered by big tobacco from those stupid parents to the media to tank Juuls value so they'd spend less acquiring them.\u000a\u000aI hope that rebuildables are still a thing in 10 years.
p925
aVI\u2019m talking about Juul flavors. \u000a\u000ahttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/health/juul-ecigarettes-vaping-teenagers.amp.html
p926
aVAh...But that's not just NY. I'm sure they'll be returning once everything is all settled and Juul has their new plan in place. They voluntarily pulled them rather than being forced to remove them by law.
p927
aVThe founders of Juul have been at this for a long time. Before Juul, there was Pax, before Pax, Ploom. I think they started working on their first "e-cig" about 13 years ago, before the first Chinese e-liquid vaporizers began to hit the US market.
p928
aV Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the whole reason JUUL let them buy was to stop the Truth adds... and all that antivape hysteria among politicians....\u000a\u000aIDC I just focus on me... as long as I can stay off the cancersticks.
p929
aVAlmost purely availability. I've been using an ecig for like 7 years now, but if I want juice or wire or whatever else I have to go *all* the way to the vape store and hope they have it in stock, or order it online and wait a while to get it. Meanwhile, if I want to use a juul I can walk into the store at the bottom of my building and they have like 50 devices and every single pod available. And theyre open 24/7. I've honestly thought about switching to Juuls a few times solely for that reason, and if I ever run into a situation where I run out of juice by accident or something, I probably will go grab one. 
p930
aVThey basically pioneered mainstream nicotine salts and pod systems, and jammed their products into retail stores rather than trying to sell through vape shops. They already had manufacturing and distribution connections through their parent companies products, not to mention the financial backing considering they were previously selling incredibly marked up weed vaporizers. 2 dollars worth of plastic and electronics for like 200+ dollars. One of the pax products is the same device as the Juul with a fillable pod you can put oils into. 
p931

p932
aVI haven't tried them but have done a lot of reading. Apparently they're much better than Blankz or Jpods for example. Also,  Bombies is pretty reputable so I'm sure they won't sell it if it was no good. \u000a\u000aI had been refilling the original Juul pods but stopped after a while since it was just easier with an open pod system. Also didn't like how every Juul pod vaped differently, they're inconsistent. 
p933
aVUsing the Sylo pod right now. I gotta say I\u2019m loving them. Life is about a week+, minimal leaking (way less than juul pods). Been searching for a coupon code but this thread answers my question. 3 of my buddies are waiting for a sale to purchase some. 
p934
aVPlease Help a Beginning Vaper\u000a\u000aI want to buy a new ecig and it needs the following things:\u000a\u000a- The amount of vapor and scent has to be around something like a juul. (Being able to adjust that would be cool)\u000a- IT CANNOT BE A POD SYSTEM\u000a- Size has to be small to medium.\u000a- Easy to maintain. (Low cost coils and easy to replace)\u000a- Has to be around $50\u000a\u000aIm relatively new to vaping and I've tried juul and the limitless pulse. Im tired of refilling the juul and having the limitless leak everywhere. I need something to hide from my family. Im tired of buying things im disappointed with. Thanks pals.
p935
aVThe survey is flawed in that after it asks if you have *tried* a Juul, it acts as though you answered that you currently use a Juul. I have literally only tried my friends, but I don't use a Juul regularly.
p936
aVYou are not asking about E-Cigs, you are only interested in Juuls.\u000a\u000aI get the suspicion that I don't like where this is going.
p937
aVYes I\u2019m interested in Juul, but if you\u2019re smoking anything else, you could always specify. 
p938
aVAlso I hope every user here checks your comment history and sees that you posted the same survey on r/juul under another account and then used this account to express excitement for the survey under the guise of being a different and totally non biased person
p939
aVYes I posted it there too, but had to make some changes to it, and the one who posted it was a friend of mine, since I\u2019m new here and didn\u2019t have enough karma to post it myself. I\u2019m posting it on this groupe because I\u2019d like to get a good amount of answers regardless if they\u2019re smoking Juul or not. 
p940
aVNobody smokes juul so I doubt you'd get any answers from someone doing the impossible, but I think at this point anyone who has taken the survey or read the comments have noticed your lack of understanding for the topic and your not so subtle bias towards the products and the community of people who use electronic cigarretes so regardless of what you say in regards to the other post, I think everyone here sees what's going on.
p941
aVTo get data on the use of e-cigs, specifically Juul, but it doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t smoke Juul.

aV(Advice) Not Sure What I Should Buy to Accomplish What I Want\u000a\u000aI started vaping with a single battery mod with an aspire clieto tank. I was able to run this at about 25 - 40 W and was fairly happy with this. \u000a  \u000aNext I felt obligated to upgrade for some reason, and bought a 220W TC mod and tried pairing it with several tanks/Decks (Cloud Beast, Valyrian, Dead Rabbit). I got good at building could but wasn't able to figure out how to get higher OHM coils without screwing up.\u000a  \u000aI got frustrated and went back to dip for awhile, then got into (currently where I'm at) pod systems. I've had a Juul, and Smok Infinix which are nice, but higher level nic salts make me feel tired and sick a lot of the time.\u000a  \u000aI just want a smaller device I can run at lower wattages with good flavor MTL. Maybe something with proprietary coils but the ability to maybe build my own later with another deck.\u000a  \u000aRight now I'm thinking of buying the Aspire Puxos 100w kit (comes with Aspire Cleito Pro tank).\u000a  \u000aCan anyone decipher my rambling and help me figure out what I want? Thanks
p943
aV&gt;  I've been using closed nic salt systems, currently using a smok novo\u000a\u000aThat's an open pod system. Closed is something like the Juul that's not meant to be refilled. It sound like you're looking for a MTL tank and mod...Not a pod system.
p944
aVVery Interesting Bit of Info about Juul's True Market Share from the Altria Announcement\u000a\u000a&gt;...JUUL has quickly grown both revenue and share, and today represents approximately **30% of the total U.S. e-vapor category**^1 ...  \u000a&gt;  \u000a&gt; ^1 *Includes open-and-closed systems across all trade channels; Source: Altria Client Services estimate*  \u000a    \u000ahttp://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/IROL/80/80855/Altria_12_20.pdf (page 2)  \u000a \u000aYet even today, the media is still pushing that 70% crap.
p945
aVNo. Both assessments are correct. The 70% figure comes from Nielsen STARS data which is collected across the c-store segment where JUUL, compared to other products like Blu, Vuse, etc. held that much market share. Open vapor has never been part of that data collection mechanism so if you put an estimate together (and it is just that, an estimate, as there is hardly any solid data on the open vapor space) then JUUL, as a single brand product compared to the huge variety of open vapor products, hold about 30% of the entire market space.
p946
aVI am aware of that. You're missing the point, which is that the people blathering about Juuls gigantic market share are not bothering to point out the limitations of their data. It creates the impression that Juul is the evil 800 pound gorilla that needs governmental restraint.
p947
aV&gt; They have 70% of everything outside of vape shops\u000a\u000aOh god. No, they don't. They don't have 70% of online. They don't have 70% of specialty retail. \u000a\u000aAnd no, it didn't happen over night, [Juul spent a couple years working on it](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Du1XMwZWoAEMfe-.jpg:small).
p948
aVAh, yes, that point wasn't quite clear from the post but I agree. They are huge but they aren't the majority share of all vapor sales. Just singled out as, contrary to most of open vapor, JUUL has been a much larger threat to the establishment and the regulatory and legislative areas.
p949
aVTHANK YOU. I didn't think I had to spell it all out. \u000a\u000aBtw, I think you're mistaken about the name of the Nielsen data you referred to. At least, I have never seen "STARS" data. It's AOC, or xAOC/C, afaik.\u000a\u000aThe Altria numbers are actually the first I've seen that account for all sales channels. Wells Fargo put out some estimates, but Bonnie Herzog breaks everything down in a weird way and it's difficult to get a straightforward "Juul has a 30% total market share across all channels" from her analysis. 
p950
aVCan someone eli5 why juul is evil? What have they done? Are they lobbying against vaping manufacturer? 
p951
aVThey have pretended to not be big tobacco while planning to be big tobacco the entire time. The media is in on it as well, and all of the "kids getting them" etc - Juul is the people who are the patsy/scapegoat for all the soccer-mom baiting news stories. That is the truth, no matter who denies it. They are what I just said they are. They are doing what I just said they are doing.
p952
aV &gt; In its release Thursday, Altria said Juul represented approximately 30 percent of the U.S. e-cigarette space, when factoring in online sales and products in specialty stores such as vape shops.\u000a \u000ahttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/20/reuters-america-update-3-altria-to-buy-12-point-8-bln-minority-stake-in-e-cigarette-company-juul.html
p953
aVYou wrote this:\u000a\u000a&gt;They have 70% of everything outside of vape shops\u000a\u000aLater you said:\u000a\u000a&gt;Consider online a vape shop.\u000a\u000aNow if we consider online stores to be vape shops, and tobacco outlets to be vape shops, and vape shops to be vape shops, then you're almost right: Juul has "70% of everything" outside of the massive market sector you call VAPE SHOPS. Except, VAPE SHOPS also sell JUUL. In fact, JUUL DOT COM is a VAPE SHOP. So you're still wrong.
p954
aVNo, you seem to "need" to be right, but you're not. And I am forced to tell you that because you are trying to tell me what I said, when you did not repeat back to me what I said.\u000a\u000aMoving on: The vast majority of people vaping are *not* using the products that we are using. They are not frequenting this subreddit. They are not even looking at vaping related things online at all. They are buying from the same places they always bought their cigarettes.\u000a\u000aOf those places, Juul is running 70%. The end.
p955
aVWouldn't it be easier if you just used the proper terminology, instead of insisting on your own special definitions? Juul has 70% share in physical mass market retail stores. That market segment does not include online stores, vape shops or tobacco outlets. When you include them, and consider the vapor market as a whole, Juul ends up with a 30% share. In other words, 70% of everything is NOT JUUL.\u000a\u000a
p956
aVNot really. Tobacco outlets aren't vape-specific, and there a lot of those. My first setup came from a tobacco shop. Even today, the tobacco shops in my area offer a wider variety of small, high-nic MTL vape gear than the vape shops. Smokers don't like change and they are 99.999% small high-nic MTL already. \u000a\u000aThe availability of Juul in the mass retail market will soon increase by over 250% in the US alone. Altria's direct marketing will further expand Juuls share. US importers and sellers of Juul &amp; Juul pod knock-offs will come under greater pressure from the courts and the ITC. Gottleib will further restrict online sales. PMTA probably isn't a big concern for Juul anymore but for most everyone else it's game-over.  \u000a\u000aVape shops that don't offer smokers a better alternative than 6mg freebase and bulky, overpowered, direct-lung gear will become increasingly irrelevant. Then maybe those who seem to want it will get their "70% Juul" stat. But for now, 70% of every vape dollar goes to Juul's competitors. I would like to see the non-Juul share grow but I'm afraid it's just going to keep shrinking and being shrunk.
p957
aVMine did, too. It was never a concern for Juul. Juul has been altria before it was on paper. Juul was the TROJAN HORSE, my friend. Only in hindsight (2020) will people actually admit that, and I'll still be doubted until then. And it will be too late then: They will have mass manipulated this, and pretty much already have, to the point of no return.
p958
aV&gt; Juul has been altria before it was on paper. Juul was the TROJAN HORSE, my friend.\u000a\u000aAm I supposed to go on your word? I realize there are many plausible scenario's where this is a marriage made in hell but there are many others where it's just a symbiotic business alliance between two parties with a common enemy.  
p959
aVThere are only two sides here: Big Tobacco/Government Overreach and Vaping is the other side. Juul is quite obviously not on "vaping" side. I have been telling this sub over and over again for a very long time. I keep saying "next will be this". I get  disbelieved and doubted, and then what I said happens. I just told you all 2 months ago that within two months Juul will be partnered with Big tobacco. And I was downvoted and trash talked. And then here we are, 2 months later - like clockwork. I can not predict repeatedly each of their moves if I didn't see what they were doing. Keep posting news here, and I will read it, and Iwill tell again what they are doing - then I will be downvoted and doubted, probably by their own fucking employees and shills, so that no one else believes me, and then they get their way anyway.\u000a\u000aPeople need to wake up: This is NOT some regular product and competition. This is a way AROUND the high taxation and health problems and people are just letting Juul, on BEHALF OF BIG TOBACCO, FROM THE VERY START, BEFORE ANY OF THIS BECAME NEWS, BEFORE ANYONE EVEN STARTED TALKING ABOUT JUUL IN THE MEDIA ABOUT KIDS AND SHIT LIKE THAT, BEFORE ALL OF THAT, vapers are just letting juul take the industry and hand it right over to the same SHIT the industry was INTENDED TO END.\u000a\u000aWE HAVE BEEN HIJACKED. FACT.
p960
aVJuul's founders have partnered with big tobacco in the past (Ploom / JTI) and they've flat-out said they'd do it again, so no big surprise there. They started out as a heat-not-burn tobacco company, after all.\u000a\u000aBut like I said, I'm undecided. Your Magic 8-Ball and Caps Lock key isn't going to persuade me otherwise. So unless you've got evidence of Juul's long running collusion with Altria and the FDA, I'm going to watch and wait. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STkNPnovDV8
p961
aVKid, go smoke your juul.\u000aIf you can\u2019t see what\u2019s happening, then wake up.  Yeah, no shit it\u2019s made for adults.  No shit it\u2019s the vapes shop responsibility to sell to legal age customers.... I never said it wasn\u2019t.  And yes, IMO, the juices that are packaged and have labels that look like candy/cereal/donuts  are plain stupid... along with the customers who buy them.
p962
aVIt's official. Tobacco company Altria takes 35% stake in jUUL.\u000a\u000aThis values the company at $38 Billion\u000a\u000a[From CNBC] (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/20/altria-takes-stake-in-juul-a-pivotal-moment-for-the-e-cigarette-maker.html)\u000a\u000a\u000aNot exactly unexpected.
p963
aVThat's probably a good move for both Altria and Juul.\u000a\u000aAltria gets to diversify in a direction that's not as dependent upon combustible tobacco products, while Juul gets the benefit of backing from a company that has experience fighting against the tide of "for the kids" legislation and lawsuits.
p964
aVI think this is a good thing.  Altria will have a very strong legal defense for JUUL which could help push back legislation and laws against vaping.
p965
aVAnd now we will cease to carry Juul in our shop and online.
p966
aVSounds like a kneejerk reaction TBH. I don't even like JUUL but I see this as a positive development for vaping.
p967
aVI don\u2019t know about the second part. Although I agree with you\u2014 I would be more apt to view it through the lens that the media stuff was part of a strategy to get the price Altria had to pay lower and make Juul more willing to sell
p968
aVJust google Juul
p969
aVSo you think JUUL wants to do away with JUUL?
p970
aVBasically Juul is getting all the blame for the teen vaping "epidemic"
p971
aVAbout 6 months ago, Juul was valued at $16 Billion. Altria just bought 35% of the company for $12.8 Billion on a valuation of $38 Billion. So it doesn't seem like Altria did a very good job of driving the price down - it more than doubled in less than 6 months. \u000a\u000aOn the other hand, at least one early investor in Juul said (at the time of the $16 Bln valuation) that he expected Juul to grow to a value of more than $60 Bln in a couple years, and I've seen reports that other investors have refused to sell their shares on a valuation of $32 Bln.
p972
aVLol @ the morons downvoting you. They're either shills or are to moronic to understand how Juul just got played by a smear campaign.
p973
aVThey're interested in the tech, not the brand, though it will make them money for the time being. Big tobacco has been on a smear campaign ever since they realized vapers don't want their shitty products. That's why Juul is such a big market player. Take them down a few rungs, go from buying 25% to a larger stake, and start to cannibalize. They can destroy the brand and launch their own similar products.\u000a\u000aIf Apple were to magically vanish tomorrow their user base wouldn't simply stop using smartphones. They'd take the next best option. Something similar to what they had 
p974
aVAltria owns prime shelf-space in over 230,000 retail locations US, and has a huge direct marketing network. If you were ever a Marlboro customer, you probably already know about that. I still get birthday coupons. Coupons for Mark Ten arrived in my mailbox every month until Altria discontinued the product at the request of Juul. There will be Juul ads in Marlboro's.\u000a\u000aIf you're making an ethical stand I can respect that, but if you're trying to hurt Juul, you're not.
p975
aVSo is this why Altria killed MarkTen? Ridiculous. I was comfortable with that, and I dont want a JUUL. 
p976
aVWell I guess juul is safe now.
p977
aVNo not like that. I think the government in the USA wants to do away with Juul and other systems that look like a Juul. :p
p978
aVI have almost no knowledge in this field but If a $38b value is correct, I\u2019ve got to think that pax has to be one of the fastest growing companies on record yeah? Going from maybe a couple million from vaporizer sales before the juul to almost $40b in 5 or less years. Crazy. 
p979
aVAnd you all downvoted me when I told you this was their next move. Juul is a PATSY working against the same industry they are merely PRETENDING to be on our side about. ACCEPT IT. IT IS A FACT. DAMMIT.
p980
aVAltria has had a history of defending vaping in the past (see: regulations), but I wouldn't necessarily consider it for the right reasons.\u000a\u000a[Source from 2016](https://www.vapingpost.com/2016/07/19/altria-urges-fda-to-ease-on-regulations/)\u000a\u000aThey're probably more forward-thinking than others, but again, I wouldn't consider them an ally. They are a tobacco company first, and purchasing a stake in a separate company using a safer mechanism doesn't forgive them of their past nor does it paint them in a better light. They had the money being part of a monopolized industry, and didn't take the initiative when they had the opportunity. But this could go for any BT company releasing a cigalike when this industry started hurting their profits.\u000a\u000aI can put it this way: their MarkTen is arguably one of the better options out there compared to other cigalikes like Blu, et al, but they and other companies never really nailed the formula like Juul did. So they instead decided to partner up, in a way. If you can't beat them, join them. They purchased Greensmoke and shut them down, by the way. So, who knows what could happen.\u000a\u000aIt doesn't look good for Juul either, but whether that's relevant to the thread is up to interpretation. How it looks now could be much worse, or much better a year, or two years from now.\u000a\u000aI personally don't see anything good out of it, even if they are forward-thinking compared to the rest.
p981
aVAs someone who had job offers at JUUL last year, I\u2019m kicking myself today.\u000a\u000a2B in bonuses and huge jump in the valuation.... I\u2019m about $300k poorer than I would be.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m going to go take a cold shower and cry. 
p982
aVThe teen vaping market is mostly made up of juul users though. 
p983
aVThey purchased Greensmoke and shut them down...\u000a\u000aActually, you could say Juul shut down Mark Ten and Greensmoke. Shutting them down was a condition of the sale.
p984
aV&gt;Non-pod based systems make up a small fraction of the market.\u000a\u000aNot true. Juul has only about 30% of the total vapor market. As far as I can tell, no one knows what percentage of the total market is owned by Juul + all other pods combined, but it's not very likely to be enough to leave only "a small fraction" for everything else. \u000a
p985
aV[Where are you getting your figures](https://www.journalnow.com/business/juul-expands-top-u-s-e-cig-market-share-traditional/article_9bdfd55c-68b5-5c08-aeb8-edb4a616ca9e.html) son?
p986
aV I believe - and I may very well be wrong - that Juul separated from Pax a couple years ago to form it's own entity. Not sure if it bought itself from Pax or is Pax is still the parent company.
p987
aVJournalnow is using Nielsen xAOC/C data that comes from checkout scanners at selected convenience stores, gas stations, drug stores, and other mass retailers. Nielsen xAOC/C does not count online, vape shop, and tobacco outlet sales. Juul is not well-represented in those channels. Other pod systems are, but I doubt very much they outsell more 'advanced' vaporizers, atomizers, etc. at vape shops and online, and in any event, not to the extent that the more advanced gear would only make-up a 'small fraction' of the total.  \u000a\u000ahttps://old.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/a80mo4/very_interesting_bit_of_info_about_juuls_true/\u000a\u000ahttps://old.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/a1jgse/please_stop_spreading_misinformation_re_juuls/
p988
aVYeah, some investors made a bundle when Juul split from Pax, and they've been rolling in it ever since. Say what you will about Bowen and Monsees, they know how to make products that people want - Japan Tobacco, Altria, poor slobs like us.
p989
aVBro so many people have quit smoking cigarettes because of Juul. Are you seriously implying Juul just got everyone hooked just to sell out and have everyone go back to cigs? 
p990
aVYour shop, your call, but I wish vape shops around me would carry the it. I live in an adult signature state and only Juul seems to be following that law. I'd much rather spend my money at a vape shop than a gas station. I'd be great to make a stop, pick up some pods for the stealth vape and some bottles and coils for the mods. Heck, I need to replace my 18650s so I could grab one or two those and eventually replace the whole batch. But, what happens? My vape shop told me that they'd no longer be selling the pods, so I bought their remaining stock and now I pick them up at the gas station when I get gas and order my other vaping supplies online. I try to tell myself to go by the vape store and support them, but now it feels like a special out-of-my-way trip. I should be better at supporting a local store.\u000a\u000aVape shops are also much better at checking ID and that might cut down on some of the negative press that's affecting the vaping industry as a whole. I respect that a vape shop owner has the right to decide what products they carry, but this seems like leaving money on the table to me. 
p991
aVHell, I've bought every mod I've ever owned for less than $50, and many kits for around $40. I buy on sale.\u000a\u000aI bought a Juul a few months back to use during a hospital stay after surgery (because it was spinal surgery and going outside to vape was not an option). It was cheaper in my local area than other options.
p992
aVDude, can you imagine how pissed Altria employees are?\u000a\u000aI can.\u000a\u000aWhen the news came out that $2B was going to bonuses for Juul employees, and that we're going to layoff a boatload of people...\u000a\u000aThe CEO had a townhall on announcement day and someone asked about the Juul bonuses. Response was a literal minute of hems and haws followed by some platitudes about working for a start-up, and how these bonuses are the only way start-up employees get paid. Because obviously they're not getting good salaries already. /s\u000a\u000aOh well. At least the termination package seems half decent.
p993
aVFunny enough, those $2B in "bonuses" weren't exactly bonuses. They basically forced their employees to take cash in exchange for their shares of JUUL. Many JUUL employees were actually pissed about it because they thought the shares were worth more than the price they were getting for them.
p994
aVI want to get my brother something small and easy to use that he can carry in his pocket without worrying too much about leaking or anything. Something similar to a Juul or Suorin. He quit smoking so I'm looking for something that can use 0mg juice. Any suggestions?
p995
aVSomething tells me you\u2019re a Juul guy.
p996
aVAgreed. There's also aftermarket pods you can buy online if you don't like juul's flavors. 
p997
aVNever have, tho vaporesso has a decent rep.  Last year or so pods have exploded in popularity and options, mostly fed from juuls performance.  In that style i've used some (solid) but never owned get a good feel.   As is I see it, anything not refillable gives marginal health benefits while still fucking your wallet. 
p998
aVGood looking out. I gave my juul away and I'm down to try this at that crazy price
p999
aVSwitching from a JUUL\u000a\u000ai need recommendations for good juices in a 2-3 mg nicotine range (not salt juices). I'm getting bored/worried about the high nicotine strength in JUUL pods and now i want to switch back to a regular vape. Possibly without a menthol or mint flavor juice. Thanks everyone&lt;3
p1000
aVJuul sells 30% strength pods now too. Maybe still too strong for you?
p1001
aVBlu fucking sucks dude. I\u2019ve used vapes since 2009. I\u2019ve tried all of the new wave pod mod gas station vapes like blu, mark ten, vuse, juul, etc. and I got my blu device for basically free with a coupon and it was terrible. That juice is trash, I tried every flavor (again, it was free). It was better than some stuff I got back in the day, so I can see how someone new wouldn\u2019t mind it, but then again there are much better choices available even at the gas station currently. 
p1002
aVThanks for the feedback! I did try Juul first and it gave me a perpetual sore throat, so I went to Blu after that. I guess there are 2 reasons this works for me- first, I lose everything constantly, so if/when I misplace any of the parts it isn\u2019t a huge expense to replace them, and it\u2019s very convenient to just drive right over to Walgreens. Secondly, I\u2019m afraid that if I get into a really amazing vape it will distract me from my goal, which is complete smoking/vaping cessation. I\u2019ve been off cigarettes for over 2 months now, which is a record since I took up smoking again 6 years ago.\u000aCheers!
p1003
aVI know they do, but I just want to get away from juul completely since they\u2019ll only have two flavors left after all their other ones are sold out
p1004
aVDiscovered a free Juul offer for UK members\u000a\u000a[removed]
p1005
aVlinks to sites that sell juice (which juul does) is not allowed reddit wise. those mods on that sub are asleep at the wheel. I'll send them a message. it's also a referral link which i'm not sure is allowed either.
p1006
aVGood to know!! I figure it would have to be a big money-maker or blatantly labeled as vape related to be red-flagged and investigated. \u000a\u000aThe share grab for juul has me a little worried that they are gonna crack down hard soon.\u000a\u000aGlad to hear your opinion on this subject! \u000a\u000aIt\u2019s really sad that most all manufacturing of new vape stuff within the US has been halted. \u000a\u000aI would prefer to buy local and support the US economy more but sadly things turn out differently. 
p1007
aVDepends on the pod system. Some can\u2019t absorb the thickness of CBD oil; some can. For example, the Juul can handle CBD oil, so as long as you ensure the wicks are already saturated by E-juice.

aVWSJ: Altria Nearing Deal to Take 35% Stake in Juul [at $38 B valuation = 12.8 B Cash infusion]\u000a\u000ahttps://www.wsj.com/articles/altria-is-nearing-a-deal-to-take-a-35-stake-in-juul-11545242422?tesla=y&amp;mod=breakingnews\u000a

aVCNBC now saying the deal has been approved by Altria's board and will formally be announced tomorrow before 9:30am EST.\u000a\u000a&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/19/juul-altria-boards-approve-altrias-13-billion-investment-in-juul.html\u000a\u000aThis is interesting:\u000a\u000a&gt;...Negotiations between Altria and Juul began to heat up in October...One of the obstacles was Altria's own e-cigarettes, MarkTen and GreenSmoke, which Altria agreed to shut down as part of the deal...\u000a\u000aAt the time, Altria blamed lackluster sales. Commenters here suggested government regulation and public relations may have played a role. Little did we know...\u000a\u000aMakes me a little more suspicious of that Chronos deal as well.
p1010
aVHonest question: why? I'm not well-versed in supply chain logistics, but I can only imagine that with JUUL controlling so much of the market, suppliers are only selling so many of this one particular model of product.
p1011
aVI'm giving up on mine....I haven't had the issues mentioned, but the pods are garbage. \u000a\u000aThey are really good for about 2 fills. Then dry hits, spitback, etc becomes the norm. So much so you just don't want to use it. I've given it enough tries with different patches of pods, all the same.\u000a\u000aToo bad, as when they are new it's great.... great battery life, everything.\u000a\u000aBut a waste. I can refill a Juul pod 5-6x and not have these issues. 
p1012
aVThat makes a lot of sense. The confusing thing is that I\u2019ve never had a issue with other salt nic juices like juul. But it\u2019s been along time since I\u2019ve used one. I\u2019ve been vaping 6mg for the past year but wanted something I could use easier at work without having to take 6 or 7 big drags in order to get my fix. 1 or 2 puffs and I\u2019m done, only issue is I feel like a Asthma patent for a few minutes afterwards. 
p1013
aVThere are quite a few different acids used for synthesising base into salt nic.  Maybe you are allergic to this particular form of salt nic.  You can check the juul patent to find out how they synthesise their salt nic and maybe check with your juice supplier what this recent juice is.\u000a\u000aI hope this helps...Cheers :) 
p1014
aVYes, IMO that's too high. Devices like the Juul and MiPod are like 5-7 watts.
p1015
aVLooking for something portable and convenient after semi-quitting smoking.\u000a\u000aHey so i have been smoking for 6 years (started way too young) and recently started smoking a lot less, i went from 4 packs a week to between only a few cigs to a max of 2 packs, i pretty much only smoke when i\u2018m out drinking on the weekend, meet some certain friends or after an exam or something really stressful. But i stopped smoking when i\u2018m alone, which already was a huge step and pretty much lead to me not smoking on almost half of the days since then.\u000a\u000aA good friend gave me his old mod to totally quit, but i gave it back after a few days because it was to inconvenient and bulky for me. So i started looking around a bit, and realized a Juul would be perfect; but it\u2018s illegal in Germany.\u000aWe got laws here stating that a) anything containing nicotine can only have a maximum of 10ml and b) anything up for sale for consumers can have a max of 24mg/ml of nicotine.\u000a\u000aSo what device should i be looking for, it should be about the size of a Juul, have an internal battery, last me through a night out and give me about an equal amount of nicotine as a cig does with 24mg/ml.
p1016
aVLook at the SMOK NORD. 40 bucks bigger sized refillable pod system. Has it's own push in style coils that can use reg ejuice or salt nic. I have had alot of things and recently bought and tried a Juul. I like it but I'm not interested in spending $16-$20 on pods a week. USB chargeable and 1100 mAh battery. \u000aGood luck
p1017
aVI really tried to read this article, I swear.\u000a\u000a&gt;The survey also found that many students believe they are vaping \u201cjust flavoring.\u201d In fact, just about all brands include nicotine, and Juul has particularly high levels of it.\u000a\u000aThat's such an impressive spin on "this is the only line in here that even *suggests* nicotine might not be involved in all cases and we're going to dismiss it out of hand" that I had to admit defeat.
p1018
aVUgh, NYT. Whatever I'll give them a fair shake.\u000a\u000aAs a disclaimer, I don't endorse underaged vaping. However, this authoritarian streak in our society, and this constant helicopter parenting, is getting out of fucking hand. So -\u000a\u000a&gt;A Harvard addiction medicine specialist is getting calls from distraught parents around the country.\u000a\u000aYeah I bet. The first thing parents think when they catch their kids vaping is "OMG. BETTER CALL HARVARD."\u000a\u000a&gt;public health experts are struggling to address a surging new problem: how to help teenagers quit vaping.\u000a\u000aYou mean "how to make teenagers quit vaping", "how to help teenagers do what we want them to do."\u000a\u000a&gt;the pervasiveness of nicotine addiction among teenagers who already use the devices is now sinking in \u2014 and there is no clear science or treatment to help them stop.\u000a\u000aYes there is. It's called stepping down the nicotine level until you're at 0. It takes a while, but it's more effective than trying to lolwillpower it. But y'know that require everyone to take the stick out of their ass, lighten up a bit, and not freak the fuck out, so the teen could potentially carry a different style of vape that would allow him to step down the nicotine over time. Assuming he actually even wants to.\u000a\u000a&gt;\u201cNobody is quite sure what to do with those wanting to quit, as this is all so new,\u201d\u000a\u000a"Those wanting to quit" = parents who want their kids to quit.\u000a\u000a&gt;said Ira Sachnoff, president of Peer Resource Training and Consulting in San Francisco, which trains students to educate peers about smoking and vaping.\u000a\u000aDoubly disgusting: Spreading lies to one set of students by using another set of students they've trained to be patsies. Gross.\u000a\u000a&gt;\u201cWe are all searching for quit ideas and services for this new nicotine delivery method. It is desperately needed.\u201d\u000a\u000aAre you implying that traditional ways of quitting nicotine.... are ineffective? HMMM.\u000a\u000a&gt;The survey also found that many students believe they are vaping \u201cjust flavoring.\u201d In fact, just about all brands include nicotine, and Juul has particularly high levels of it.\u000a\u000aYes because teenagers are known for their honesty when dealing with adults amirite? Like. The student hits the vape and gets a huge nicotine buzz... but he thinks it's just flavorings, right? lol Idiots.\u000a\u000a&gt;Over all, 3.6 million middle and high school students are now vaping regularly, according to a government study released last month.\u000a\u000aToo bad the CDC is paid by Big Tobacco. :(\u000a\u000a&gt;The brain\u2019s prefrontal cortex, which affects judgment and impulse, is still maturing. \u201cWhen you flood it with nicotine, you are interrupting development,\u201d Dr. Picciotto said.\u000a\u000aPicciotto is patently wrong. "Interrupting" development. Pffft.\u000a\u000a&gt;Psychiatrists say that nicotine can exacerbate underlying mental health conditions; it can also lead to hyperactivity, depression and anxiety.\u000a\u000aNo, actually, nicotine is *beneficial* for these conditions.\u000a\u000a&gt;Now Mrs. Debono resorts to home kits for random nicotine testing.\u000a\u000aYour youngest kid is 17 years old. **SEVENTEEN FUCKING YEARS OLD AND STILL RECEIVES AN ALLOWANCE**. Like really. **SEVENTEEN FUCKING YEARS OLD AND BEING _NICOTINE TESTED_ BY MOMMY.**\u000a\u000aFolks vaping isn't the problem in this case. It really really isn't.\u000a\u000a&gt;Unfortunately, methods for quitting cigarettes can\u2019t be grafted onto vapes. While cutting down on daily cigarettes can include simple math \u2014 cutting back, say, from the 20 cigarettes in a pack to 18 to 14 and so on \u2014 an analogous method doesn\u2019t readily apply to vaping.\u000a\u000aYes... it's called going from 9 to 6, from 6 to 3, etc etc...\u000a\u000a&gt;Vicki, a mother in suburban Boston who requested that her last name be withheld to protect the family\u2019s privacy, asked her pediatrician for suggestions for her son, 17, who has long been trying to give up Juul. The doctor recommended several addiction centers. \u201cThey were all for adults!\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aLOL Sent to rehab for vaping, **HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA**.\u000a\u000a&gt;Mr. Hirsch said that although instilling a fear of disease can be a successful tool to prevent cigarette smoking, using fear to intercede with students already vaping does not work. Faced with losing their devices \u2014 their nicotine \u2014 they become furtive or lash out. One parent took away his son\u2019s vape, Mr. Hirsch said, and the boy got so worked up that he punched a tree and broke his hand.\u000a\u000aYeah who woulda thunk that interfering with a soon-to-be-adult's autonomy would cause pushback.\u000a\u000a&gt;When patients taunt, asking if she prefers that they smoke cigarettes\u000a\u000aFrom the mouth of babes!!!!\u000a\u000a&gt;Dr. Tanski discusses the potential harm of the particles and chemicals in a vape\u2019s aerosol, which can harm the airways. \u201cI\u2019ll say, \u2018We know a lot of bad stuff now about tobacco, but it took so long for those diseases to develop and for us to learn about them. I\u2019m not willing to do this experiment on you.\u201d\u000a\u000a95-97% less harmful than cigarette smoke.\u000a\u000a&gt;Dr. Sharon Levy, an adolescent addiction expert at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, will do \u201cmotivational interviewing\u201d \u2014 educating teenagers so they will want to quit vaping for their own sake, **not just to get parents off their backs.**\u000a\u000aAnd there it is. This one little slip up reveals it all. It's not teens *wanting* to quit, it's the **parents** wanting them to quit. It's the **teachers**.\u000a\u000aAnyone remember smoking in highschool, or other kids smoking in highschool? Did anyone freak out "omg I'm addicted and I can't stop, omg I need to quit, mommy, daddy, help me please, I need therapy!!!!"\u000a\u000aI sure as fuck don't. Actually it took me several years to become addicted to nicotine to the point where I was physically unable to stop when I wanted to.\u000a\u000aThis whole article is sensational, and makes a mountain out of a molehill. 17 year olds being sent to rehab for vaping, still receiving allowance from their parents, and getting nicotine tested by mommy - what the actual living fuck? The problem isn't teens doing what teens have always done. It's the increase in authoritarian schooling and parenting (wrapped under the guise of "being your friend, and having your best interests in mind"). I mean, shit, they're even training other students to be informants and spread propaganda and lies! Sickening, absolutely sickening.
p1019
aVThat's why they're attacking Juul, all the big tobacco companies have a brand of gas station E-cig (Vuse and the like) they just suck compared to Juul, hence Juul is the choice of young and old vapers alike and has huge market share. That's why all the focus is on Juul despite brands like Vuse predating it and being just as accessible to minors (first vape I ever got was a Vuse in like 2013 when I was underage), they are in my opinion manipulating the media to smear their competitor while they work to secure favorable regulations. 
p1020
aVI mean. Juul *is* a travesty. I don\u2019t understand why vapers at large are supportive of a company that seeks to deliver large doses as efficiently as possible.\u000a\u000aThat *is* pushing, and it reflects poorly on the rest of us. Their product and, by extension, their business model are 100% centered around getting and keeping you hooked, and ideally to the exclusion of other vapor products.
p1021
aVI don't feel that nicotine is that addictive when not found amongst other chemicals and carbon monoxide. The CO may not be euphoric per se but I think it's partially responsible for the dizzy feeling that cigarettes can sometimes give. I know for a fact that in the 80s researchers started adding chemicals to cigarettes that made rats increase their dosing frequency (they were ironically trying to find chemicals to make cigarettes less harmful to health). There are also MAOIs in combustibles as well. \u000a\u000aI can't break for a vape at work very often. If I was still smoking I'd be fiending for a cigarette all day with only the one break per shift. I also keep using 3 mg juice in my Vapes and I dislike the strong nicotine levels in my pod system (I only use that for stealthy Vapes in certain instances). \u000a\u000aIf these kids are truly as addicted to a juul as people get with normal cigarettes, then I strongly feel that there's an additive in juul pods we don't know about or understand (sorry for the tinfoil hat conspiracy theory). I don't think this is the case though. 
p1022
aVI was mostly talking in the scope of how adolescence vape. Almost all highschoolers who vape use juuls, which only have only one concentration. That is true though I overlooked that.
p1023
aVCertainly, but that's what all the other gas station brands do? Vuse has 0.5ml cartridges which are equivalent to a pack of cigarettes, but they don't say that anywhere on the package, they don't tell you the nicotine percentage or total mg of nic. \u000a\u000aJuul for all their problems is actually relatively transparent about the nicotine content and offers 3% and 5% cartridges which are 2ml. So compared to big tobacco's offerings Juul is actually less concentrated per hit and tells you what their nicotine content is.
p1024
aVCan I smoke cbd e-juice in a vape pod system (juul, soarin, minifit) if so what PG/VG ratio should I buy?
p1025
aVMy gf is looking for a Juul sized device for portability but would like to have it refillable. Any suggestions? Was looking at some stuff from OVNS. Anyone have any of these?
p1026
aVYou can buy refillable pods the fit the JUUL, they are the same pods for OVNS.  All pod systems are lower powered with a very small coil, this is why they use nic salts with such a high nic content, 35mg to 50mg.  The amount of nicotine that you get per drag is pretty low as a result and not anywhere near as scary as the media would like us to think.  If you check the side bar for Anthony\u005c_Vapes recommendations he has plenty of other pod systems on there. I've had good luck with the Mi-Pod and the Suorin Air myself. I've heard really good things about the Innokin EQ also.
p1027
aV1. The whole appeal of nic salts is that you can get high mg nic without the harsh throat hit. To me, a 12mg freebase seems about the same as a Juul pod which is 59mg salt nic. I am using 12mg freebase at 50/50 pg/vg in my pods, you can use freebase in them as long as the pg/vg ratio is around there. Too much VG and it won't wick quick enough, giving burnt hits. Too much PG and the pods will leak. \u000a2. Yes, definitely. Some pods are very muted, and some have very good flavor for MTL. It won't compare to a top RDA or anything though but for the most part, good enough. 
p1028
aVI might need to get a new pod system or some juul pods. 
p1029
aVLooking for a good pod system for an older person\u000a\u000aMy uncle-in-law has been struggling with quitting smoking for a while now and I want to get him a pod system to see how that works for him. I figure that pods are good since they're easy to use and he's not tech savvy at all. Right now I'm going back and forth between the Innokin EQ and Vaporesso Renova since they seem to get good praise on here. Right now I'm leaning a little more towards the Renova because of the auto draw feature so he doesn't have to worry about using a button but I'm just wondering if anyone else has been in the same situation and has any other recommendations or advice. My only real requirement is that it's a refillable pod system (he wants to save money so I want to keep him away from closed pods like the Juul), so any input would be appreciated! 
p1030
aVIf he's older, I'm assuming he's been a long time smoker. Everyone's different but I find that something small and light like a cig helps a lot more. I have the Innokin EQ, Aspire Spryte, Juul, and Kwit stick pods. There's just something about the Juul and Kwit stick that I like a lot...it's the resemblance of a cig. The larger ones just don't feel the same. Something to ask him about.\u000a\u000aThe Kwit stick comes with prefilled pods but they are refillable. It is kind of annoying to refill though but not as bad as Juul. It is also made by Aspire which is good quality.\u000a\u000aThe Boulder Rock kit is another option, but it has a push button. It's only $10 and comes with a bottle of juice as well.

aVThe numbers come from the [2018 NYTS](https://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/PublicHealthEducation/ProtectingKidsfromTobacco/ucm405173.htm).  Note that there was a significant decline across all measurements from 2011-2017, but then suddenly *only* vaping had a huge spike in 2018.  That to me reads as a change in the survey that resulted in different answers from 2017 to 2018.  Or in other words, a manufactured data set in order to drive a desired narrative:\u000a\u000a&gt; "We have never seen use of any substance by America's young people rise this rapidly," Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said at the briefing. "This is an unprecedented challenge."\u000a\u000aAny scientist worth their degree would look at a spike like this and immediately question what's different.  A single company like Juul, as significant as they may be, is highly unlikely to be the single root cause.  More likely, a gap in the data exists, and this isn't a large spike but a misrepresentation, either that earlier years had the numbers wrong too low (possibly) or this year has the numbers wrong too high (more likely).\u000a\u000aThe fact that non-scientists are declaring an "epidemic" over this unverified data should tell us everything we need to know.

aVProbably cigarettes. \u000a\u000aTbh all these 14 year olds are picking up vaping for literally no reason and getting addicted to nicotine. They\u2019ll probably social smoke in college and are more susceptible to picking up cigarettes too \u000a\u000aI know most people on this sub started vaping back in its infancy like 5-6 years ago but now people are doing it just because. There\u2019s no reason for a 14 year old to own a JUUL

aV...14 year olds are picking up vaping for literally no reason and getting addicted to nicotine. They\u2019ll probably social smoke in college and are more susceptible to picking up cigarettes too....\u000a\u000a...There\u2019s no reason for a 14 year old to own a JUUL.\u000a\u000aIn the real world, people have reasons for doing things. They don't randomly start vaping, then buy a vaporizer just because it's there, then arbitrarily switch to cigarettes six years later. There is no magic gateway to cigaretteland that opens-up because a kid happens to walk by with a vape in his hand.\u000a\u000aWe can and do study the reasons people do things. We collect data that show these things happening and changing over time. There's no magical thinking required, until you start talking about the gateway effect. The data doesn't support it. There's no apparent reason why young people, who say they vape because it's healthier and cheaper and better-tasting than smoking, would suddenly switch to cigarettes when they get to college.\u000a\u000aWhy would they? Where's your evidence that they are?
p1037
aVI have not seen one single minor vaping indoors. The only under-18-looking person I've seen vape at all is a 17 year old cousin. I know some teens are Juuling it up, but not one indoors compared to tons of adults indoors and out.
p1038
aVI feel bad for saying it, but fuck juul. They need to do a little more to stop kids from buying those things. It looks really bad for the industry.

p1040
aVThe JUUL is great if budget isn't an issue and you're looking for pure ease-of-use and availability of pods. It's freakin expensive but does the trick. The proprietary connection is a bummer though, as you're in trouble if you lose the little baby charger it comes with.\u000a\u000aAs for MTL pods, I have tried a few and fallen in love with my SMOK Infinix. I'm floored that a SMOK product is any good (they've had a history of stinkers over the past few years) but the Infinix has been a grand slam for me. I even bought more than one so I can have one for high-nic during the day and another for low-nic at night. It's the closest to the same thin/long form factor as the JUUL, the pods are super easy to find (plus affordable), it charges quickly, and it's got the best flavor I've found. You can find the starter kit for like $15-20 online. I paid $18 minus a discount and the pods were $10/3-pack. You can do better on the pods buying through Fasttech but they are well-known for taking forever to ship since it comes direct from China.
p1041
aVLook at the Smok Nord. It's about 40 bucks. It's a salt nic and reg juice pod system but it's much bigger than a Juul. Feels good in the hand and not big in the pocket.\u000a\u000aSalt Nic more closely resembles the effects of real nicotine so it will be more satisfying to him. The Nord can also run sub ohm coils for regular juice as well. \u000a\u000aI've been vaping for about 5 years and I've done it all style wise and these days as I'm nearing the end of vaping I like this setup. No external tanks to break, 1100 mAh battery inside, USB chargeable and you can but separate pods to keep a variety of juice handy. \u000a\u000aGood luck!
p1042
aVIt's like that one\u000a\u000a "A SINGLE JUUL CONTAINS AS MUCH NICOTINE AS 20 ANALOG CIGARETTES"\u000a\u000aBecause yeah I'm just gonna go out and vape a whole JUUL pod
p1043
aVBut doesn't 1 JUUL pod roughly equal a pack of analogs in number of inhales? As a shop manager I need to know because this is information people ask for often.

aVIt continues to fire. I was wondering if there was a way to check the air flow detector but i cant push the case off like a juul.

aVhere is the text \u000a\u000a\u000a"Twice as many US high school students used electronic cigarettes this year compared with last year, an unprecedented jump in an annual survey of teen smoking, drinking and drug use.\u000a\u000aIt was the largest single-year increase in the survey\u2019s 44-year history, far surpassing a mid-1970s surge in marijuana smoking.\u000a\u000aThe findings, released yesterday, echo those of a US government survey earlier this year. That survey also found a dramatic rise in vaping among children and prompted federal regulators to press for measures that make it harder for kids to get them.\u000a\u000aExperts attribute the jump to newer versions of e-cigarettes, such as those by Juul Labs that resemble computer flash drives and can be used discreetly.\u000a\u000aTrina Hale, a junior at South Charleston High School in West Virginia, said vaping exploded at her school this year.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey can put it in their sleeve or their pocket. They can do it wherever, whenever. They can do it in class if they\u2019re sneaky about it,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aThis year\u2019s survey findings were based on responses from about 45,000 students in Years 8, 10 and 12. It found one in five high school seniors reported having vaped nicotine in the previous month.\u000a\u000aAfter vaping and alcohol, the most common substance used by teens was marijuana. About one in four students said they had used marijuana at least once in the past year. Overall, marijuana smoking was about the same level as it was the past few years.\u000a\u000aMore teens, however, are saying no to other drugs. Use of cocaine, LSD, ecstasy, heroin and opioid pills all declined.\u000a\u000aExperts said it was not clear what was behind the trends. \u201cWhat is it that we\u2019re doing right with teenagers that we\u2019re not doing with adults?\u201d said Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a federal agency.\u000a\u000aOne leading theory is that kids today are staying home and communicating on smartphones rather than hanging out and smoking, drinking or trying drugs. \u201cDrug experimentation is a group activity,\u201d Dr Volkow said."
p1046
aVI thought nicotine was an appetite suppressant, but it stimulates gastric juices. That\u2019s weird. \u000aGuess hitting a juul is good after a meal.
p1047
aVMy dude! Thank you for posting this!\u000aJust a few days ago I was super sick. Started with horrible stomach pain and diahrea. For 24 hours I was going to the bathroom every 30 minutes to try and relieve myself. The only thing that came out was bloody mucus.  I puked at like 5 am day two of sickness. \u000a\u000aAt day 3 it subsided and I went to the doctor. She had no idea and was happy it went away on its own and didn\u2019t do anything further... I thought it may have been from undercooked chicken. \u000a\u000aBut now I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s from nicotine my dude...\u000aI\u2019ve been using the juul and now the suorin drop, at 45-55mg nicotine....\u000a\u000aAfter I Vape I always have to poop. And I\u2019m really thinking that this high nicotine juice isn\u2019t helping my chronic stomach pain... I thought I was just lactose intolerant or had UC or IBS... \u000a\u000aI never thought that the nicotine could be causing me ulcers... 
p1048
aVOh yeah I swallow juice occasionally too. Didn\u2019t know that was as harmful as I\u2019ve been told it is.. \u000aI got my girlfriend to quit smoking cigarettes with the juul. And now I\u2019m going to see if she wants to quit the vaping with me too. \u000a\u000aAnd yeah the blood was red, not black coming out. So it probably want stomach bleeding, most likely internal hemmeroid. But starting the new year I\u2019m going to get s bunch of tests done for peace of mind ! Hopefully starting a plant based diet too if I can! I\u2019m only 22 but I feel really unhealthy! Time to change is now. \u000a\u000aI really think the nicotine salts are way overpowered than what we know. I puff on my drop for a few hits and instantly go poop. It\u2019s really got an effect on my stomach !
p1049
aVI\u2019ve noticed my stomach issues exacerbated since starting my juul vaping a year ago. I\u2019m thinking of just going back to 0-3mg regular juice out of a bigger vape pen like i used to. The amount of nicotine I\u2019m taking in is too damn high w the nic salts. 
p1050
aVMTL?\u000a\u000aI realize that this question is probably asked every day but I'm desperate :(\u000a\u000aI've gone through quite a few MTL devices recently and have been pretty let down from the hit of most of them.\u000a\u000aI found the Nautilus AIO too airy, and had constant coil/pod issues with the breeze 2/suorins, and have lost countless juuls.\u000a\u000aI just want something capable of handling nic salts, that will be reliable. I don't really have the budget for an Orion atm, and have been hearing good things about the Infinix, vladdin, Novo (or the nord I guess), and renova zero. Pls help me I'll love you forever
p1051
aVI think the draw is "maybe" about the same as a juul, but in a way the novo is more orally satisying because you can take bigger hits. And to me it's somewhat tighter than the breeze (the only other 2 mtls I've tried). As a recent ex smoker, I find the draw and vapor production to be sufficiently satisfactory. I use a 50/50 juice with 25-35 mg nic.
p1052
aVI meant to say about the same or a little looser than the juul.
p1053
aVLeading to smoking\u000a\u000aToxins\u000a\u000aJuul being marketed to children\u000a\u000aTo name three. 
p1054
aVI honestly have not had a hit satisfying enough worth replaying :-(  Maybe it\u2019s the juice? I had no problems with the one linked above in my Juul at all, I used it probably 90% of the time.
p1055
aVSo the juul and other pod mods I\u2019ve tried put out less of a hit than my Orion does. You can probably step down the nic level of your juice and still get the same overall amount of nic into your body overall, if that makes sense, I started with 24 in my Orion and I\u2019m happy with 12 now. 
p1056
aVIf you're still using 50mg with that like what your JUUL used, that's probably the cause tbh. I'd personally lower the nic to 25-35mg.
p1057
aVI used to fill Juuls with NKD 50 and it was fine. I used the same juice on the orion and noticed a much more harsh hit. I would drop to a lower nic level and maybe try a different brand as well. 
p1058
aVHey, not yet. I wanted to finish out my Hawaiian pog bottle out in my Juul pods before I started experimenting. I\u2019ve been to a bunch of different vape shops and while they haven\u2019t heard of the Orion all of them pretty much said the same thing, to drop the nic mg down to 35 from 50. So I\u2019ll be trying that along with a 70/30 mix instead of a 50/50.
p1059
aVinfinix is much closer to a juul or a Marlboro mark ten elite if you ever tried one of those. you can hold the device in your mouth like a cigarette. no buttons. pods id guess last a week or so? its not my main device so im not 100% sure. I usually keep a coffee / tobacco flavor in it for in the mornings when im having coffee. I like it. theyre cheap too.\u000a\u000anord MTL is on the loser side but its not too lose. once I got used to it I actually like it quite a bit. that's with the 1.4 MTL coil. you also have a 0.6 mesh coil for 3mg / 6mg type of vape. and also a new 1.4 ceramic coil which is somewhere in between the other 2. a little too loose for MTL but great flavor. that's what I have in both of mine right now. I do like the draw on the normal 1.4 MTL coil better though. it does have a button to fire and you replace coils, not the whole pod so its probably cheaper in the long run.\u000a\u000athe nord is much higher quality. I feel like the infinix could die randomly any day but for the past few weeks its been great. it just feels cheap.
p1060
aVI tried Salt Bae 50/50 in the .25 (new) pod too, it was around the same harshness. I can actually taste the nicotine on my tongue (that annoying peppery taste). I wonder if I just got a batch of bad pods or maybe I didn\u2019t prime them correctly? It\u2019s funny because the Charlie Noble juice you got was also 50/50. That new 80/20 6mg juice I got is extremely smooth in my Juul, I don\u2019t even feel it going down. Did you mess with any eScribe settings? I tried some recommended tips but it all honestly feels the same.
p1061
aVHaha I\u2019m getting to that point too. Why\u2019s it so hard to find something reliable? I just want a pod mod that I don\u2019t have to fill multiple times a day that works the way a Juul does and I don\u2019t have to keep on the charger.
p1062
aVI'm a Juul fiend but my wife uses a Breeze with .6 coils and 24mg salts. (70/30)  Check out Blue Dot for affordable salt liquids, but 24mg is as high as they go.

aVJuul Ruined Everything - Part 2: US Jobs\u000a\u000aI found this listing for jobs in the US with Juul Labs:\u000a\u000a&gt;https://www.indeed.com/q-Juul-Labs-jobs.html\u000a\u000aI see 344 full-time jobs in 15 US cities. I'd like to work in the vapor industry but not for Juul for god's sake they ruined everything. \u000a\u000aSo my question is, can someone find me a similar listing for jobs in the US with Innokin, Aspire, etc? \u000a\u000aOK, this is a shitpost, but RE: [Juul Ruined Everything](https://old.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/a6z1m3/juul_ruined_everything/) - let's not go haywire, Juul isn't the devil.
p1064
aVJuul didn\u2019t ruin everything. Cig companies did. 
p1065
aVDAMN! Thought I found one for a second. Turns out it was Juul again, looking for a [Quality Engineer](https://www.glassdoor.com/job-listing/supplier-quality-engineer-shenzhen-juul-labs-JV_IC2520983_KO0,34_KE35,44.htm?jl=3051830865&amp;ctt=1545101520321) for their operations in Shenzhen, China. \u000a\u000aThat's a tough fill. They'll probably have to do some head-hunting, and Shenzhen is not exactly a target rich environment, as we all know. Look for coil replacement packs to get even worse in the coming months.
p1066
aVIt's pointless. You're right but some vapers may as well be anti-vapers. They have the same attitudes about the same things. Juuls, candy flavors, bright packaging, vape clothing, anything gimicky, anyone vaping without smoking first or the intent to quit. We're our own worst enemy. Rather than standing up in defense of said things we toss them under a bus and agree with the anti-vapers out of fear. The attitude is "Maybe if we agree with them what I like will be safe" not realizing if you give in and give these people an inch they'll take a mile. It's not going to stop with just the things you don't like.
p1067
aVWe all have to be responsible, at least for appearances sake, because the long-term effects of vaping are still unknown, but to internalize the bullshit is beyond stupid. It's amazing there are morons who actually believe the propaganda. \u000a\u000a"Kids shouldn't vape," fine. But the latest numbers show that everyday smoking among HS seniors has dropped over 300% since vaporizers hit the market. Juul should be applauded for the part it played in that, not castigated. Yet "Juul Ruined Everything" was yesterday's top post, as if the FDA is the one acting responsibly.\u000a\u000aWhen Juul crawls to Atria for protection and enrolls in the MSA to satisfy the parasites in tobacco control, it will be someone else's turn, because as anybody with an ounce of sense knows, it was never about Juul in the first place.
p1068
aVSome big tobacco company lookjng to buy major stake in Juul? Rumor has it....
p1069
aVI'm affected also. \u000aLet's not bring in politics.\u000a\u000a\u000aJoe Camel?, the huge thinly disguised penis on the package? Then what's Juul's excuse? Or even Rogue Ale Dead Guy beer? Or even Cheetos with the Tiger? \u000a\u000a
p1070
aVIt\u2019s social pressure because Juul. Vaping in schools is a growing trend and they have no way to police it because it\u2019s easy to hide. But, the panic behind it is the real harm. It would be incredibly unpopular to remind people that nicotine and caffeine are both stimulants and nobody seems to care as much when kids ingest caffeine, but if we wanted to get real, a study would be done to compare those health impacts on kids. There\u2019s no way it happens, and the \u201cunknown long term impacts from vaping\u201d will always hang over our heads, but my point is the social pressures from schools and parents is enough to create the issue rather than any real health impacts.  The politicians are in a tough spot...politically. It sucks. 
p1071
aVReplacement for Juul Pods\u000a\u000aHi all, Anybody have any recommendations on oil comparable to Juuls?\u000a\u000aI love Juul, it's dope! What I don't love is the cost of the pods. They started out cheaper than cigs for me, which is why I liked them-- but then I turned into a pod a day smoker..\u000a\u000aSo I went ahead and got a mod/tank set up and have been smoking that for a bit. \u000a\u000aI've noticed since getting it and trying a few oils that it just doesn't hit me the same way juul does. It doesn't ever give me the same feeling and hits me better.\u000a\u000aThis isn't my first time trying mods, as a lot of my friends have them. I did some research and apparently Juul uses nicotine salts to make their oil and I've been buying those so far, but they just don't do the same thing, even with more of a nicotine percentage. \u000a\u000aThanks in advance!
p1072
aVThis is probably because of the salt nic that juul pods use vs freebase nic. Salt nic, at least to me, seems to feel more like a cigarette. I've heard of companies that make salt nic juices for sub ohm devices, or you could mix some yourself. 
p1073
aVI have to say, I don't know what it is but when I buy salt based liquids and fill my Breeze or Air devices with them, it's still not as good nicotine delivery wise, as Juul.  But it's pretty good for the price.
p1074
aVif i remember correctly, juul uses benzoic acid in addition to the nicotine salts to aid throat hit and nicotine absorption
p1075
aVThere are a few companies making refillable JUUL-compatible pods like Ref-Pod, J-Pod, or Blankz. You could buy some high-concentration salt nic and use it in those pods if you'd prefer to stick with JUUL. I've seen 45 or 50mg salts in a lot of vape and tobacco shops, or there's plenty of online vendors. I don't use JUUL or salts myself so I can't really recommend anything specific. \u000a\u000aThe other option is to up the nic level using salts in your sub-ohm setup. I wouldn't go anywhere near as high as  high as 45 or 50, maybe do like 12mg salts in your tank. 
p1076
aVZiip pods fit the juul cost 10$ for 4 pack as opposed to $15 for juul. They hold 1 ml compared to .7 in the juul. Nic salts 50ml like the juul not sure if it is exact ingredient as the juul.  May find them cheaper online and just throwing you another idea/ option. Good luck
p1077
aVIt is the benzoic acid in Juul liquid. It is still the best and quickest way to satisfy nic cravings for me despite moving onto other pod mods because of cost. Juul pods are 50mg/ml but the pods are 0.7ml so technically it's a 59mg liquid. Most salt nic liquid will list their ingredients so you could find another salt nic that has an acid mixed in. \u000a\u000aAlso,  if you're shopping for refillable mods similar to the Juul,  the Kwit stick,  Vladdin RE, and the Smok Infinix are popular choice s.  I have the Kwit stick and the Juul. 
p1078
aVJuul ruined everything\u000a\u000aI haven\u2019t been on this sub that long so I am not sure if this is an unpopular opinion.\u000a\u000aMy personal journey was 2 packs a day to a crap ego to cloud chasing and building to current nic salt and a pod. Part of my quit smoking led me to managing a b&amp;m and personal experience juul kinda screwed us. \u000a\u000aObviously not true everywhere but in my area the vast majority of underage sales were juul and they were not made at shops but at gas stations. \u000a\u000aThe \u201cvape craze\u201d led to and is still leading to some dumb legislation. Don\u2019t get me wrong the vape industry was under attack before but pax gave people the think of the kids excuse. In my experience the industry has been self regulating and done a damn good job of it. \u000a\u000aSo the thing that sparked this was a truth.org ad  and it might have been the dumbest thing I have ever seen. Guess I just needed to vent.
p1079
aVBut the ball stated rolling in 2009 with the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act...Well before Juul was a thing. If you want to blame something blame Obama for starting it.
p1080
aVI would say it's not Juul's fault but rather children ruining everything that is good, as usual. 
p1081
aVCrazy, was hard to pass up. I have nearly 100 boxes of pods due to Juul's scheme in the UK.
p1082
aVIt's what gave the FDA power over us among other things. Other laws have since been enacted and so forth but that was the start of it all. All Juul did was get a shit ton of media attention whether positive or negative. All of the important laws and regulations were already in place and the gears were already turning at it's inception.
p1083
aVI'm so broke I'd kill for free juul stuff. 
p1084
aVIf you're in the UK use this link: http://refer.juul.co.uk/lgKKi
p1085
aVJuul took a page from big tobacco's play book and heavily marketed towards underage individuals through social media and because legislators don't understand the computers, much less the internet and social media, Juul has been allowed to continue this behavior.
p1086
aVDoes every vape manufacturer pay a bunch of Twitter "youth influencers" to go around and take pictures of themselves with a Juul?
p1087
aVI'm not talking about reviewers, I'm talking about youth influencers, people like Kylie Jenner and I don't know if she specifically has marketed Juul, but she was the first name I thought of and if other companies are doing that then shame on them. As I said, I'm not talking about handing free product out to reviewers, but to people on Reddit with large amounts of young followers who then start using the Juul product without disclosing that they are being paid by Juul to do that.
p1088
aVPeople of legal age buy the juuls and pods for the kids everywhere IDs it\u2019s not the ID check that\u2019s the problem. 
p1089
aVOne might argue that kids that use juuls would have used cigarettes anyway. As a Myle user (same as juul except better imo) I'm extremely angry with them for giving the government and excuse to push more bs regulations on us. It's the only thing that's ever gotten me to drop cigs...
p1090
aVIf it wasn't Juul it was gonna be someone else. 
p1091
aVMarketing guy here, this is really common in most products. Juul is just one of the few vaping companies that have their marketing shit together and aren't wobbling around trying to figure it out. \u000a\u000aIt's not that you've never seen it before, you just like this product and noticed it this time ha
p1092
aVI have one question: *Why is the Juul so popular?*\u000a\u000aLike, I just... I just don't get it.\u000a\u000aThe battery is trash at 200mAh, the boxy edges feel terrible in your hand, it generally feels like cheap factory-made plastic, the flavours are just okay, it's pricey as all hell, it only takes closed pods... I could go on.\u000a\u000aI just don't understand. There are so many better options for less money on the market.\u000a\u000aAnd don't get me wrong, I don't want to completely knock Juul vapes or the vapers that use them (I understand the  "it feels like a ciggy" argument) but like goddamn, somebody tell me what I'm missing. Vaping for 6+ years, multiple mods of all types including pods, and never have I considered buying one.
p1093
aVI work at a gas station that sells juul pods and it's crazy the amount of kids that try to come in to buy them on a daily basis
p1094
aVUnrelated question since you seem to have a myle and a Juul. How is the Myle better? Which has more vapor production and flavor? and Does the Myle have more dry hits or less dry hits?
p1095
aVI have tried every type of electronic cigarette device imaginable. From ego to dual 18650 boxes with RDAs, many pod systems with saltnics (Breeze, mi-pod, smok novo) but I had always kept a pack of cigarettes on me, and I just couldn't get off them, until that is, I tried the Juul with the 5% mango pods (aka pods of the gods) and that has gotten me completely off of cigarettes. Juul is the closest substitute to a cigarette on the market, so much so it actually feels better than smoking. There's something they put in those Juul pods that just make the experience even better than smoking a cig. Plus it's the sleekest looking pod-system, and it feels the "cleanest". Being a purely American brand also means you don't have to worry about shady Chinese business practices.

p1097
aVI liked the suorin &amp; Suorin drop way more than the juul, but I feel ya. I was chasing the perfect vape for a few years, and went to every end of the spectrum even spending hours on elaborate coils.  When I finally found it I developed a severe allergy to vaping though haha. :-(    Oh well.  I enjoyed it for a bit.\u000a
p1098
aVWhat pisses me off about juul is there is no possibility of incremental reduction of nicotine, they essentially want you to stay addicted, I have no respect for them as they are as bad a big tobacco in my eyes. 
p1099
aVI'm not disagreeing with you so there's nothing to prove. You just don't seem to grasp that literally every single other vape company does this. Juul didn't start something...They followed the already established industry mold.
p1100
aVSure it's manufactured in China, but it's still a 100% American company with American directors that overlook the production process. I made the mistake of buying alternative pods for the Juul made by some Chinese company and they had the worst chemical plasticky smell ever. Can't trust Chinese management. 
p1101
aVYeah but some of us don't intend to quit and just want to replace smokes though. There's nothing locking that person into sticking with Juul if they wanted to step down their nicotine. Tobacco companies didn't force us to smoke either. The problem with statements like this is they place the entire blame on something and remove all personal accountability and responsibility. "Tobacco companies made me a smoke or Juul made me a nicotine addict!" LOL
p1102
aVAnd how are they stopping anyone from switching to a different device if their intent is to step down? I'm sure most people with that intent don't even consider the Juul knowing they only offer two levels of nic. You're not locked to a Juul for life if you're serious about completely quitting smoking and then vaping.
p1103
aVI get it but you don't seem to grasp that **EVERYONE** does it. From the lowliest juice companies, to the Chinese brands, to giants like Juul. That's how the industry operates.
p1104
aVNo, you don't grasp the difference between a reviewer and a social media influencer. You just don't. I have tried to explain it to you, but you don't. You think somebody reviewing a product has as much influence has somebody with 2 million twitter followers, mostly young teenagers taking pictures of themselves with their Juul. You don't understand the difference and I am tired of explaining it to you.
p1105
aVCan't answer my questions so we resort to name calling. Sorry for pointing out the holes in your statement but really it's not a slave and master situation being a Juul user. We do have the freedom of choice.
p1106
aVBecause the user experience, honestly. 5+ years of every kind of mod imaginable and I slowly switched to Juul about a year ago and haven't looked back.\u000a\u000aHere's the simplest way to explain it:\u000a\u000a- Almost every one of us on this subreddit has spent way too much money on mods + juice. Retail therapy not withstanding, the idea of always looking out for the next golden goose is exhausting.\u000a\u000a- The user experience of mods has always been shitty. Sub-ohm tanks were probably the best of the best as far as ease of use/quality of vape before I switched. Even then, we're talking carrying around batteries, battery chargers, juice bottles or banana bottles, switching coils with my hands in public places, random dry hits, leaks in my pocket, hands, replacing the glass on the tanks, buying new tanks because tanks shorted for unknown reasons, etc.\u000a\u000a- Juul user experience is much better than it sounds on paper - sure, the pods are expensive and the battery life doesn't last, but it also takes approximately 10 minutes of charge to give you a usable 3 hours of vape time. If you carry two Juuls, you can vape your way through pretty much any occasion. The pods are extremely available, even at 7-11, and even after the flavor ban - Mint (my favorite flavor) is still widely available. Pods = no juice on my hands, no juice in mouth and just an extremely simple experience.\u000a\u000a- Salt nicotine is just my jam. I had switched to salt nic juice and mods before going juul and I just preferred the throat hit. It also helped to be able to vape indoors (at my house) and not fog up the room. Every person in my life who interacts with me on a regular basis was happier that I didn't blow enormous clouds.\u000a\u000aAll that said, there's nothing like fresh cotton on a dripper with an awesome juice (especially rich dessert flavors like unicorn milk.) But the cost and experience of that was just not worth it for me.\u000a\u000a(P.S. - Kind of an important one for me. I'm having a son this week and coincidently naming him Roman. Have you liked your name so far in your life?)\u000a\u000a
p1107
aVI vape and I certainly hope my options aren't affected by any legislation. That said, I completely agree with you about how the vaping industry (Juul in particular) screwed themselves by marketing to kids. There are tons of vape shops that look more like candy stores or ice cream shops than "adult smoking alternative centers". Promoting rad flavors with 18-year old scantily-clad models on social media (coconut creme razzbery pie, etc) is a good example of how the vape industry is just ASKING to be regulated. \u000a\u000aI've got downvoted a few times for saying this stuff and I don't understand why. I think lots of people here are vape shop owners or workers and they just don't want to see it. The most common retort I get is **"adults like candy, too"** \u005c- and I agree. But that's not an argument you're going to win when you're playing against gov't regulations. \u000a\u000aUntil the vape industry stops packaging and promoting juices as if they're selling cans of Mountain Dew XTREME, they heat will only intensify. We wouldn't be in this mess if every sample came in a plain, clear bottle without all the extra cartoon graphics, etc. If people aren't willing to accept or admit their mistakes, everyone making money in this industry is in for a shock. 
p1108
aVI can distinguish what I do from what they do. It's just that Juul is not the only one using their services. Vice recently did a piece that I think you should watch that breaks down how things work fairly accurately and features a underage vaper that managed to BS his way to getting sponsored by at least a juice company.
p1109
aVWhether it's JUULs fault lies in whether they targetted kids.\u000a\u000aIf they did NOT and kids took to JUUL because it was small, cool, cheap or affordable.  If that's the case then the problem lies with shopkeepers selling them to kids.\u000a\u000aIf they DID target kids the JUUL is at fault.  
p1110
aVFair enough points, but that's counter-intuitive to consumer culture. Consumers want the best bang for their buck along with ease of access, so why hasn't STLTH blown up in the way JUUL did? Why not Bo? They are both comparable in almost every aspect, and in most cases they're better.\u000a\u000aI'm starting to think it's the "proprietary blend" juice they use. I know it's just salt nic, but do they add extra benzoic acid? It's gotta be something like that.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a(And trust me, the name is the best thing you could do for your kid! All my life I've heard people tell me my name's awesome, and since there isn't so many of us, it makes you stand out. Just be ready for the nicknames \u005c[Caesar, Roman numerals, Roman Polanski, Tony Romo, etc.\u005c] and it's really weird learning about the Romans in history class.)
p1111
aVFirst off, I never said Juul was the *only* company doing this, so I don't know why you are deciding to protect Juul, an objectively inferior product, by stating that it's fine because everybody does it, yet somehow everybody does it but Juul managed to take a much larger market share with said objectively inferior product. I will also point out that if a vaper is lying about his age to get sponsorship, that's on that person more than the company.\u000a\u000aAgain, paying a reviewer to hype your product is shitty, but it's no where close to the level that Juul is playing at. Juul specifically went after teens and tweens. I even linked an article where that was stated multiple times. Your only come back has been basically, trust me, everybody does it, with absolutely nothing to back that claim up. I assume you are not marketing your reviews at children, are you. Rip Trippers is not marketing his reviews at children. I don't care if somebody is a shill reviewer. That plagues every industry that has reviewers. There is a problem when an adult only industry specifically targets underage people in any way. 
p1112
aVAnd yet it's clearly not the case everywhere because every 14 year old has a Juul.
p1113
aVOddly enough my experience with my trusty snowwolf and my valyrian tank has been way more consistent and reliable than any juul or the sourin I had. My first juul broke in a week and my second was just too inconsistent. Sometimes you will get a good hit but most of the time it leaves something to be desired. Not to mention the price of the pods if you aren't a bargain Hunter.  \u000a\u000aThe battery wears out fast on a juul and having a couple of sets of batteries that I can easily swap in and out when needed is a lot more convenient for me. Top filling my tank makes putting in juice super fast. \u000a\u000aThe biggest pro of the small juul like devices is the portability and concielment. For my uses my mod is more convenient. \u000a\u000a
p1114
aVSince it's obvious that Juuls are popular, did your B&amp;M start carrying them and then get a window sticker that says "Juul sold here"?\u000a\u000aHaving an elitist attitude towards Juul and similar products isn't doing your B&amp;M any good because like you said, most of Juul sales are in gas stations because that's where they sell them.  \u000a\u000aAlso, I'd imagine buying Juuls is much more convenient because you're in and out of the gas station where a B&amp;M tries to sell me something else every once and a while.  All I want is my juice or coils quickly and I want to get out of there.  \u000a\u000a
p1115
aVIt's UK only but: http://refer.juul.co.uk/lgKKi
p1116
aVAn opinion piece proves nothing. You actually believe that article is substantial proof of them marketing to children? They talked to some researchers that gave their opinion...That doesn't make their opinion correct without actual proof. All I see is Juul doing the same thing everybody else does. 
p1117
aVSo you said that there is no proof because, it's like, just an opinion man, professionals doing research and then come to an opinion. OK, and then after you dismiss what I have to say as an opinion, then you say that Juul actually is doing it, but it's ok because everybody does, which I never said is not the case.\u000a\u000aSo you are refuting something that you then defend by saying everybody does it. Wow.\u000a\u000abut, ok, not good enough for you? Fair enough. How about this article where Christina Zayas literally admits to marketing Juul for her blog posts and Juul liking her specifically because, as she puts it, "They liked my edgy style and that I appealed to the younger market," \u000a\u000ahttps://www.kitv.com/story/39653670/juul-how-social-media-hyped-nicotine-for-a-new-generation\u000a\u000aIs that just an opinion? or are you going to fall back on the everybody else is doing it line that you have shown zero proof of. Have a wonderful day. =)
p1118
aV&gt; So you are refuting something that you then defend by saying everybody does it. Wow. Nice debate skills.\u000a\u000aWhat?!?!? My point the whole time was that everybody does it...It's not just Juul and they weren't the first. I never refuted them using influencers and reviewers to promote their products. I think you need to reread everything I wrote. I even told you at one point I'm not disputing that they do it.
p1119
aVFair enough.\u000a\u000aJuul and possibly some other companies took a page from big tobacco's play book and heavily marketed towards underage individuals through social media and because legislators don't understand computers, much less the internet and social media, Juul has been allowed to continue this behavior.\u000a\u000aThere. Are you happy?
p1120
aVYeah, Juul isn't a world-wide thing. As far as I know, it's pretty much limited to the US and the UK.
p1121
aVWhat\u2019s interesting is that now they\u2019re pulling flavors from gas stations, NOW the B&amp;M have the upper hand. We get to sell the fruit flavors and creme brle. And 90% of Juul users tend to get Mango or Mint. At least at the shop I work at. \u000a\u000aBut what\u2019s crazy is Juul packs\u2019 wholesale prices are barely below MSRP so the shops aren\u2019t actually making much money off of them. MINT, on the other hand, are much lower, wholesale price. Which really isn\u2019t our big thing, our shop isn\u2019t scrambling for money from everyone and we\u2019re not offended if someone comes in and doesn\u2019t buy anything, but just to look. it\u2019s just the principal. \u000a\u000aBut it still makes me wonder how much money they lost pulling the flavored pods from gas stations, charging shops much higher prices than before. Obviously they have to make their money somewhere, but just that realization makes me feel like they\u2019re scummy. They were selling larger quantities and shipping those to gas stations while selling to shops, yet as soon they pull the pods, they make us pay even more...\u000a\u000aWe\u2019ll continue having Juul products only because we have plenty of users who come to us for pods and whatnot. Just an interesting \u201cinsider\u201d perspective from someone who works at a shop too. 
p1122
aVJuul ruined inferior competitors.  
p1123
aVhttps://www.businessinsider.com/juul-e-cig-marketing-youtube-twitter-instagram-social-media-advertising-study-2018-10\u000a\u000a@Doit4Juul was a Juul promoted instagram account.\u000a\u000aThe account asked followers to share selfies, photos, and videos documenting themselves using Juul devices. And share they did. Images included youngsters jamming as many Juuls as they could in their mouths at once and then blowing out massive plumes of vapor; *children openly using Juul devices in classrooms*; and kids sharing tips on how to sneak the devices into school by encasing them in the bodies of Sharpie pens." italicizing was my doing\u000a\u000aJuul had an instagram account with children vaping Juuls in class rooms.
p1124
aVJuul is responsible for uploaded user created content? If I uploaded a dick pic it would be Juuls fault I uploaded it? Did they ask for underage children to take pics of themselves in their classes with their devices? Did they use these pics in any other form of marketing? Did they remove them once they were up? You sound like you're on the wrong side of the fence just because you dislike Juul. 
p1125
aVOk, that not good enough for you?\u000a\u000ahttps://www.businessinsider.com/juul-e-cig-startup-marketing-appealed-to-teens-2018-7\u000a\u000aAshley Gould, Juul's chief administrative officer told Business Insider that Juul did have a previous advertising campaign, before she joined the company, that included imagery that "was not consistent with our brand."\u000a\u000a"We have to take ownership for what was done in the past," she said. "Our objective is to be open and transparent. Could we have done things different in the past? Yes."\u000a\u000aNow I want you to be 100% honest with me. I want you to also know that Juul is currently being investigated by the FDA for marketing to children. I am going to repeat that. The FDA is currently investigating Juul for marketing to children. One more time. The FDA is currently investigating Juul for marketing to children. Now, being 100% swear on your parents and children, born and unborn, and your lover's lives, \u000a\u000awhen Ashley Gould says that "We have to take ownership for what was done in the past," what do you think Ashley Gould is referring to. Can you be 100% honest? Or will you continue to play ignorant.
p1126
aVAnd did the FDA find anything or are any actions being taken against Juul? I'm sure if the Feds found anything we would have heard about it by now and actions would have been taken. It's innocent until proven guilty and not the other way around. She means they could have used older models and shit as they do now...Not that they were flyering middle schools with coupons for free Juuls.
p1127
aVI answered your question. Let me quote myself...\u000a\u000a&gt; She means they could have used older models and shit as they do now...Not that they were flyering middle schools with coupons for free Juuls.\u000a\u000a
p1128
aVWhat do you think Ashley Gould referred to in this article https://www.businessinsider.com/juul-e-cig-startup-marketing-appealed-to-teens-2018-7\u000a\u000awhen she said "We have to take ownership for what was done in the past."
p1129
aVBecause I don't think Juul did anything outside of normal vape marketing and didn't specifically target teens. I don't think Juul ruined everything like the title of this thread. I think they're just another scapegoat for people's misplaced anger and frustration.
p1130
aVJuul made them do it.
p1131
aVWow, can't believe I read that entire thing. Damn, Darkcide is a massive shill. Hey Darkcide how much money does Juul pay you? Can I get in on that action? I can suck Juul's dick better than you can.
p1132
aVI don't even own a Juul. I'm just not willing to throw them under a bus and agree with the anti-vapers. We gain nothing by sacrificing our own.
p1133
aVNo, you are lying to my face is what you are doing. I have provided enough evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, from experts, that Juul engaged in practices focusing on targeting under aged inviduals. I showed you a young person, whose blog was followed by UNDER AGED INDIVIDUALS, who was sponsored by Juul. Multiple professionals all agree, and yet you do not. This is beyond reasonable, at this point it seems to me why you are behaving like this, and it's just disappointing. You could at least be honest with me. I wouldn't make a big deal about it. This is willful ignorance on your part. You know it. I know it.
p1134
aVYour post history is a Juul commercial.
p1135
aVNo it doesn't,but not the first time being accused of being a fuckin' shill.  You will see a timeline of starting out with a wotofo freakshow, moving on to wasting more and more time buying every fuckin' tank, mod,wire, coils, etc and finally just buying a juul and donating all that other shit away. \u000a\u000aNot needing any other device due to time savings, convenience ,no more sticky juice on your hands and a more consistent experience was a plus for me. I found out quickly how disgusting a large majority of the vape industry is during that run. \u000a\u000a Just like all the youtube vape clowns getting paid big bucks by the Chinese to shill the newest greatest thing in the world with the slightest variation of the same fucking product. It's a racket. Just like when the voopoo people started having their friends contacting me to try and do shill amazon reviews for goddamn anti-snoring masks. 
p1136
aVConsumers don't care about bang for buck, that's only people in the know. Consumers care about style and ease of use. Juul's charging method is honestly what wins. STLTH and Bo are both using micro-usb? That's shit, tbh.
p1137
aVI'd have to agree, here, the only easily accessed product is Juul pods, as they are in every gas station. Nearest B&amp;M is 20 miles from here, and it is against state law to order online. \u000a\u000aEveryone I know around me, but myself and my father has a Juul. So with their popularity and easy access, it may be a coincidence, but I don't think it is.
p1138
aV[http://refer.juul.co.uk/lgKKi](http://refer.juul.co.uk/lgKKi)
p1139
aVYep, I remember when the problem was the survey asking kids if they used "e-cigarettes". They said no because they called it a vape not an ecig. Same problem emerged later that they say they don't vape because they call it juuling.
p1140
aVYou're slightly misinformed. The reason your wholesale price is higher on mango, cucumber, and creme is because juul will no longer sell them to distributors. They will only sell them in limited quantities directly to shops who implement their software that is supposed to force ID scanning and quantity limits. Which right now means they are currently selling to nobody. Supply is limited to whatever people have left.
p1141
aVStupid kids. Two years ago it's "vaping is gay" and only neckbeards with gauged ears and trucker hats vaped. But change the name to "juuling" and it's cool. Like "alcohol is for weird creeps, but Smirnoff ice is so cool" dafuq???
p1142
aVJuul didnt ruin anything.  \u000aIf anything they are the natural evolution of the industry.  \u000aThey have the biggest share of the vape industry and so they are the focus right now but kids vape anything they can get and hell they will smoke cigarettes too.  \u000aIf I had to blame anyone it would be the copyright infringement juices and the cloud vapors that gave vaping a bad name.  \u000aPersonally I am happy they are focusing on juul. As it is the biggest name in the game perhaps we can get some studies into a system that is widely used and fixed.  \u000aIf juul proves to be safe to use as I am thinking then I couldnt give two shits if kids get it really. Nicotine alone is addictive sure but so is caffeine. At least its not killing them or the people around them.  \u000aStill to many people that think vaping and smoking are the same thing. They are not.  \u000aEven the quit smoking organizations are spreading lies about vaping. I mean get off it. Smoking is at an all time low and dropping yearly. The battle is basically won. Like cops in a crime free world coming down hard on a jay walker.
p1143
aVI like the one "did you know each Juul pod contains as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes?"\u000a\u000aLooks @ a Juul pack at store, says clearly: each pod contains 5% nicotine by volume, approximately equal to one pack of cigarettes. Smh.
p1144
aVActually, I see three elements to the latest out-cry over teen vaping.  Juul's sales success, fueled by a media frenzy that hyped how 'cool' it was, irresponsible marketing of juice including trademark rip-off of child related images - juice-box, smurf, etc, and zero context  statistics on use in news articles from media outlets desperate to survive in a changed news environment
p1145
aVJuul's issue with the UK was due to not spending enough time on the liquids. I think having to fall under the EUTPD guidelines forced them into a bit of a rush to get into other markets. Their liquids in my opinion just are, "blah"....without the high percentage they have in the US it's a level playing field over here. \u000a\u000aI really have a hard time believing they can really win a market like they did in the US without that. \u000a
p1146
aVI partly agree. I mean these Juul devices are certainly not for me.. and they certainly had their hand forced dropping the concentration to 2%.. I get a better hit from my subohm device with 3mg juice and it's pretty obvious the device was designed with 50mg in mind..\u000a\u000aHowever I think they will do very well, what other options do people have when going into the supermarket to buy a vape? And who else is marketing as aggressively as this? All of us in this sub are actually into vaping, for some even a hobby.. the general public isn't generally like this. I think it will be the leader of these type of devices..
p1147
aVWell they likely will themselves start cracking down on imports when they find them (such as online) so it's going to be hard to get imports especially on a public website. While it's easy now that's probably due to Juul not cracking the whip. \u000a\u000aWorking for blu (it's ok if you hate it) I can tell you they aren't the only game in town. One thing tobacco companies learned a long time ago is that you can promote a vape all you want. If it doesn't work for most smokers all you did was promote them into a different product. 
p1148
aVThat is not really true....EUTPD effects imports as well. Any person importing higher nicotine strength pods and sells them is breaking the law (I would question if even importation outside of research purposes is actually allowed). Also if Juul let someone they know import into the UK they would be breaking the law. That's why they will likely start cracking the whip on this. Either way it's illegal to do....just yea the buyer probably won't get caught? \u000a\u000aAbout 3 years ago, I would agree with you. If what you say was true Juul would not be making over 1bn in profit. Vape shops are not stealing market share from Juul in the US it's the other way around. If you see nicotine satisfaction improve as it seems to be improving I almost wonder how big the vape shop channel can really get. 
p1149
aVSome big tobacco company lookjng to buy major stake in Juul? Rumor has it....
p1150
aVYea, but the person who sells them is still breaking the law. That's why Juul would crack down on it, they have a legal responsibility to. I'm not saying black market goes away...just that it'll begin to be less especially now with Altria injecting 12bn. 
p1151
aVSo, you just get these items shipped for free? You don't pay anyone anything? It's just imported to you as a favor?  ANYONE who sells and imports those e-cigs into the EU has to follow the law. If they are indeed selling these pods to you, then importing them that's against the law. I'm not saying they will get caught (regulation is only as strong as the enforcement) however it is technically against the law for them to sell and import into the EU to you. \u000a\u000a&gt;The definition described e-cigarette producers as any entity that manufactures, imports, or re-brands any tobacco related products for resale. \u000a\u000a&gt;All member states were required to ensure that all producers and importers of tobacco and their related products to provide correct information to the pertinent authorities within the provided timelines. The obligation to provide such information was placed primarily on manufacturers and importers of all tobacco and their related products to the relevant authorities.\u000a\u000ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_Products_Directive\u000a\u000a*UK specific*\u000a\u000a&gt;A producer is anyone who manufactures or imports these products or who re-brands any product as their own. Producers must submit information about their products to MHRA through a European Common Entry Gate (EU-CEG) notification portal.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/e-cigarettes-regulations-for-consumer-products\u000a\u000a\u000aThey not only have to follow the law, but they also have to report into the member states what they are importing and ensure it is compliant with the law. Your pods are not compliant and ANYONE who imports these pods to you, rather private citizen or public entity then has to follow the law. \u000a\u000aWhen I've seen product shipped from the US to the UK or other EU member states it goes through a bit of lengthy process. Again I'm not trying to be some moral police here. I honestly could care less how much you import...but the law is the law and at some point Juul will work with the governments to help enforce it, because it eats into their bottom line. \u000a\u000a\u000a

aVGoing on a trip, don't want to take my usual gear, considering a Juul/Vuse/that type set up. Any thoughts or suggestions?\u000a\u000aPretty soon I'm going on a trip so the possibility of losing my kit and not being able to get it back is higher, and I don't want to have to pack eliquid because of them being confiscated by airport security or explode in my checked bag. \u000a\u000aIts domestic so there's no problems buying pods. I know Juul is the big name in disposable pods but before I go ahead and buy that, does anyone have a better suggestion, or reasons against the Juul? 
p1153
aVNothing is likely to happen as long as you don\u2019t try to hide anything, follow the rules about how much liquid you can bring on board (for carry on, individual bottles that are no more than 100ml, as many that can still fit in a 1qt bag), seal opened bottles with electrical tape, and batteries in plastic cases in your carry on bag. \u000a\u000aGetting something like a Juul is a decent idea for a quick, stealthy bump, so long as you only use it on the ground, not in the air. On my last vacation, I got one for just that reason. 
p1154
aVYou can find Juuls and Juul pods everywhere...7/11 carries them. \u000a\u000aNot as common is the Kwit stick...its a better pod mod with prefilled pods but when they get empty, it has a plug that is made to be refilled. I have both...I really like the virginia tobacco and mint flavors of the Juul but the Kwit stick is a better device and the watermelon is pretty good.

aVI just bought a justfog minifit. Need help from expert here as I'm a new user. I had tried a vape unit a long time ago but felt maintenance was a hassle to went back to normal cigs. Last week a friend was using a nanostix (pod type similar to juul) and I tested a few pumps and got a good hit from just a few puffs. Went to a vape shop and he recommended the minifit as the shop didn't sell the nanostix. After using the minifit for the past few days, I can't get the same hit as the nanostix (which I just tested once so I might be wrong)\u000a\u000aSo my questions;\u000a1. Is the lower hit just because of the current flavor choice on my minifit?\u000a2. Can I get the same hit with the correct nic salt liquid on my minifit?\u000a3. Is the minifit compatible with both nic salt and conventional liqiud?\u000a\u000aThe minifit is the better economical choice vs the nanostix, (I also prefer the smaller stealthier size) but if I can't get the same hit, I might as well get a nanostix.
p1156
aV1. Lower hit on a pod system is almost always related to the nic level. Try some 50mg nic salts or you can use 12mg freebase but make sure it's 50/50 PG/VG. Anything more or less and you'll have leaky pods or pods not wicking. \u000a\u000a2. You should be able to assuming nothing is wrong with the device. \u000a\u000a3. Conventional liquid (freebase) should work if its 50/50 like I said. However,  the salts will satisfy cravings faster, more like a cig. The Juul Virginia is very good for that, but expensive. The Kwit stick is also a good one. \u000a\u000aIf you need recommendations of liquids that are closer to a cig flavor,  feel free to ask. 
p1157
aVJuul Help\u000a\u000aI got some cumber pods for my juul but when I put a new pod into the battery it still tastes like cucumber. I've tried cleaning my juul out but nothing seems to work. Any ideas on how to fix this?
p1158
aVYou can push it out with a jey or a flathead. But honestly, just contact juul for a replacement. Theyre fairly good with replacing defective juuls. Dont push the battery out if you do so, though. That breaks the warranty. 
p1159
aVHonestly, I only used the juul for about a month before I switched over to a mod. Im not sure why its doing that for you, but like i said, if the fix is cleaning the battery, youll end up voiding the warranty. Might as well have them send you a new one that\u2019s guaranteed to work rather than you possibly not even able to fix yours and end up with a deadweight juul. 
p1160
aVI liked the Breeze 1 a lot better than the Breeze 2. Breeze 2 looks and feels like a toy, and the hit isn\u2019t as smooth in my personal experience. If you\u2019re trying to get off cigs, I\u2019d go w/ the juul. If you want to try something new, I\u2019d go with the Smoant S8, Renova Zero, Suorin Drop/Air, Smok infinix or Novo.
p1161
aVI was in your shoes just about a month ago. I also came across the same thing. I eventually ended up with the Innokin EQ, the Aspire Spryte, and the Kwit Stick. I use them all now. I had the Juul before these.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aI really like the habit of just holding something between my fingers like a cig, and puffing just like a cig without pushing a button--the Kwit stick is real nice for that.  Their pods come prefilled with juice but have an opening for refilling. They say you can refill them 3 times but I think it can go more. The tobacco that it comes with is real bad, I recommend finding another one to fill it with.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aThe Innokin EQ is very nice and the pods last a long time. The vape is on the warmer side but the draw is very loose. It is not like a cig filter but more like a tobacco pipe filter. The flavor is great and the pods are cheap.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aLastly, the Aspire Spryte has a smaller mouthpiece on the pod than the others--I like that. It comes with two different resistance coils and the air flow/draw is adjustable. You can really dial down how you like it. It also has a big button that is good for gloved hands, if you live in a cold climate.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aYou can't go wrong with any of these choices, I haven't found any cons to them that are worth noting. \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aPraying for the best in your journey, feel free to ask if you need any other help or suggestions.

aVPod system or mtl rda?\u000a\u000aStarted using the juul and I love it. Already gave up on finding a empty compatable pod for it so I'm at a crossroads. Do I get a pod system for salt nic? Or a mtl rda to throw on the pulse 80w and sacrifice the small draw to fire convience of the juul or get a different open pod system? 
p1164
aVSounds about what I was thinking! Really want to keep it true to the juul hit if I'm going to give up the small draw to fire convience but honestly that could change in time just know I'm really about these +35mg salts they just do it for me and I definitely feel bad having the pulse just sitting now :(
p1165
aVGet the Zenith MTL. I have many pod systems. Juul, Mipod, Suorin Air, Minifit. The tank lasts much longer on coils, it is cheaper for coils and has better flavor and throat hit. Not hating at all on pod systems (I still like them for the size factor). And some pod systems work very good (Mipod)
p1166
aVI hated all the faffing around with coils so have gone pod. MiPod was ok but Smoant S8 has ticked every box - almost as good as the Juul and much cheaper to run.
p1167
aVPod system. Breeze 2. Smok novo. Or go real easy with a juul. 
p1168
aVI might get hate from this but youtube is a great way of learning. Riptrippers has guided me through a lot but nothing like hand on experience.\u000a\u000aPersonally I would start with a tank and box mod. \u000aOr maybe a pod or a juul. 
p1169
aVAvoid smok, no working temperature control, no quality control, insulting customer service. In short.. anything but. Well, not ijoy either for the same reasons plus you can break the over hyped craptain just by squeezing it. \u000a\u000a1st vape.. keep it simple, cool fire make some excellent easy to use beginners mods, but it doesn't get simpler (tho it's more expensive in the long run) than pod systems like juul (just an example as my Mrs has one).\u000a\u000aJust my thoughts \U0001f44d
p1170
aVI have tried so many systems, from the SMOK mods, to the Capt'n, to the Juul to the Pix.  Nothing beats my Aspire Breeze mod system.  It's been the most reliable, coils that last a few weeks are only $14, extra tanks are $10 and I can use SALTS or juice as needed.
p1171
aVIs this juice good to refill (JUUL) pods? Plz help :v\u000a\u000aI have purchased 2 bottled of salt bae juice to fill up my juul pods, Blue Rasberry lemonade and red mango. my question here is rating (1-10), flavor (1-10) harshness (1-10) and overall satisfaction! Please keep me updated! 
p1172
aVTried to post to r/juul, but to no avail. I purchased a Juul starter kit at a local QuikTrip (convenience store). I ended up not liking it at all. I\u2019m coming from an Aspire Breeze 1. Is there any way to return this device to the store for a full refund so I can spend the money on my Breeze?\u000a\u000aTitle is the question. I made a decision based off different reviews and word of mouth. I bought one about 3 days ago and haven\u2019t been very happy with it at all. I understand the hype for it and everything but switching from an Aspire Breeze was a mistake for me. 
p1173
aVAre you certain? Last info I have is that Israel just banned Juuls because of their 50mg/ml.\u000a\u000aAnyways, TSA has no beef in that. If, at all, it's Israel's customs.\u000a\u000a
p1174
aVYeah it started with juuls and stemmed to anything above 20, they still sell juul pods but only at 1.7%. Thank you for the additional information though! 
p1175
aVYou'll be fine, it's conptlely legal to sell juul pods here and almost every vape store in the country has 50mg salt nic juice 
p1176
aVThis is very helpful thank you! So I'm assuming the ban isn't really enforced heavily? I emailed juul customer service in Israel and in the response it was implied that the language of the law makes import of anything 20mg+ illegal for juul only. 
p1177
aVThe Future of Coils What's the Outlook?\u000a\u000aSome Pretext: \u000aI'm a grandpa, I've been around marketing and hype and see through most bullshit.\u000aI recently (90 days) quit smokes after many years &lt;-----lying to you, it's decades.\u000aI recently had my doctor tell me straight up to quit smoking and start Vaping. I did some research about vaping and after a few days I knew that Juul and many FAD e-cigs in general were a bad buy and that only true vaping devices offered what it would take to get me off smoking.\u000a\u000aWithin 3 days of heavy searching, watching various videos about vaping,reading latest studies, and I even read some Reddit,  and not sure I would be satisfied with a cheap first purchase, I went with Aspire K3 starter Kit. Totally worked for me, first day. Very Satisfied.\u000a\u000aSo here we are, I'm ready to advance and yet find so many issues with devices, namely Coils. With Cigarettes, a filter is a filter \u000a\u000aI was thinking Aspire Speeder, many here and elsewhere have nothing but good things to say BUT....Those Coils are said to be hard to find and this is what led to my post here:\u000a\u000aWhat is the outlook of Coils?, there are so many manufacturers producing different Coils, I'm not sure what will be available and if there is ever going to be a standard?

aVNew setup for DH\u000a\u000aHi all!\u000a\u000aI\u2019m looking to get a cheap setup for my husband. I currently have a Smok Rolo Badge, and he is not a fan. I\u2019d like to get something sturdy/bulky as he\u2019s a tree climber by trade and has lost 2 JUULs. \u000a\u000aI have an Innokin t20s, which I personally am not a fan of (so many leaks) but he liked it. My brother and I are fans of Smok-Tech, so I\u2019d definitely be willing to purchase something from them again. \u000a\u000aPlease help! Thanks in advance! :)
p1179
aVThat's so awesome! I love hearing stuff like that. Even the Juul, which I'm *heavily* critical of, has a very firm place in the market. The Breeze seems to have really hit home with a lot of former smokers; my husband (who's currently dual-using, to my dismay) is using his Breeze more often than his other 4 rigs. Thanks for sharing your story, it put a smile on my face. 
p1180
aVSo, with nicotine salts. even if it says 30-60mg nicotine, it\u2019s not going to be as harsh as you think it would. For example, if you vaped 12mg freebase vs 55mg nic salts, typically the freebase will be more harsh. Nicotine salts are just smoother vapes. Similarly, 3mg nicotine = smoother than 3mg freebase. Keep in mind, though, that nic salts can buzz the fuck out of you if you\u2019re not used to them. Moving on, nic salts have more of a \u201csharp,\u201d cigarette-like draw, while high freebase is obviously more \u201cscratchy.\u201d \u000a\u000anicotine salts are most popular done through:\u000a\u000aclosed systems - which are non-refillable vapes that you must pre-filled pods for such as the Juul, Phix, and Kilo 1k. In essence, much of these devices mimic a cigarette. Thus, they\u2019re the most convenient option, but also arguably the most expensive. (Bout 20-25 bucks for 4 pack of pods usually). \u000a\u000aRefillable systems: These are pretty much what it says. That is, a vape in which you can buy EMPTY pods for, and you refill them with whatever nicotine salt juice you like (optimum hit at 30-50mg depending on your preference). Typically, you get about 5-10 refills before the pod goes bad, then you get more. I want to point out that there\u2019s also refillable nicotine salt devices that use coils, as opposed to pods. Same exact principle, though. So if you want a pod mod some good ones are: renova zero, smoant s8, Smok infinix and Novo, Suorin Drop/Air. For coil refillable: Breeze 1, 2, and nautilus are pretty popular. You can also subohm with innokin zenith thank.\u000a\u000aJust do research on a few nicotine salt devices, and see which ones you think you\u2019ll like. I personally use the Smoant s8 for nic salt because it\u2019s reliable af.

aVUS: Juul bans vaping in its offices\u000a\u000a
p1182
aVNot only is it CA state law, it's also because the city of SF has been putting quite some pressure on JUUL and the property owners that they rent from regarding compliance matters like how much nicotine is on-site, chemical hazard warnings, etc. etc. They were barking up the wrong tree since there's no manufacturing or inventory, etc. at the location but they did have a point about the CA smokefree workplace laws.
p1183
aV&gt; but there's something to be said for vaping with civility.\u000a\u000aagreed there,  but Juuls aren't the cloud busters a TFV12 is you know? :)
p1184
aVI used a juul at my desk for years and the dude next to me never even knew lol
p1185
aVBecause this media site is spinning it. They want you to think even the mighty Juul doubts the safety of vaping over cigs, or something like that.\u000a\u000aThe moment I read the headline I thought "California has laws against indoor vaping. What?"

aVNJOY ACE - Quick Review - Best Disposable Pod System out there\u000a\u000aI took advantage of the Black Friday deals (Vuse Vibe, Alto, and NJoy Ace) and have used a wide variety of pod systems out there (most popular ones: myVonErl/MyBlu, Juul, Phix, etc)\u000a\u000aI LOVE the NJOY Ace\u000a\u000aPros\u000a\u000a- Feels VERY premium and very nice in the hand (Makes the Vuse Alto, Vibe, and MyBlu feel like cheap plastic that will snap in your hand after using the Ace which has a nice heft to it)\u000a\u000a- Pods are decent sized (1.9 mL I believe)\u000a\u000a- Battery life is great, easily lasts a full day of solid vaping\u000a\u000a- Juice flavors i tried were awesome (favorite right now is the Watermelon Twist and BlueBerry - still have Tobacco, Menthol to try)\u000a\u000a- Pods are affordable since NJOY is always running a sale there has been a 20% and two 30% off coupons since Black Friday. Sign up for the subscription to get an additional $1 off per box and you can get 10 boxes (20 pods total) for roughly $70 or $3.50-3.75 a pod.\u000a\u000a- Pods do NOT LEAK AT ALL. NO SPITBACK, no bubbling of juice at the tip like the myBlu / Vuse Vibe\u000a\u000a- Strong nicotine buzz (50% or 50mg) but seriously barely ANY throat hit, i have to set the device down on a far table so I dont chain vape since it literally feels like you are vaping a 6mg nicotine juice. When I vape the NJoy Ace and Vuse Alto back to back the Alto has a CONSIDERABLY stronger throat hit despite having basically the same strength of nicotine\u000a\u000a- Pods seal into the device via magnets and the seal is tight and doesnt jiggle much\u000a\u000a- Micro-USB charging cable (no dealing with bullshit magnetic chargers that fail - looking at you Vuse Alto and Juul) \u000a\u000a- Charging is very quick via USB\u000a\u000a- Better than average clouds / vapor production\u000a\u000a- Full feeling throat hit in terms of vapor without the harshness\u000a\u000aCons:\u000a\u000a- Dont know if the pods are refillable so this may be a con for some\u000a\u000a- Drip tip may be weird for some users but i dont mind it\u000a\u000a- Soft touch plastic on the device itself may attract some fingerprints\u000a\u000a- havent seen these pods in stores so you will have to order the pods and they do take about 3-5 days to arrive but shipping is free\u000a\u000aHonestly, Ive tried many pod systems and vaped extensively using tanks for over 2 years. This is by far my favorite vaping device I have ever used. Feels awesome, great vapor production, great nicotine buzz, relatively cheap pods that are always on sale, tasty juice - i would recommend this to beginners easily and even experienced vapors looking for a quick, concealable, clean, hassle free vape\u000a\u000aI know this review may come off sounding like a shill but after struggling to find a replacement for my MyBlu and after HATING the Vuse Vibe and Alto (liked the Alto's throat hit more, Vibe's flavors were very weak and nasty tasting compared to the NJoy - which even topped myBlu for me in terms of flavor) I am relieved to have finally found a convenient vaping solution that doesnt require dealing with dud / burnt coils, priming coils, cleaning out tanks, dealing with leaking etc etc.\u000a\u000aIf you think about it an average coil costs $2-4 let's say $3. Decent juice we will say is roughly $15 for 30 ml or 50 cents for 1 mL. Let's say you get 3 tanks out of one refillable pod from a popular pod mod system (what most people say they can get without the flavor tasting like crap or being muted). That's 6 mL of juice or $3, plus the cost of the coil $3 or $6 for 3 pods.\u000a\u000a$2 a pod when you refill it yourself and buy replacement coils/pods and juice or you can just buy these pods for $3.50-3.80 a pod.\u000a\u000aFor $1.50 you get the convenience of popping a pod in and going about your day, for me it's worth it.\u000a\u000aIf anyone wants some comparisons between the Ace and the myBlu or Vibe or Alto lemme know in the comments would be happy to help!\u000a\u000a\u000a
p1189
aVI\u2019ll jump in here because I don\u2019t have enough to say for a full review. I just tried the Njoy Ace because I got a coupon for a device and a pack of pods for 99 cents. The only thing I can say is WOW! I used to like the Njoy Kings back in the day and I even got a few Njoy Dailies through the years. I always liked their flavors but never stuck with them because of quality, this device feels so nice though. I\u2019m using the Blueberry pods right now and I\u2019m strongly considering leaving Juul for this device. I just hope they come up with more flavors because I\u2019m only really interested in the blueberry, although I may try the Classic Tobacco if it\u2019s the same recipe that was in the Kings.
p1190
aVive had a few pods that tasted burnt but no more than myBlu or Juul in the past\u000a\u000afor the most part i enjoy the device and am happy with flavor, vapor output, nicotine buzz, and most importantly battery life and feel in hand\u000a\u000aid say hands down this is the best portable vape out there
p1191
aVive had some issues with the device myself i contacted the company and any burnt or burnt tasting pods im saving and sending back for a replacement\u000a\u000athe pods do get a burnt taste more than myblu but to me taste better and leak alot less\u000a\u000ai dont know if im gonna continue to buy some bc the burning is pissing me the fuck off like it is for you and i bought tons, i would say if i can keep gettin the pods for 40-50% off ill keep getting Njoy Ace pods bc the hit when it does work is just so smooth it absolutely shits on Juul/MyBlu when it comes to nice smooth draw for the amount of nic you are getting and MyBlu drove me crazy with it's leaking and spitback especially i would constantly have to dab the top on kleenex\u000a\u000ai dont think there is truly a perfect pod
p1192
aVNjoy always has sale codes the biggest recently was 30% but I\u2019ve purchased Ace pods at 50% \u000a\u000aI\u2019m excited to try the Loop but the low juice capacity per pod puts it at a worse value than the JUUL honestly \u000a\u000aThe Loop pods are $8 for a box of two and NJoy rates them at 150 puffs per pod at 45% nic \u000a\u000aMeanwhile the ACE pods are $10 for a box of two and Njoy rates them at 325 puffs per pod at 50% nic\u000a\u000aDon\u2019t understand why they are giving double the capacity for literally $1 more per pod than the Loop seems pretty dumb 
p1193
aVI have been spending 40 dollars a week on juul pods, what are some cheaper alternatives?\u000a\u000aAs you can see by the title I am done wasting so much money on juul pods and want to switch up my vape. What are some good vapes you guys could recommend, right now I am looking at the sourin air. And do they make juice that does not have diacetyl?
p1194
aVJuul pods are refillable are they not? My co-worker has one and I can refill his with my juice.
p1195
aVOVNS JC01 pods are juul compatible and also refillable. You can get those and some juice and not have to worry about getting a new device.
p1196
aVWhen i used juul i bought ziip pods. 1 millileter  compared .7 in the juul and 10 bucks as opposed to 15.  Still can get expensive rhough
p1197
aVI use a Joyetech AIO but was looking to move on to the Nautilus AIO, which has a pod system. So maybe that is an option? I've heard pretty good things about it and the small size but large juice capacity was a big pro for me. \u000a\u000aI never dealt with JUULs so I can't compare the few units I've used to the JUUL but $40 seems like a ton of money to spend on pods. Are you going through them faster than normal, maybe? Heavy ex-smoker? I get 60ml of juice to last me almost two weeks, or at least 10 days, and that's at $13-15 a bottle.
p1198
aVYes I do and they work quite well. I prefer them over most of the other refillable pod systems.\u000aOVNS makes pretty good devices themselves. Their pods are good, but the other options for "off brand juul pods" don't seem to work very well. 
p1199
aVYes I do, and they work quite well. I prefer them over most of the other refillable pod systems.\u000aOVNS makes pretty good devices themselves as well. I started using their pods on their own device because it seems to have better battery life than the juul
p1200
aVempty ceramic pods, compatible with Juul are available. these are refillable, Lets you fill with any E-liquid or concentrates. \u000a\u000apodplug.co 
p1201
aVA little late, but i was lookin at an OVNS device to replace my Juul, since they have mor Battery life.\u000aBut i\u2018ve seen there\u2018s multiple devices, the Saber, the Saber-S, the JC01 and the SC 420.\u000aDo you by any chance know if all of these work with the same pods and if there\u2018s any difference beside the looks?
p1202
aVThe JC01 is the one that is Juul compatible. As far as I know, the others are not. \u000a\u000aFor refillable pods: If you can find J-Pods, we've now switched to those instead of the pods from OVNS, as they work a bit better. Although we are still selling the JC01 devices cause those still seem to be the best Juul-compatible mod for now. 
p1203
aVI have a theory about the truth.com commercials.\u000a\u000aSo if any of you watch much tv, you\u2019ve probably seen a truth.com commercial. You know, those \u201chip\u201d commercial directed at young adults with a simple message: quit smoking.\u000a\u000aAt least, that\u2019s what they were for the past few years.\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve noticed that for the past maybe 6 months, not a single one of their commercials have had to do with smoking at all any more.\u000a\u000aEvery single commercial they run now is about how vaping isn\u2019t safer than smoking. \u201cOne Juul pod contains the amount of nicotine as 20 cigarettes.\u201d \u201cVaping is saf *AIR HORN*, it\u2019s saf *AIR HORN*\u201d\u000a\u000aMy theory is that they have either been bought out by big tobacco through the form of discrete corporations or some sort of lobby. The fact that their message completely changed is pretty fishy to me.\u000a\u000aBy the way, nobody kills an entire fucking Juul pod in one sitting. I don\u2019t have a Juul, but I\u2019d imagine a pod lasts more than 20 uses. The message in itself makes no sense.\u000a\u000aAny thoughts on this? Either way it\u2019s shitty the vaping community is getting shit on all of a sudden when it helps people quit smoking, by a company founded with the mission to help people quit smoking.
p1204
aVI have a juul, want to change to something else\u000a\u000ahey, I used to vape a while back. had a mod can't even remember what it was called some like black and red thing and the tank leaked it was a mess. I went back to smoking til I saw a buddy of mine carrying a juul. I liked the idea went out and bought one. but let's be honest the juul isn't all that good. pods are expensive, battery life is awful and their proprietary charger is a pain. so while I am not looking to get back to the mod life I want an upgrade preferably a pod system so I can use those nic salts. \u000aI am looking at either the vladdin re or the smok infinix \u000aI heard good things about both. \u000awhat I am concerned with is\u000ahow often am I gonna have to buy new pods\u000aand whether or not they leak.\u000athe flavor is important but not deal breaking as sometimes with  the juul when I have vaped on it long enough I just can't taste it anymore. I just need my nicotine.\u000athanks in advance

aVLol, Employer Rights. I suppose Juul can allow workers to vape in the office? Nope, not anymore. California just sent Juul a letter...\u000a\u000a&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/microwaved-fish-was-once-the-workplace-aggravationnow-its-vaping-11544821176\u000a\u000aWe have what rights we demand.
p1206
aVI've been using a juul for the past 6 months. Looking to get back into a regular box mod. I already have the mod, just will need new batteries and an external charger. My question is...what are some of the best tanks on the market right now in terms of flavor and cloud production?
p1207
aVMarkTen ceasing production, need help.\u000a\u000aHi I am an ex-smoker who switched to MarkTens a few years back successfully dropping real cigarettes entirely. \u000a\u000aI've tried big mods but I find the maintenance to be too much of a hassle, and the available flavours are often too powerful/too sweet to be a regular thing. I really liked MarkTen because the flavour is extremely mild, smooth, and hits like the real thing.\u000a\u000aThey are no longer making these, and I have enough to last me too March of next year, but I'm panicking. I've seen a lot about JUUL, but similar products like Blu and Vuse have just been aful, so I'm worried it'll be the same. \u000a\u000aDoes anyone have any experience with MarkTen classics and can tell me a good alternative? I need something easy, mild, not sweet, not fruity.\u000a\u000aI appreciate the help!
p1208
aVYou\u2019re not really going to find anything close to the Mark10. The convince of those things is unbelievable. I used those for about a year and a half, then switched to a box/atty combo and never really looked back. Your best bet is to switch to something like the JUUL. You\u2019ll get a lot of info here for sure, but for someone who\u2019s new to stuff that\u2019s not sold in a gas station you may be overwhelmed with all the info. I\u2019d go to your local vape shop and see what they have to offer in support of a pod based system. 
p1209
aVpart of the problem is I don't live in the US anymore, so whatever I switch to I'm sending it to my family and they're mailing it to me.\u000a\u000aIs JUUL's tobacco flavour similar in taste to the Mark10? I'm hoping it's not overpowering \u000a\u000aI tried the box/atomizer thing for a while, but, as I said, the juices available were all far to sugary for me to use regularly. 
p1210
aVJuul + Virginia Tobacco. 
p1211
aVThe Juul Virginia Tobacco flavour is quite dry and almost ashy, as ejuices go. It's quite authentic and may be what you're after. I haven't tried the MarkTen, though, so take that with a grain of salt.\u000a\u000aYour problem with too-sweet juices is shared by a lot of people and I really wish there were at least a few companies that would back off on the sweetener. I haven't really found any companies that do aside from smaller-time manufacturers.
p1212
aVIf OP's going to go with something they have to refill, they'd be better off with a different pod system entirely. While the Juul isn't really all that hard to fill it's still messy and a little finicky.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately there aren't a ton of other options in the cigalike form factor. Anything that's worth anything is either much bigger or much heavier (relatively speaking; they're not huge). The Vladdin RE is apparently decent, and while I haven't really heard *anything* about the Suorin iShare it seems to have gotten good reviews. The iShare has a "pack" with two removable "cigarettes" and magnetic contacts to both charge the "cigs" and hold them in place. The flavour probably won't be as good as another pod system but you may like it more than your MarkTens.
p1213
aVOr he could grab the third party refillable pods for the juul.
p1214
aVThere's an idea! OP, if you go the Juul route it's generally advisable to get two because the battery capacity is quite small. \u000a\u000aOVNS makes ceramic refillables, but I dislike recommending anything ceramic just cos the jury's still out on the health risks. Plus, pods get knocked around a lot which could introduce ceramic dust into the atty.
p1215
aVDoes anyone else use a JUUL alongside their mod?\u000a\u000aI have a smok tank and innokin mvp4 but I love to use my JUUL when out at bars and stuff since it hits like a real cig and I don\u2019t have to lug around a big mod everywhere. The vapor isn\u2019t as big either which is nice as I hate accidentally getting my big clouds near people lol.\u000a\u000aAnyone else use a JUUL or pod system alongside there mod?
p1216
aVI have a smok tank and a JUUL and I use them for the exact same reason, JUUL is nice when I don\u2019t want to carry my mod around 
p1217
aVRevenger X + Gear RTA with a Juul on the side filled with naked salt. 
p1218
aVI have a Pico 25 = Zenith for MTL.\u000aAs for pods, I carry a Juul, Minifit, Mipod, Suorin Air and use them equally at home. \u000aThe Sourin Air for me is the best MTL pod, kinda weird since it's the cheapest but the hits are really good. \u000aThe Mipod has great DTL.\u000aI Still think the best throat hit and flavor comes from the Zenith tank, but it's hard to carry around a box mod.\u000aAnd I use 50mg nic salts (Solace) mango and dragonfruit all the time. Best way to mimic the Juul flavors.
p1219
aVI think the air pulls the best for mtl (besides Juul) but the pod quality with horrifying 
p1220
aVWe don't have Juul but I keep Aspire Spryte at work just in case.
p1221
aVI keep a juul in my pocket at work and if I'm going to be someplace for awhile where I can't vape freely. \u000a\u000a
p1222
aVSwitched to juul,dropped the mod\u000a\u000a....Then realized jull is expensive and bought other pod systems  ;)
p1223
aVDone with big bulky mods, Juul plus some dabbling into other pod devices. Nothing else hits like it. 
p1224
aVJust so you know, Juul uses a special additive called benzoic acid (called sodium benzoate in its water-soluble form IIRC) that allows the nicotine to hit you much faster and stronger. Juul has the patent on this formulation and all similar ones so you're not going to see anything like it on the market until a new additive or extraction process is found.
p1225
aVI've hit a JUUL and I've hit 50mg salt nics in an AIO pod system. They're the same. JUUL does not have a patent on benzoic acid.
p1226
aVNo, they don't have a patent on benzoic acid. They have a patent on the formulation that includes the benzoic acid, VG/PG, nic and flavouring. Say what you will about The Verge but [they're the first hit that comes up](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/21/18105969/juul-vaping-nicotine-salts-electronic-cigarettes-myblu-vuse-markten) on my shitty Google knockoff.
p1227
aVHmmm, thank you for the correction! I was under the impression it was a much more complicated process to turn freebase into salts, and then Juul added benzoic acid on top to increase its effectiveness.\u000a\u000aA rather interesting aside: through a little digging I found out that there's freebase nicotine in cigar, pipe and other unrefined tobacco while the nicotine in cigarettes is nicotine salt. Philip Morris discovered in the 50s or 60s that they could reduce the harshness of their cigarettes by treating the tobacco leaves with ammonia to perform an at least somewhat similar chemical reaction to our freebase -&gt; salts ejuice! This meant, however, they could pump up the amount of nicotine in their cigarettes so that while they'd be smoother you'd get way more hooked.\u000a\u000aThere are a few parallels there; but the biggest difference is that, for us, we don't have to vape a whole pod in one sitting.  We can really customize how much nic we get. You don't really want to smoke a cigarette in quarters. Yeugh.
p1228
aVI have not bought a pod system,  but if I did I wouldn't get a JUUL. I would look into a cheaper, possibly better,  alternative. \u000a\u000aI really only vape MTL with freebase 6mg nicotine. I probably should just drop to 3mg. I am honestly a little scared to start using a pod with salt nicotine.  I don't want to increase my nicotine intake,  or get more hooked on it.  I may be misinformed,  because I pay very little attention to pod systems,  but I worry that using pods will make me "more addicted". 
p1229
aVI own both mentioned here and while I like both, for your scenario, there are better choices. I\u2019d straight up just get a pod if you\u2019re only using it when you\u2019re out. Kwit Stick is pretty discrete and has a refillable pod. Otherwise Juul - sounds cliche but it\u2019s perfect for out and about / travel. 
p1230
aVBest kit to pick up for a returning vaper?\u000a\u000aI've had a few kits here and there in the past, but I eventually sold them and ended up getting a Juul. Now I'm looking to get back into the game so to speak. What is the best, no hassle kit that I could pick up in a vape shop? 
p1231
aVGood recommendations here for the full size box mod end of the spectrum.\u000a\u000aI'll throw another card on the table - low output pod systems are a new craze (Aspire Breeze is good among others). \u000a\u000aThey enjoy the same size/weight benefit of the Juul but are designed to be refillable with your own juice and quite frankly, you can get pretty good flavor out of these pods now. It's not the same as a full size sub-ohm setup, but it's pretty damn close. Inconspicuous low cloud output is another plus in my book. \u000a\u000aFood for thought.
p1232
aVIt's irresponsible considering that in the eyes of the media the Juul is the vape of choice for underage users who try to vape in secret at school, and this product is perfect for making it much easier to stealth vape a juul. \u000a\u000aMaybe that was there intention, maybe it wasn't - but I'm sure they were more than aware of the stealth vape potential of it.
p1233
aVThis doesn't help use a Juul in any way. It doesn't even function with Juul. If you want to hit your Juul in class you'll do it like anyone else trying to stealth vape and hide it in your sleeve.

p1235
aVWell damn...I missed that they made it compatible with the Juul now. But still it shows there original intent wasn't to make it easier to hide a Juul. It's all still so damn silly to me that vapers will take a "Think about the children!" stance just like the FDA or politicians on dumb and irrelevant shit or products that they don't like. We'll criticize them for doing it but it's okay for us to do it. :-/ I highly doubt one niche product jeopardizes us in any way, shape, or form...Especially seeing as how it has never been mentioned as a factor in any of the FDA or other politicians arguments or decisions.  
p1236
aVThe flavor bans are just misguided. People use fruit and dessert flavors because \u201ctobacco\u201d flavor isn\u2019t very good, and not everyone likes menthol. The flavors are absolutely not intended to appeal to children. (Analogy to Fruit Loop flavored vodka that\u2019s in my cabinet right now.) \u000a\u000aAnd teens aren\u2019t picking up Juuls because they taste like candy, they\u2019re doing it because they think it\u2019s \u201ccool,\u201d and their friends are doing it, just like how a lot of us started smoking. Cigarettes don\u2019t taste good, but we still started. \u000a\u000aI agree that teenagers don\u2019t need to take up vaping. But this isn\u2019t the way to stop them. 
p1237
aVSalt nic to freebase help\u000a\u000aI just ordered a kroma a Zenith mtl kit, I've been a juul user for about two years now, but finally got sick of the cost. My question is what freebase nicotine mg  should I be vaping to satisfy a good throat hit and nic fix? 
p1238
aVIf you want the same nic fix, you could use salts in the Zenith.  It'll produce more vapour than the Juul, so you might want to drop your concentration.  I use half the concentration in my Zenith than I use in pods (12 mg and 24 mg), but YMMV.\u000a\u000aFreebase nicotine gets really harsh at high concentrations.  One of the reasons pods are so popular now is the development of nicotine salts, which are smooth at high concentrations.  You might not enjoy vaping freebase nicotine at the concentration you've been using for nic salts.
p1239
aVI agree with this guy. I run a Pico 25 + Zenith tank for MTL but instead of 30mg I use 50mg (solace, cause it reminds me of juul flavors) and it hits like a smooth truck, in a good way, for me at least :)

aVBeginner, struggling with a Breeze 2\u000a\u000aHey, so About a month ago I quit cigarettes and switched to vaping, I bought a juul and used it for the first week with little to no problems!! To my surprise no withdrawals nothing. Long story short I didn't like the closed pod system And upgraded to a breeze 2...\u000a\u000aBought a system, and a pack of 1.0 coils 3 weeks ago along with a bottle of red apple 50mg salt nic juice. Charged it up put in the .6 coil and used it for a few days and loved it. After some reading though i found that you shouldn't use salt nic juice on sub ohm coils so I switched to the 1.0... and that's when the problems started. I loaded up the second fresh coil from the box and it worked well for a few days, however i did instantly notice a huge drop in airflow(which i did not like) but not only that after 2 days the coil seemingly clogged and would barely hit... i thought ok maybe it's a bad coil and changed it out again. It's been 2 weeks since then and I've already had the same issues or burnt taste on 4 of the 5 coils in the pack.. I'm on my last one now and at my whits end with this thing.. i don't want to go back to cigarettes but this has been a terrible first experience for vapes, frustrating mechanically and the lack of air flow provides too harsh of a throat hit... sorry for the rant if you made it thru this thank you!!!\u000a\u000a****i do make sure the juice holes are lined up properly and the air control is always maxed out on my device****\u000a\u000a\u000aMain questions I'd like answered.. \u000a\u000a1. What am I doing wrong with the coils\u000a2. Are the coils supposed to last for more then 5ml of juice?\u000a3. Did i just purchase a poor quality device?\u000a\u000aWell. First post on Reddit so hopefully it'll kick off well, I've been reading and following the community for years. \u000aCheers

p1242
aVOk, so let's quickly explain what freebase and salts are. First of all freebase is exactly what the name describes. A free base. Nic is a chemical base (opposite of an acid) without anything else attached. It has a region of the molecule that wants to react, but has nothing to react with. \u000a\u000aA salt is when you give that base an acid to react with. You now have an acid+base compound and that's a chemical salt. This is how its naturally found is tobacco but the extraction process strips the acid away, so to make a salt you put it back in. Juul uses benzoic acid, but most manufacturers use an amino acid. It's much more bioavailable and that's why they're so popular. When I say this, I mean from the time of inhale, salts pass the blood brain barrier in 3-5 seconds vs 15-20 from freebase. Again this is what smokers are used to  so that's why it makes a better quitting system. \u000a\u000aNow as I said a free base is more reactive when you give it an environment to react in. This is why that 24mg can burn like fucking hellfire. But a salt has that acid attached to it, that makes it stable and far less painful in the throat. \u000a\u000aWhat salts do is let smokers have the same puff type their used to, with the same nic per puff they're used to, with the same throat feel they're used to. \u000a\u000aAs a final bit, nic salts and freebase are still the same amount of nic. You can absolutely safely sub ohm 3mg of nic salt. I do.

aVI might ramble. Srynotsry. \u000a\u000aMy buddy gave me a juul battery a while back so I gave it a go. Turns out high concentration salts just aren't for me; wound up back on my regular rotation. Difference being I guess is that I do enjoy my sort of standard rotation. \u000a\u000aHad a Berserker mtl tank for a while (still have it, just semi decommissioned). I liked the vape but got super frustrated with wicking it. I feel like this is a me issue though, not necessarily 'Zerker issue. \u000a\u000a\u000aNow I never wound up pulling the trigger but *for me* ~12 mg freebase in a MTL dripper sounds pretty good if I was looking to reduce cloud production. \u000a\u000aI guess 2 things to close: 1) This is all sort of subjective. What works for one person may not be ideal for the next. 2) Be a little careful with your dosage if you up the nic concentration and/or move to salts.\u000a\u000aThere's a dude around here somewhere who wrote up a little series on MTL.

aVWhat is closest in shape/size/flavour to an actual menthol cigarette?\u000a\u000aI'm trying to get my mother to switch from smoking (2 packs a day) to vaping. \u000a\u000aI bought her a nautilus mini a few years ago, but she hated the size and wouldn't use it. I suggested Juul, but she didn't like the shape; she wants something very similar to a cigarette. She tried a Blu menthol and loved the form factor but thought it tasted too sweet \u2013 she hates anything that tastes sweet. \u000a\u000aAre there any options that come in the size/shape of a traditional cigarette, that also taste like a menthol cigarette?
p1256
aVDepends on what you call very low maintenance.\u000a\u000aSome things that I would consider low maintenance:\u000a\u000a- External battery mods (mod is the part that provides power) with a tank that takes prebuilt coils, the batteries in these should be removed and charged, the coils should be changed, the juice has to be refilled when it runs low, and the wattage has to be set (recommendations for what to use are on the coils for the tank you buy). All of this is pretty easy and would only take a few minutes a day, but this is the most intensive of this list.\u000a\u000a- Internal battery mods with a tank that takes prebuilt coils. Basically the same as external battery mods but they need to be plugged into the wall to charge. After a year or so the battery will start to lose charge and you will have to buy another mod.\u000a\u000a- Refillable pod systems. Smaller than internal battery mods, take proprietary pods as opposed to a tank with changeable coils. You will have to replace the pods occasionally. Eventually the battery will wear out or break and you'll need a new unit. No setting wattage\u000a\u000a- Closed pod systems. Like a JUUL. No refilling, no setting wattage, just charging and changing pods. Eventually the battery will wear out or break and you will need a new one. Arguably the easiest to use and basically new versions of cigalikes, most expensive option as you are getting convenience at a price.

Juul came out after and did this to save face, the FDA guidelines caused the punt, juul did it for PR.

aV1 3 4 5 7. I really want a nice pod system, the juul pods are too expensive 
p1273
aV1,3,4,5,7\u000a\u000aMy girlfriend is still stuck on her Juul, Hopefully I can give her this for xmas!
p1274
aVOH I GET IT like ET as in extra terrestrial \u000ai've tried the breeze 2, didnt' like it\u000afinally feel into the juul hype train but i don't want to be another one of those juulers soo... et auto lets go!
p1275
aVDefinitely EQ man, I don't see any other pod systems are better than this yet. Well, if you don't have a budget problem, Juul would be the best.
p1276
aVAfter all this time, still nobody seems to have managed to build a device that is as consistent as a goddamn juul and refilling pods.. 
p1277
aVNice. Thanks for sharing. I'm not sure I see the value in a device dedicated to 50mg nic salts, though; can you explain? The only use case I can see for 50mg is something like the Minifit or a refillable Juul pod, where the device makes very small clouds.\u000a
p1278
aVThey're coming down on Juul as well. The FDA seems to think flavored nicotine is bad yet doesnt do anything about fruity alcohol. 
p1279
aVDone.  I know Zeke Cohen.  Here is my email to him:\u000a\u000aZeke - I was appalled to find out that you are one of those inclined to vote for a flavor ban in vaping liquids.  According to Open Data we have about 24% of Baltimore residents smoking cigarettes and slowly killing themselves.\u000a\u000aI was one of them - pack and a half a day fro 32 years.  Nothing worked, not cold turkey, not the patch not the gum, not hypnosis.... nothing.  Until I picked up a vape pen more than 4 years ago and woke up 2 days later, looked at my cigs, looked at my Peach Lemonade vape- and threw the pack away.  Haven't smoked since, and couldn't have done it without the flavors.\u000a\u000aI have no illusions about vaping.  I curate scientific and news posts for a larget on-line vaping forum.  I have a physics/biology education (long story for another day why I am a lawyer repping abused/neglected children in foster care).  Vaping is not safe.  Inhaling anything other than pollution free air is not safe.  However, the cancer risk vapes vs cigs is on the order of 57,000x less (all cites available upon request), COPD/asthma patients experience few episodes after switching to vapes (my doc was amazed at my chest x-ray after only 4 months off the cigs), nicotine has been estimated to approximate caffeine on it's cardiac impact, and it's much less expensive then smoking.\u000a\u000aI understand that you have been swayed by the hysteria around teen vaping.  Let me make a number of points.  1) most of the data showing massive percentages related to teen vaping are percent increases - wildly inflated by the fact that easily used, effective pod systems like Juul have been around for only about 3 years - hence the "giant" increases in the growth rate.  2) absolute numbers/percentages of teens vaping are based on asking teens if they vaped, at all, in the last month, and then labeling anyone who answers in the affirmative a vaper - consider what answer is to be expected when asking a teen if they participate in the latest hot coolness. 3) Please note that teen SMOKING has reduced to the lowest percentage ever - coincident with the rise of vaping.  While speculation abounds, there are no high quality data to suggest that vaping leads to smoking, only associational studies that suggest that teens who will experiment with vapes will experiment with other things.\u000a\u000aZeke - in my opinion, the best way to encourage a teen to do something is tell them not to, while wildly, provably, exaggerating the risks.  You may be old enough to remember when LSD was headlines in the papers and on the news, leading to a huge expansion in the number of people who tried it.  Or the ridiculous hype around the dangers of marijuana, leading to most young people invalidating any info coming from the government on any recreational drugs. \u000a\u000aI am not opposed to cracking down on cutesy, cartoon character trademark rippoff advertising.  I have no issue with establishing standards for ingredients and manufacture.  I could even live with the proposed FDA ban on convenience stores and gas stations selling flavored vapes.  However, banning flavors will prevent many adults from switching from smoking to vapes - which the Royal College of Physicians tells us is 95-98% less of a health risk. Since flavors are in fact FDA approved for ingestion food flavorings, those of us who already vape will be able to mix our own - but the tens of thousands of Baltimore smokers will just continue to die (in between trying the patch and gum which has been shown to be as effective as cold turkey -as in, not at all).\u000a\u000aI have, personally, gotten more than 25 Baltimore residents to stop smoking with vapes - and not one of them, not one! wanted tobacco flavored juice.\u000a\u000aPlease reconsider this very bad, counter productive proposal.  I can be reached back at this email address or at 443-540-2615 if you wish to discuss this further.\u000a\u000a-- \u000aMark Stave\u000a\u000a

aVLeak proof MTL RTA?\u000a\u000aSo after trying my friends juul and getting a good hit off it I am curious about nic salts.  I refuse to get in to  a pod system, it's so much waste and i'd rather not beat up the planet. So I am looking for a tank that will handle nic salts. Was going to go with the OBS engine MTL, but I can't find it anywhere and it looks like they've went back to the nano. Would the nano be a good choice? Is there any other top airflow MTL RTA's I should be considering?

aVbest pod mod system for beginner?\u000a\u000aI started looking at the juul but moved on to looking at better options with refillable pods\u000a\u000aI was about to buy a  Suorin drop but started reading on reddit about a lot of problems with them\u000a\u000aI see people seem to like the SMOK Novo but not sure what the consensus is\u000a\u000aI knew there were a lot of options and opinions but I am quickly getting in over my head and don't know what to get now\u000a\u000ait will be a x-mass gift for my wife so I want to make sure I get the best option without spending too much in case she decides she does not like vaping\u000a\u000aany help would be greatly appreciated 
p1282
aVA Juul.
p1283
aVYou're not wrong. I bought my girlfriend a smok novo in the exact color she's been wanting so I can stop refilling her Juul pods for her when she runs out of oem liquid. Would've spent the extra $25 and gotten her an Orion had I known about this.
p1284
aVBest portable, refillable pod system vape?\u000a\u000aI've used a juul for a while and finally got sick of it. I want big rips, which my juul wasn't giving, but I want the vapor to be dry like a juul, not wet like some mods I've tried. Also would like it to be relatively compact for discretely carrying in a pocket. 
p1285
aVI've tried a number of pod systems, my top two so far are the Mi Pod and the Nautilus AIO.  I lean more towards the Mi Pod due to the automatic switch, and the simpler construction.  Next on my list to try are the Innokin EQ and the OVNS JCO1 (although the OVNS will be my first Juul compatible system).  I've tried the Baton v.1, Justfog Minifit, Sourin Drop, and Ego AIO Eco (not really a pod system, but made for nic salts).  
p1286
aVThere is some, very thin evidence based on rat studies, that nicotine "affects" developing brains, in some way, possibly negative.\u000a\u000aNicotine *may*, also, have long-term effects on the cardiovascular system.\u000a\u000aHowever, nicotine is by itself is fairly benign, and unless you have cancer, actually comes with a host of benefits.\u000a\u000aNicotine is probably about as addictive as caffeine and has similar cognitive and cardiovascular effects. No one complains or says a word when a teenager brings Starbucks or Dunkin to class, but omg, don't hit that JUUL, it contains **AN ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE**!!!!!!!!!
p1287
aVtbh it was the only things i didnt not checked into at all ..all i knew about pods few days ago was JUUL and some other brand and there is like thousands of brand of some sites lmao. im surprised i thought it was bs by pure ignorance \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;
p1288
aVAs a side note (slightly off-topic): I thought that freebase nicotine (the purest form of nicotine) used in e-liquids is not directly extracted from tobacco. The nicotine found in tobacco is nicotine salts, and only some manufacturers (for example juul) are using nicotine salts directly derived from tobacco leafs.\u000a\u000aThe majority of e-liquid brands (and even tobacco-based products) however are using the freebase version, which usually involves de-protonating of the nicotine, to extract the salts from the nicotine. This makes the nicotine 'unstable' and therefore easier to bind with the lungs, brain, and the central nervous system, therefore making it more addictive.
p1289
aVYou\u2019re right. Most on the market use acids to make salts - although was unaware of juul et al doing anything different.
p1290
aV&gt; some manufacturers (for example juul) are using nicotine salts directly derived from tobacco leafs.\u000a\u000aWhere did you get that? I'm not even sure nicotine benzoate is found in the tobacco plant.
p1291
aVWhen you consider how little of your juice is actually nicotine, its not that much of a cost-add.  3mg/ml is only 0.3% nicotine; the Juul at 50 mg/ml is 5%.  \u000a\u000aIf you vape at 3mg, as I do:  \u000aLet's say pure nic in bulk as about $500/L*, or $.50 per ml, so a 50 ml bottle would have .15 ml of pure nic at a cost of $.075 (seven and a half cents).  If the synthetic nic is $5000/L (10x), the cost of the nic in that bottle is now $.75, less than a $.70 raise.\u000a\u000aIf you are Juul, with a pod size of .7ml and a nic strength of 50mg/ml (5%):  \u000aThe cost of regular nic in that pod is (.035 ml * $.5/ml) or $.0175 per pod.  10X nicotine raises the cost to $.175 per pod, about a $.15 increase.\u000a\u000aI'd say it's not a big deal.\u000a\u000a\u000a*I'm pretty sure this is a high estimate FWIW.
p1292
aVAny ideas why I\u2019m not so fond of mine? Gets ok flavor but the hits are rather inconsistent on either mode. \u000a\u000aBeen searching for something I like enough to put the Juul down. 
p1293
aVWho knows if online sales will be eliminated in the US. We also don't know what will happen with whoever leads the FDA after Gottlieb, especially if the GOP loses in 2020. Even if the FDA allows some flavors, many states and cities likely will not.\u000a\u000aWe might assume that big tobacco will be increasingly involved with closed pod vapes (not just Altria with Juul) and maybe heat not burn, tbd. Easy to track, tax, and regulate. Altria can afford the PMTA studies.\u000a\u000aThere are countries where vaping is seen in a better light, or moving in that direction. \u000a\u000aIf really looking to stay in the US, maybe consider something else that is trending towards increased legalization on a state- not federal level. Vaping can be combined with that. Not all eggs in 1 basket. That industry may also wind up with big tobacco in the US.\u000a
p1294
aVLooking for a good tobacco Nic salt (Read Description)\u000a\u000aFor those of you who use to smoke thats what im looking for. I enjoy N.E.Ts quite a bit and the one I vape now probably about as close to a cigarette as I'll get. With that being said I enjoy the kick you get from nicsalts as its a bit closer to a hit from a cig and the flavor of juuls va tobacco quite a bit so looking for something like it or better :)
p1295
aVMinifit and nicotine level question\u000a\u000aHey I've searched the sub and kinda got mixed answers. I was using the juul and it officially helped me stop analogs. I then transitioned to the justfog minifit and I went to 35 mg salt nic. I want to go down in nicotine. I find myself chain vaping...not sure if it's cravings or habit...or both. Anyway, I called my local store and I said I want to ween off and I suggested 12mg freebase and they said that would be too strong so I should do 6mg or even 3mg. Would that be too much of a drastic change? The guy on the phone said that the 35mg translates to a 3 mg in freebase. I thought it was much higher. I would just love any insight on what I should do. Thank you. 
p1296
aVOut of the countless pod systems i've used the only ones i'd deem reliable are the innoken eq and the juul, suorin products have horrible quality control i'd suggest avoiding them. 
p1297
aVThe one Juul that will rule us all\u000a\u000a
p1298
aVWould you buy a Big Tobacco vape if it was good.\u000a\u000aSo its become very clear that the government won't stop until they regulate vaping out of existence.  But what if they just embraced it.  I know Altria it's trying to get in with Juul but that's not what I mean.\u000a\u000aWhat if some states just said fuck our MSA money, took a loss and invested in their own vape devices.  Or (insert Big tobacco company name) took the time to create a good device.  Is this out of the realm of possibility and would you buy one of these products if it meant your state would leave vaping alone?
p1299
aVYou could leave the question at just the subject line, and I'd say the market is sadly already answering that question. Juul was the final nail in the coffin for a lot of hurting shops.
p1300
aVI already own one, sadly Altria is discontinuing MarkTen since all they seem to care about is Juul now. It doesnt bother me that much. 
p1301
aVNo. Even if it was affordable, even if it was open system, even if the flavors were ten times better. Name any feature, and they fixed their flaws 100%. I still wouldn't. Why would I hand money back after they [arguably] shaved years off my life? Even if it was Camel-branded, and it was the best option, aesthetics and all, I still wouldn't. And I was a loyal Camel smoker.\u000a\u000a&gt;regulate vaping out of existence\u000a\u000aIf BT cigalikes, et al products are all that's left, that would be considered what's left of vaping and would therefore be considered vaping. It wouldn't be de facto, it would be de jure. But this is being nit picky.\u000a\u000a&gt;... if it meant your state would leave vaping alone?\u000a\u000aMine already has. For the time being, at least. 21+ laws aren't a problem. 30% warning labels aren't a problem. Professional labels alongside those 30% labels aren't a problem either. Asking companies, especially your hole-in-the-wall shop down the corner, to always, always, always, always, always, always, always card isn't a problem either (the repetition is important). The same goes for online retailers and vendors, regardless of which AVS they or the FDA choose, or whose responsibility it is. Using ham-handed arguments to deny these truths are the problem. I see them in almost every discussion whenever they come up, often reversing themselves in the same responses.\u000a\u000aI've gotten past the whole 99% garbage, because I haven't seen any proof of it. Some shops have shut down because of *fear* of regulations both before and after they were set in place, yes, but the FDA has been ignominiously slow and also obtuse with what they actually want from vendors. If they truly wanted to shut it down, they would have by now.\u000a\u000a&gt;What if some states just said fuck our MSA money\u000a\u000aThey already have, which is why we're seeing what we see now. If it weren't vapor products, it would have been some other less harmful industry. Swedish Match, for example, as much as it has a terribly low share of sales in the US, can barely get through to the FDA on the difference between snus and cigarettes. And snus is centuries older than these products.\u000a\u000aYou'd be well advised to continue supporting all of the other companies, and letting Juul fall by its own sword. They aren't on your side if they even consider the possibility of accepting a BT alliance.

aVbest mango nic-salt juice for a heavy hitter?\u000a\u000aReddit search is being an ass right now but I'm a dedicated Juul-fiend atm with a vaping background that goes back to 2009 and e-cigarette-forum.com starting with the original NJOYs moving into Radio Shack box mods, then the OG Provari, and SMOK devices like the Mag 250W. \u000a\u000aI'm buying a Suorin Air (unless someone chimes in with a better idea for a stealthy automatic battery device) and want something similar to Juul's Mango but am open to brighter flavors and don't mind a milder throat hit for frequent use since the Juul tears my throat up (I'm a 2.5 pods / day sober living RC junkie in the early white knuckle phase) and has me coughing up phlegm like an analog smoker.\u000a\u000aThanks!
p1303
aVIs it? Sorry I\u2019m new to this and just recently started using ecigs, tried juul and it was really good but the pods were too expensive. Then the Vape store guy suggested me this and he even said tht one pod will last you a month. Man I\u2019m so scared now 
p1304
aVBest draw activated pod system?\u000a\u000aI've been vaping for about 6 months, I own a minifit pod system and vaperesso armour pro with an RTA.\u000a\u000aI'm wanting to buy myself a draw activated pod system similar to the juul - hopefully a longer battery life. Its also a bit plus if you're able to rebuild the coil like you can with the minifit.\u000a\u000aWhat's your favourite and are there any "best" ones? I'm not too worried about price.
p1305
aVI ilke the sleek look of the juul though, any ideas? pull to activate is a must also.
p1306
aVJust get a juul if you want a juul
p1307
aVLol ya these types of subs get that kind of fanboyism for sure. I will not buy it, I'm not interested in the look either way. I want draw activated and in the form factor of the juul.
p1308
aVIf you want something really similar to the juul, I would suggest the batan v2. It has a really tight pull, even moreso than the juul. Hit rlly similar to a cig. Vapor production is about double of Juul, and the flavors for it are stellar. Pretty much the only thing similar to juul that isn't huge. Like, vladdin re and infinix are probably 2 most popular stick shape devices rn, but they're huge and don't look anything like the Juul. 
p1309
aVI have the mipod but it always spits juice back nothing worse then salt nic in the mouth I liked how much vapor it produces vs a juul but I can't stand the popping juice in my mouth any pods that are as good as the juul with not getting juice in your mouth?
p1310
aVI want to quit smoking Cigs.  What set up or product in your opinion most closely resembles a cigarette? I know there is a lot of hype around Juuls?  Any thoughts or suggestions on this would be great appreciated.
p1311
aVA  pod device is going tot he closest thing you can get.  The JUUL is good for what it is and not a bad place to start. The pods can get a little pricey but it's fast and easy to use and you get the pods pretty much anywhere.  There is a list of recommendations in the side bar from Anthony\u005c_Vapes, there's a section in it for pod devices if you're interested in checking out others.
p1312
aVjuul
p1313
aV6mg in a MTL (mouth to lung like cigs) setup is what you want.\u000aDtl (direct to lung like hookah) system like the one you have makes one take too big and too hot puff to begin with.\u000a\u000aA Juul or any pod system is good enough to start.
p1314
aVI use Juul batteries and either refill the pods or buy empties. They take a while to get used to filling, but once you can figure it out it\u2019s not too bad. The pods are good for maybe 2-3 fills with my experience putting Mr. Salt E in them. \u000a\u000aI\u2019m sure others will recommend more \u201crobust\u201d pod systems, but this works pretty well for me, and replacements for any part of the setup are really easy to come by locally even if there\u2019s no vape shop nearby. 
p1315
aVAwesome man yea i just ordered mine today from element vape got the black frame red carbon fiber grabbed the kit so ill be able to see which pods work best for what im vapeing. Going from refilling leaky ass juul pods to the Orion so its def an upgrade.
p1316
aVNeed help quick on poisoning\u000a\u000aCan you get nicotine poisoning from one juul hit?
p1317
aVLmao ok thanks, first time and I\u2019m feeling really panicky (I\u2019m a non smoker) and I hit my friends juul 
p1318
aVNicotine's LD-50 is fairly high compared to fun drugs. So while you might catch a nicotine buzz from hell, you shouldn't be in any actual danger. My advice? Don't keep hitting that Juul unless you dig nicotine addiction. Eventually that buzz will go away.
p1319
aVUS: Politico article on Juul's efforts to influence legislators and attorneys General with campaign money and lobbying\u000a\u000a
p1320
aVMI-POD or SMOK NOVO?\u000a\u000aI heard good things about both devices but I can't seem to pick and choose which to buy.\u000a\u000aI like airy hits and I've only used the juul and suorin air when it comes to vaping. The suorin air hits too harsh for me and I feel like the carts would burn too fast. \u000a\u000aI've tried my friends bigger mods before, I think it's SMOK not too sure but the big ass ones if you know what I mean haha and I love the airy like, smooth hits and I was wondering if either the mipod or the novo would give me anything similar to that.\u000a\u000a(If you like to recommend me other small-vape devices that would be cool too!)\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aThanks guys! :)
p1321
aVI appreciate the suggestion, but I'd like something that looks and feels more like a normal cigarette. It's a bit wide, or I'd just get a Juul. Thanks though! 
p1322
aVI think the Juul is going to be for you. You can get empty pods to fill with your own juice and I believe it is activated by drawing on it like you would a cigarette. I'd recommend you try a nic salts juice in it. It'll hit most like a cigarette
p1323
aVThere are refillable draw-activated pod systems in a similar form factor to the Juul.  That's the closest you're going to get as far as I can tell.  
p1324
aVIs there anything less flat that a Juul? I guess you can hold it like a cigarette so I'll probably go with that, but I'm still looking in case.
p1325
aVJuul doesn't sell empty pods but you can refill empty ones a couple times. You can buy third party pods for it from a few companies. \u000a\u000aI would suggest taking a look at the Rofvape Warlock Peas. Refillable, cheap, draw activated. Did I mention it's cheap? Ten bucks online usually for the kit. Pods are I think also ten for 5 pods. I'd say go with some nicotine salt juice. Anywhere between 25-40 mg oughta do, depending on how heavy you smoke.
p1326
aVtry looking over the selection at element vape for pod systems, most of them are the flat juul style but some are more rounded
p1327
aVEverybody has their own quirks and tastes and that's as it should be. But what's your issue with button-pushing? I'm not judging, just curious: What about it so unappealing to you? Seems like a minor thing to adapt to, considering the benefits of doing so. \u000a    \u000aLimiting yourself to vaporizers of cigarette-like size, shape, and buttonlessness forces you into a category of vaporizors that tend to fall short of the mark in more important characteristics, such as hit quality, reliability, repeatability. Juul is probably the best of the cigalike-likes, but as you know it has a bit too much in common with cigarettes in cost to use. \u000a    \u000aMany of us here have adapted to the point that our setups are nothing like the cigs we used to smoke, but cost pennies per day and reliably provide a better hit experience than any cigarette ever could. To each his own, but just saying, a little compromise can go a long way.
p1328
aVI see in another comment you mentioned that you're not 100 dead set against the other vapes.\u000a\u000aJuul is the clear suggestion imo. Just buy the pods, it will not be $ efficient but it will be simple, you buy the pods at gas stations. The hit will be strong.\u000a\u000aThe main thing is that its "mouth to lung", which I think its a big part of what you want out of a cigarette. Not just for the sensation, but the lack of overall smoke. Compared to "direct to lung", which is probably what you're thinking with the fat tanks. Those are the ones where you take a hit by just breathing through the tube, no resistance like a regular cigarette.\u000a\u000aI'd say go Juul. When I used the more "serious" vapes with free-base nicotine I still smoked regular cigarettes no matter how high i took the concentration. You want a simple nicotine salt system that will hit you fast so that the switch over to vaping will be easy.\u000a\u000aThen later try the Mouth to lung style vapes, because the free-base nicotine that takes longer to hit you is easier to quit from IMO. Cigarettes =&gt; Juul =&gt; MTL with freebase nicotine that you can gradually reduce the nicotine concentrationi on.\u000a\u000aFor reference, I went cigarettes =&gt; "serious" vape but with real cigarettes all the time =&gt; Juul (quit real cigarettes) =&gt; MTL Vape =&gt; quit soon hopefully
p1329
aVThanks for the suggestions and thought out, in-depth reply. The mouth to lung thing is particularly insightful. I'm looking at other options than a Juul right now, but it's definitely on the list, especially with this in mind. Seriously, thanks. Do you know much about the other adjacent pod systems or just the Juul?
p1330
aV&gt;I'm just really surprised that, on the market side, nobody has made one cig-styled that's custom fillable. I'd figure that's some obvious money to be made.\u000a\u000aThe easy money is in the juice. Closed systems = steady customers. \u000a\u000aI think the tech already exists to make a good open cigarette sized vaporizer. It would be expensive, though, and battery life would suck so you'd need more than one to get you through the day, as well as a custom power bank for portable recharging. The vaporizers would last as long as their internal batteries, which wouldn't be long considering their small size and the frequency with which you would have to recharge them. \u000a\u000aYou'd still have to buy coil heads, and they wouldn't last long either because of their size and because they just don't. So although good small vaporizers can be made, battery and heating/wicking tech is lacking.\u000a\u000aOne of the usually unrecognized advantages of closed systems like Juul is that coil and wicking problems aren't usually a problem since, as long as they're not defectively designed or manufactured, they don't have time to gunk up or short out, etc. A Juul coil/wick only has to last long enough to process 0.7ml of juice. \u000a\u000aOnce you start refilling pods, you'll start to learn why people like larger vapes with larger, longer lasting coils and wicks, or rebuildable coils and wicks.
p1331
aVNo, there are other pod systems with nicotine salt so if youre down to do research this sub has a lot of reviews to make that a bit easier for you. \u000a\u000aJuul is like the iphone of pod systems and for me that was enough because i wanted to keep it simple.\u000a\u000aGood luck man
p1332
aVMy jet is a refillable pod system with similar form factor to juul
p1333
aVNo, its a pod system vape, like a juul. I don't think it has a coil.
p1334
aVJuul. Honestly.
p1335
aVJuul. Hands down. You don\u2019t need the round aspect as much as you think. 20+ year Marlboro smoker and I quit-switched immediately, no transition period. Another surprise: I didn\u2019t like tobacco flavor juice either. I only use mango. 
p1336
aVNo Joke. Juul. I use one myself. (I've spent hundreds of dollars on different types vape equipment.)
p1337
aVMy story as well.\u000a Juul worked when nothing else did.

aVThe Minifit.  \u000aIt's refillable, small, battery charges pretty quickly, and it's not like trying to suck through a pinhole, great price.  25-50mg goes best.  Depending on your use, coil like seems decent.  Primarily, it's refillable!  But seriously, the draw reminds me of a great median between a cigarette or a cigarillo, but with a "semi-adjustable" airflow, you can melt the closed middle hole (silicon gasket is precut) or use a Euro-style cigarette hold to close either airhole to tighten the draw.  \u000a\u000a\u000aIf you desperately want that pinprick tight draw and short coil life, high expense pod shit, at double the length on your wand, don't go with Juul, go with Myle, their pods are secretly refillable.  Shhhh.  \u000aYes, the battery wand is twice as long, and that draw is tight as a mouse's asshole!  Not incredibly smoke like from my perspective of smoking.  Slightly cheaper price point would be the STLTH or (the semi-open/semi-refillable) Fuchai V3.  \u000a\u000a\u000aAll pod style systems, open or closed (refillable or not), are of similar quality.  That is to say, it's not amazing, but the good news is if you go with the right setups, each one is about the cost of a tank for someone using a larger setup, but you save oodles on juice.

p1340
aVJuul\u2019s hit feels like a cig
p1341
aVThere are a couple disposables that have the form factor. I think VapeWild sells them, and I've seen Naked 100 ones also.\u000a\u000aBut OP would be better off with a Juul.  \u000a\u000aOr- something from Innokin (EQ refillable pod, T18 pen vape, Zenith mtl tank d22 mini kit).
p1342
aVBefore you take anyone's advice, id recommend you check if there are any local vape shops around you, and step in and see what they have.  Just tell them you're thinking of switching to vaping and want to see what kind of stuff they have for sale before you make the switch.\u000a\u000aMost likely there will be juuls at a physical vape shop, but you can never be sure.  It would really suck to buy something and not have pods/parts/juice for it available if you run out and forget to order it online.\u000a\u000aIt is almost always cheaper to buy online, but the delay might bite you in the butt if you aren't careful.
p1343
aVNone of the ones that look and feel like a cig are good or seems.  JUUL are a great alternative.  Not much fuss, draw is excellent and flavor is good as well.  There are getting to be a lot of alternative pods out there now that are cheaper than Juul brand pods.  Refillable pods are also available (I recently reviewed sylo pods and they work well)
p1344
aVHonestly juul. Its the best for getting off cigarettes in the first place. Once off of cigarettes the juul can be replaced with something to step down nicotine levels.
p1345
aVSeriously, for someone just trying to get their toes wet the Juul is a great option since it's so easy. Vaping can be a little intimidating at first since there's so much nuance. Once someone knows they're into it, then it's definitely worth investing in a quality setup with the Juul as a backup. 
p1346
aVOvns pods on Juul battery?\u000a\u000aIn the description of the Ovns pod system it states Juul pods are compatible. \u000a\u000aHas anyone tried using Ovsn pods on their Juul to see if it works?
p1347
aVthe JC01 pods do in fact work. People who are sick of the juul's flavours have been using those pods with their own salt nic

aVPlease ask another Mod's opinion. You've made a mistake here. This is very much about e-cigs. Altria is obviously a huge player in the cigarette and e-cig industry. It is reportedly in talks to buy a stake in Juul. Juul as you may know, has its roots in the cannabis industry.\u000a\u000aThis news has 1000 times more relevance to vaping and e-cigs than some new mod or atty that would be posted about ad nauseum. Come on. Even Gregory Conley is talking about this news. 
p1351
aVSo we took a vote again and voted not to put it up. While we do understand it could have potential impact in the future and if that company buys a stake in JUUL you are more then welcome to post it but a tobacco company and a cannabis company making a deal just isn't relevant to ECR at this time
p1352
aVJuul and cannabis. Interesting business model. Enjoy
p1353
aVDang if only the people who make Juul thought of that.....\U0001f609
p1354
aVthey're fighting with juuling and call it vaping too. technically it is, but i would delimit these two terms not to mislead people. \u000a\u000a1. juuling, as vaping in general, should not be accessible for minors. \u000a2. vaping is a way to break the smoking habit.\u000a\u000apunktum.
p1355
aVThe math is selective statistics.   We've known for years a certain percentage of teens will start smoking.  It's inevitable.\u000a\u000aIt's quite likely true.   Compared to non vapers it is likely true.  But correlation doesn't mean causation.   \u000a\u000aIf less kids start smoking over all because of vaping isn't that a good thing ultimately?   \u000a\u000aIt's about harm reduction.   I'm not saying we hand kids juuls who want them.   However some kids are going to start smoking.   It'll never be zero unless we outright ban tobacco and even then banning just creates a black market.  
p1356
aVCongrats. 4 months in from a 30+ year cig habit myself. Stocking with nic salts and mi pod and juul this far. Ordered a orion and cant wait to try it
p1357
aVPod Mod suggestions? Any out there with usb-c?\u000a\u000aI'm currently rocking the smok novo. It's great, but the battery is a little bit small and I seem to be going through pods pretty quickly. I want something with autodraw, a bit bigger of a battery, but the same or better throat hit and flavor. I don't want anything too big though, as I've grown accustomed to holding it in my mouth while doing stuff. I'm not a fan of the juul style, as they never have enough battery.  \u000a\u000a\u000aThe charger being usb-c might be unrealistic, though it definitely can't be proprietary. That shit bothers me to no end.
p1358
aVI personally bought an aspire breeze 2. Its a pretty small device but much larger than a cigarette, but i like the fact i can purchase pods. Its nice to have 1 pod with a 1.0 ohm coil with a salt nic juice for when i need a nic fix and another with regular juice for chain vaping. Coils last a decent amount depending on the juice but its much cheaper than buying cartomizers. Being able to buy a bottle of juice and refill a tank is much more economical than purchasing cartomizers. I tried a juul but $15-20 for what amounts to ~ 3ml of juice is rediculous. \u000aI bought mine for $30 (using a coupon code) and it included a 30ml bottle of nic salt juice for free. \u000aIf you decide to go this way let me know and i can send you the link.\u000aGood luck with your choice, there's tons of options now and i hope you find what works for you to keep from smoking!
p1359
aVNoob here,Quit 25+ years cigs to vape. Mi-pod broke , bot a juul. , ordered an Orion\u000a\u000aAbout 4 months ago the guy at the vape store sold me on a mi-pod. Worked well but died when the air flow sensor went bad. Bought a juul while i waited  for warranty replacement mi pod. Juul was ok for me little tight on the draw   And only 50 mg pods at stores( to strong for me) ,and the pods get expensive ,even the 10 dollar generics. I like the mi-pod also when i can get a good pod.  But it seems i get more duds or most pods, 2 fills maybe 3. And then they are junk.  Got some juice with no sweetener added ,50/50 blend. Naked 100 lava flow.   It is good when i can get a pod thats useable. \u000aTalked to smoking vapor recently and the gave me store credit for some faulty pods.  Ordered 5 packs from them. Out of the 10 pods 3-4 i maybe got any mileage from. Could contact them again and probably get replaced but for what ? more frustration. LoL. Just bot a pack at vape store yesterday. Looks like they may have added a piece of plastic sticking out  where the juice enters the cotton? Not sure but this latest pack i am getting air bubbles galore on the cotton.  I just cant win.   Broke down ordered a Orion today. Sounds promising from all i have read here and elsewhere.  Sounds like the pods will last  a while. \u000a\u000aGot it at breazy dot com. 49.99$.  Pods 7.99$  good deal if it works out. \u000a\u000aStumbled on electronic tobacconist. I love salts nic salts sale 12.95$. Says buy 3 get one free.  But i put 3 in cart and one was free so buy 2 get 1 free. Score\u000aI hadthe grappleberry before and it was amazing. So i got one of them and a blue rasp. And spearmint gum. Cant wait to try them in the Orion\u000a\u000aLong story short,\u000aToo late........\u000a\u000a\u000a
p1360
aVWhen you say air bubbles galore are you just talking about bubbles coming off of the wick? Because if so it\u2019s just absorbing juice better and should help with the longevity of the pod/coil\u000a\u000aPersonally I have used a juul in the past. Wasn\u2019t a fan. Tried a smok infinix (was 8 bucks so I figured why not) wasn\u2019t a fan of that either. Now I\u2019ve got a suorin air for when I\u2019m out and about, and an rda squonk combo for when I\u2019m home. I\u2019ve gone through loads of mods/tanks/atomizers before I found the setup that worked for me. \u000a\u000aDon\u2019t give up, your dream set up is somewhere out there and once you find what you like you\u2019ll be insanely happy\u000a\u000aWelcome and keep on vaping! 
p1361
aVAlmost ordered the fruit cereal. Think they may have been out on the 25mg though. Sweet tobacco?whats it taste like? I tried the juul virginia tobacco and tasted like a cig and an ashtray. LoL\u000a Think im trying to stay away from that.  Im more of a fruity guy. Had salt bae green apple. Sweet but i liked it.  Mr salt e cotton candy and strawberry. Mellow i thought but good. Recommend you try that grappleberry , not to sweet I thought, and thanks for the invite, you may be hearing from me
p1362
aVYeah., have not been on the cigs much at all. So tastes coming back i would think. That grappleberry i got was 10ml bottle but was in bundle with mi pod pods from the company. But maybe you can get just the bottle somewhere for the sample.  I liked the juul creme brulee, and maybe some point try for a coffee or dessert similar to that.  I had the ziip watermelon and strawberry in the juul. They were good. Think I am trying to satisfy my sweet tooth as well. Like i said imma fruity kinda guy. Haha  
p1363
aVTrying to switch from juul to new pod system: Novo, Mi-Pod, Orion, Renova Zero?\u000a\u000aI am a former cigarette smoker who tried to quit using various mods several years ago. None ever stuck, but I was finally able to kick cigs for good when I picked up the Juul. I have been smoking Juul pretty heavily for more than a year, and I really do love it, but the price is just getting out of range for me. I realized how much I have been spending on pods (go through one- one and a half a day on avg) and I want to switch to a refillable pod system vape with nic salts. \u000a\u000aWith the Juul I'm a fan of the compactness, simplicity, hit, draw, flavor (mango only), and lung feel. It is the closest to a cigarette I had tried. I've been looking into pod systems to make the switch. I've been trying to decide between: Smok Novo, Mi-Pod, Lost Vape Orion, and the Renova Zero. Heard good and bad about all of them to be honest. I want something that will be as satisfying as the Juul currently is, but I really don't know which I should go with. Any advise or suggestions?
p1364
aVI'm looking more into the Orion or the Mi-Pod. From what I've heard the Mi-Pod has a looser air flow, and I feel like that might not be satisfying to me.. anyone tried both and how does the airflow compare to the Juul? \u000a\u000aFor the Orion I've read it can be too harsh or complicated to use high concentration nic salts, any truth to that or way around it?
p1365
aVI have mipod. Air is loose but they have a restrictor you can put in pod to close the air flow. It tightens the flow but not as tight as the juul is. I have a juul akso i got when my first mipod faiked. My mipod problem is not getting more than 2-3 fills in a pod before it junks. And that 2-3 filks is if im lucky. Just ordered the orion myself. Waiting....
p1366
aVPurchasing a new pod system (advice)\u000a\u000aHave been doing research on the current pod systems and i am thinking of purchasing a lost vape orion. I Don\u2019t mind spending a little more on something that is quality, i currently have a Juul and have been just refilling the pods but im running low on empty pods and am getting tired of the leaks and all. Was wondering if anyone has a Orion and vapes nic salt out of it. I have been surfing reddit and cant seem to find a definitive answer. I currently am vaping 55 mg but wouldn\u2019t mind lowering the nic level. New to the pod system was a big cig smoker until i started juuling. So basically my question is how is does this product hold up, how is the pod availability am i always going to be able to order on line and also whats a good juice for someone who is more of a cigarette smoker not to concerned about massive flavor. Just looking for good vapor production and buzz. Thanks for the taking the time to help out a newbe in advanced!
p1367
aVI got a nautilus aio two weeks ago. It's my second vape after a juul, so I'm new to vaping. I think it's kind of shitty to be honest. The coils flood and burn my tongue with juice. The coil gets stuck in the pod if I turn too tightly. If I don't turn it tight, the pod won't click into place.
p1368
aVI found out Yesterday that JUUL pods contain Benzoic acid. Upon first glance I was like fuck is that not a part of anti D's? apparently it's a chemical that produces the throat hit in nicotine salts.
p1369
aVHey, I have an idea!  Let's give all the kids AR-15's and they'll stop killing themselves with Juuls.\u000a\u000aThere can't be any underage vaping if there are no kids!  *taps forehead*
p1370
aVSeriously, what kind of out of touch moron doesn't think that pretty much every school in the country has banned vapes? Now they want to make some kid forgetting his juul in his pocket a federal offense.
p1371
aVI just bought my first mod, voopoo drag 2, can you use nic salts in it? I'm very new to this. Moving over from a juul to save some money and reduce my nicotine intake. Sorry if it's a dumb question
p1372
aVDoing secret Santa at work. The person I got used Juul. Is there a cheaper place to get Juul pods than the Juul website? They want $7 shipping to ship a 4 pack of pods. I\u2019d much rather put that $7 towards another box of pods.\u000a\u000a
p1373
aVWhenever I'm looking for the lowest price on all things vape-related, I use vapecrawler.com. It's a price aggregator that pulls from sites in the USA, China, Canada and the Netherlands. You can exclude regions after you've made the search, and then organize the list by pricehigh/low or low/high) Give it a look:\u000a\u000ahttps://www.vapecrawler.com/results/juul%20pod
p1374
aVI've been eyeing up the Juul, although it seems all their pods come at 17mg which is pretty strong 
p1375
aVI'm gonna grab  Smok Novo off Amazon for 17 and give that a go! Aha Sounds quite like the Juul but stronger 
p1376
aVI thought this thread was going to be about Juul pods nicotine content from the title. LOL I don't think you can really put an actual number on it myself. Probably the stuff they don't know like if heating and inhaling the chemicals in flavorings will eventually be discovered to be carcinogenic. It's a definite as far a smokes but there are some things the jury is still out on as far as vaping.
p1377
aVHow to make a high nicotine salt juice DIY\u000a\u000aI am wondering how much PG, VG, Flavoring and nicotine I would need to get a 60mg/ml mix like the juul has.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aI am a retard and I didn't think before making my first diy.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aIn a 120ml bottle I put\u000a\u000a\u005c- 60ml 50/50 PG/VG premix\u000a\u000a\u005c- 40ml 20% nic salt\u000a\u000a\u005c- almost 20ml of flavoring\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aand i ended up at like 8mg/ml\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000ai'd imagine it would take a lot of ml of liquid to get a 60mg/ml mix, I want to make sure my calculations are correct before buying anything though\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aThanks
p1378
aVWhat's the Vg/Pg concentration of your 20mg/ml (aka 2%) salt nicotine base? If it's suitable to you, vape it straight, or add flavoring in small amounts so as not to dilute it too much.\u000a\u000aKeep in mind that the 60mg/ml Juul pod you're trying to emulate only contains 0.7ml, which means there is only about 42mg nicotine in the pod. Vape a couple ml of 20mg juice and you're just about there. \u000a\u000aBefore nicotine salts became a thing, people used to recommend 18mg/ml(1.8%) - 24mg/ml(2.4%) freebase for heavy smokers. I started with that and quit with ease. Many others have as well. So 20mg/ml nicotine salts ought to do it for you, salt or fbase. But if it's a stupid little fleeting buzz you're missing, I guess you're going to need a higher concentration or a better atomizer.
p1379
aVI smoked between a half pack and a whole pack a day for 18 years. JUUL (also 5%) helped me quit 2 years ago. But I graduated to the Orion recently and I love it. Best pod vape I\u2019ve used. And I\u2019ve used A LOT of them. 
p1380
aVI'd strongly advise you go with 2.5% maximum with the Orion. Higher nicotine strength doesn't always mean it's better to quit smoking with; a device like the Orion makes much bigger clouds than something like a Juul so it can mean you get nicotine poisoning very quickly.\u000a\u000aI personally vape mainly for nicotine and I use 25mg max in my Orion with either pod. They say the 0.5ohm is for flavour/MTLl and the 0.25ohm is for clouds/DTL  but it honestly comes down to which one you personally prefer for how you plan to use it as they're largely interchangeable. My personal preference is the 0.5ohm pod; I feel it has the edge on flavour for the juices I like to vape. You may feel differently so try both.
p1381
aVKind of seems like a moot point to argue but I honestly prefer the term "e-cigarette" to "vape". This depends entirely on your perception and the connotation these words carry to you, as an individual, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. I use a low-power nic salts setup specifically to curb my prior smoking habit and am not super interested in low-resistance builds on mech mods and chucking clouds. I consider "vapes" to be sub-ohm builds on high-watt devices made to use low or zero nic liquids and "e-cigarettes" to be low-power smoking cessation devices made to use high-nicotine liquids. I realize by using these arbitrary definitions a VW box mod and RTA could be either depending on user preference but they do different things and are sold to different markets. \u000a\u000a  \u000aThat said I feel like, to most analogue smokers, the phrase "vape" conjures images of headlines involving inconsiderate doucheflute suckers blowing clouds inside public buildings and underage kids getting hooked on juuls. "Vaporiser" works but only if the name proliferates, because as others have mentioned that can refer to anything from a non-combustion device made for weed to an aromatherapy device that dispenses scented fog to clear the air in a room, and if you're searching online for information about "vaporisers" you're gonna get a whole lot of chaff before you get to the wheat, so "e-cigarette" sticks for me.  \u000a
p1382
aVIf we gave all the kids AR-15's, they might stop killing themselves with Juuls.
p1383
aVIt's fucked up that mango Juul pods got banned before AR-15s
p1384
aVThe whole  "gateway drug " bullshit is self-perpetuating. If the "gateway" is unavailable, then a certain percentage of those who want it will try something else. In the case of weed, when it was illegal, the people selling it usually had more than just weed for sale... And if they ran out of weed, they'd try to upsell those coming to them for weed. If kids go to the corner store where the clerk doesn't give any shits about checking for ID and there's no Juul pods, maybe they will grab a pack of Camels or Lucky Strikes...\u000aMost times, the lack of the primary choice being available leads to trying something new...
p1385
aVFucking stupid. It\u2019s better juuls tham cigerretes or dip. They should just chill and stop making such a big deal out of it kids are always gonna do drugs of some form
p1386
aVTried to quit smoking, now I have two addictions\u000a\u000aI have a Juul and a KWIT currently, but I've been through several pod systems. I'm pretty happy with my KWIT stick but I can't stop researching devices. Anybody else use a device that works great but can't stop online shopping all the other options??? Seriously I bet I spend and hour a day constantly reading and watching reviews. About to buy a Vladdin RE for no good reason at all, I have about $180 worth of KWIT pods and Juice in my night stand right now.\u000a\u000aBTW don't buy the KWIT tobacco, its trash and I have two boxes of pods and a refill bottle of it (-\u005c_-) The rest are solid though.

aVLooking for advice on buying e-cig\u000a\u000aHi, I am looking to buy a e-cigarette for my heavy smoking father, he usually smokes the camel branded cigarette. I am looking to buy a simple to use e-cig like Juul, and has very similar e-juice flavour of camel branded tobacco, and if possible higher nicotine content. The purpose is help him switch to a healthier alternative. I am a person with no little to no knowledge on both e-cig and cigarette. \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aTHanks
p1388
aVUnfortunately, no type of e-liquid I know of tastes exactly like a cigarette. A JUUL or Juno may be a good place to start as they are very underwhelming. A refillable and cheaper option (in the long run) would be a pod system with nicotine salts. \u000a\u000aWhen I quit smoking, I went to 24mg nicotine on a mechanical mod with a dripper, but that is definitely not the best place to start. I would reccomend 12-18mg of nicotine as a start, with maybe a couple 6mg bottles if 12 is too strong. \u000a\u000aLook into pod systems for small and simple vapes. For bigger, more heavy duty vapes that have fantastic battery life and are incredibly durable, I would reccomend a GeekVape Aegis Legend kit (comes with a tank and two coils), with four 18650 batteries from LG, a plastic battery case for safe storage, and a smart charger that supports 18650 batteries. \u000a\u000aThere are loads of options that the other Redditors will probably reccomend, but these are the two that helped stay away from smoking.
p1389
aVSo why not a Juul? Everything you described is perfectly fitting for the Juul.  Get him a starer kit and a couple of packs of virginia tobacco.  He can upgrade to something better down the road after he's quit.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;
p1390
aVYou can't really get any easier than a simple JUUL set up with their tobacco pods. It's more expensive in the long run than most of our other vapes, but for somebody just making the switch and needs absolute simplicity, the JUUL is honestly a very solid choice.
p1391
aVI would say go with the Juul or (unpopular opinion warning) Vuse Alto.  Buy battery 2 units for backup and charge rotation. I think simplicity and availability is the key here, along with the high nic content of these devices.  You probably don't want him to have to fool around with refilling and changing coils, at least at first.  
p1392
aVDamn I finally went to buy myle refills last night and found out they don\u2019t sell in the US anymore. Sucks cus I was craving it so bad. Should I bother going around town to see if anyone has any left. \u000a\u000aAlso I don\u2019t feel like replacing it with a juul or cigarettes again. Anyone have a good goto brand with a good hit 
p1393
aVLooks great. I'd like to try it. Trying to move off of Juul.
p1394
aVI can't decide if it looks like a jewel (not Juul) orya high tech intergalactic communicator. But I like it. 
p1395
aVI'm impressed for the first time in a long time after switching to a juul from big mods. \u000a\u000aThis looks really great!.  Would love to get off the Juul train for a while. 
p1396
aVI like the sleek, unique, futuristic design! \u000a\u000aI like that it acts like a pod system, but you can refill it with your own juice. Juul pods are adding up and becoming expensive for me.\u000a\u000aSide note: the website on mobile cuts the page a little smaller than the words, so some words are cut off. 
p1397
aVI have found nothing works better to stop smoking than a Juul.  No muss, no fuss. That will get him past the hump, then a few months down the road he can look into something more flavorful and beefier.
p1398
aVAre you in Cuba too? Juuls are great for making the switch, as you use prefilled pods instead of filling a tank and replacing heating coils. Availability of pods and replacement parts (the charger is small and easy to lose) might be an issue in Cuba. I'm not sure, but I don't imagine they're readily available in Cuba. 
p1399
aVI\u2019m in Texas. And nothing in the spectrum of vaping is available in Cuba. People don\u2019t even know what vaping is lol. I would go for juuls but it\u2019d be so expensive to keep sending him pods. Idk if it\u2019s the most cost effective way.
p1400
aVThere are pod systems similar to juul, where you can keep refilling one pod. Once the pod has burnt out and isn't good anymore, you just throw it out and use a new pod. This ends up being much cheaper than a juul, but costs less money. I'm on my way home from work, I'll send you some more info in a little bit.
p1401
aVI have been using the tarot nano with a doggystyle for a while now. The size is great and performs much better than any pod...\u000a\u000aHere is a size comparison with the EQ, Juul and EGO AIO.\u000a\u000a[https://imgur.com/a/9E0mA5o](https://imgur.com/a/9E0mA5o)\u000a\u000aI haven't posted an image before, so hopefully the above is right...\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;
p1402
aVJuul. 
p1403
aVJuul
p1404
aVJuul.  Refillable pod systems are very nice and I love mine but the closest thing you will find to a cigarette is juul.  
p1405
aV&gt;Their initial efforts consisted of gathering information from e-cigarette producers and providing educational materials to teens on the health risks associated with vaping (**which e-cigarette companies were already doing**).\u000a\u000a&gt;the FDA raided e-cigarette industry leader Juul\u2019s headquarters and *seized over 1,000 pages* of documents (**at the time, Juul had already provided the FDA with over 50,000 pages of documents voluntarily**)\u000a\u000a&gt;In each of these cases, well-intended regulation yielded harmful unintended consequences.\u000a\u000aAnd didn't solve the original problem. But no no, they'll get it right *this time*, folks. And if not, then *next time*. They're just a couple of draconian crackdowns away from *getting it right*.
p1406
aVI\u2019m calling this now, Here\u2019s how juul regulations are going to affect market trade amongst teenagers. I\u2019m not advocating the reproduction of these actions, and do not stand for and encourage. When I was not even 18 I was in several positions to be able to obtain a 21+ ID to order off the official juul website and properly circumvent the California 21+ age law and order juul to base. This is just going to make some stupid profitable black market on high school grounds, and it\u2019s actually gonna make the problem worse.
p1407
aVThe problem is that In the EU juul pods are regulated, where US pods have 5% and EU pods have 1.7%. So technically not allowed to import, that beeing said my friend has sent me plenty from the US, so just stick it in a normal box, normal mail, it'll arrive. 
p1408
aVThat's probably more of a geographical thing. I live in the southwest and we don't have as many small corner stores or delis but there's a circle k in EVERY neighborhood and they sell vape products like Juul or Vuse things. Every head shop/smoke shop in my city has a vape section now. Even the reservation smoke shop that has a drive through that backs out on the streets for tax free tobacco sells vape gear. It's a far cry from a dedicated vape shop but the products are everywhere
p1409
aVLol my high school did this last year too, we were all seniors and it became a game of cat and mouse we all loved playing even more than our love of nic ( thank fuck I stopped juuling that shit ain\u2019t good for u)
p1410
aVI am looking to buy a vape for my heavy smoker father. He usually smokes the camel brand cigarette. I am looking to buy pod system like Juul that is very simple to use and the ejuice flavour is very similar to the camel brand cigarette with high amount of nicotine. Anyone knows which brand is capable of these?
p1411
aVI'm not very knowledgeable on the Juul, but there are many tobacco flavored ejuices. A lot of them have other flavors added to them, so it's hard to find a true tobacco flavor. Naked makes some pretty good tobacco juices like American Patriot, Euro Gold, and Cuban. I personally prefer Jon Wayne (JW) by Uncle Junks. It's a tobacco flavor with a hint of caramel. Someone else could maybe recommend a Juul pod with a tobacco profile.
p1412
aVYeah...They just dropped off the face of earth. They were going to send me mech V2 for review. A couple of weeks went by and I didn't hear anything so I sent my contact a message again just to check what was going on and he said things were crazy around there and it was shipping the following week. I never heard anything again and then they disappeared. LOL Oh well. I wonder if it has anything to do with Juul suing them?!?!?!
p1413
aVThey got sued into oblivion for copyright/patent infringement by Juul, did they not? 
p1414
aV&gt; I wonder if it has anything to do with Juul suing them?!?!?!\u000a\u000aIt was exactly that. They can send out products that had C&amp;D orders place on em. 
p1415
aVYeah, the little one that looked liked a Juul.
p1416
aVTo be fair, the pulse looked nothing like a juul.
p1417
aVSorry to bring this thread back up, but yes! I\u2019ve used a juul for over a year and never had this problem. Decided I should start filling my pods with NKD salt nicotine juices and the two lymph nodes under both ears and behind the jaw bone get bigger than normal and slightly ache at times.\u000a\u000aGot super anxious about it and went to the doctor, doctor said the size wasn\u2019t worrisome and had my blood taken and everything came back normal.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m beginning to think it has to do with the juice or what\u2019s in it, makes me want to just go back to buying juul\u2019s pods.
p1418
aVIs the Renovo Zero good?\u000a\u000aWhat I want to know:\u000a1. Is the flavor good*\u000a2. What VG/PG ratio is best\u000a3. Is it a good hit\u000a\u000a\u000a*I know flavor isn\u2019t even the best in pod systems, but is it good compared to JUUL, Hiro, Smok, etc.
p1419
aVI've only had it for about a week, so take my thoughts with a grain of salt. I like it. I think it hits pretty well, you have to draw decently hard. It reminds me of an actual cigarette in that respect. Flavor is not amazing, but seems on par with other pods I have tried(novo, juul, and something I can't remember the name of). I really like that it has adjustable power settings and an option to turn it off. It also has some kind of temp control that is suppose to stop dry hits. I haven't let my pod get down far enough to find out about that, but I like the idea of it. I have run juice from 50/50-75/25 and haven't had an issue. I think 75vg is already pushing it so I wouldn't go any higher than that. In order to get more cloud I prime it with a short puff before taking a full drag. I like it enough I bought one for my mom, she also enjoys it.\u000a\u000aDisclaimer: I normally vape with a csmnt rda on a therion in tc, so I didn't expect much from the flavor. Also, this hasn't been my main vape, so I can't comment on battery life(thought it seems solid) or pod longevity(I've only had it for a week).
p1420
aVYeah i tried 2 of the nic salt pods and the hit is complete terrible...Juul on the other hand has a great hit but can also thro you into coughing fits - but better than Myblu
p1421
aVI have mod but it\u2019s so big and annoying to carry around when I\u2019m out, what\u2019s the best and cheapest pod system?\u000a\u000aI\u2019m looking for a nice pod system I have a Juul and stopped using it as the price for pods are insane. I just want to keep my nice mod and tank at home while I\u2019m at the bars I just need a small pod system that is durable. Any suggestions?
p1422
aVWhat about using Sylo pods with your Juul?
p1423
aVTry the KWIT stick. Mine has been great, 5+ refills from the pods, quick charge, but most importantly it hits the same every time. Sometimes my Juul would hit great and sometime it hit like a completely different device. \u000a\u000aSidenote: Plug the bottom of the pod and take a draw until bubble come up after refills. I didn't do this once and burnt the shit out of pod on the first refill -\u005c_- but I never have to prime the pods like this unless its right after a refill.
p1424
aVAnyone familiar with Evolve DNA75c/DAN250c programming?\u000a\u000aIs there any way to set it so that it plays a gif or mp4 plays when the view button is pressed/held down?\u000a\u000aI wanna set my theme so that when I fire it, the screen flashes [rainbow strobe](https://youtu.be/PDdqRQOzQ6A) when firing, similar to the juuls party mode when it's pulled
p1425
aVVaping helped me stop smoking\u000a\u000aNot sure if this is the right place to share, be sure to let me know.\u000aNot all too much to say. I just wanted to share that I had been addicted to cigarettes since I was 16 years old. I can now officially say that I am done with smoking, due to my trusted juul and smok Badge! \u000a(Kinda a side note, I want to hear more about people who quit smoking thanks to their vapes. I can\u2019t stand seeing the Truth. Commercials say how vaping leads to smoking. I wanna hear good stuff from time to time) 
p1426
aVCongrats and welcome to the club. This whole sub is a contradiction of Truth's uhm...truth. \u000a\u000aBTW did you know each Juul pod contains as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes? /s
p1427
aVYou\u2019re also 4x more likely to smoke if you have a juul! (Even though TheTruth website even says not enough research has been about vaping and it\u2019s effects!)
p1428
aVCurrently 3 months off cigarettes and a week off the vape, feeing great. All the anti-vaping propaganda right now is really concerning, I truly could not have quit without the vape (tried unsuccessfully more than a few times) and i think it\u2019s a crime to try and deter others from following the same path to cessation all because tobacco companies are losing customers and a small percentage of kids (who would likely be smoking anyways) are getting hooked on juuls.\u000a\u000aCongrats on quitting, keep it up!
p1429
aVCongrats! I did the same. I smoked probably a pack or more a day for about 21 years. Finally, I got tired of being out of breath going up and down the stairs at work, so I bought a Juul. Haven't had a cigarette since April. I never could have done it without vaping. A couple weeks after I quit, I tried smoking a cig again, and after two puffs I put it out and get rid of the ones I had left cause it tasted so horrible!\u000a\u000aI just saw a couple of those TRUTH commercials the other night for the first time. Really pissed me off, all that misinformation being spouted. 
p1430
aV#JuulGang Thank you for taking the time to comment. I\u2019m glad that you took the initiative and got rid of that awful habit of smoking. A juul really helped me too! The truth commercials are just stupid, I can\u2019t stand them either. They should take a look at these comments and see how many people are off smoking! But congrats on quitting the sick habit, here\u2019s to never looking back! 
p1431
aVHonestly! I heard a while back that there is a push to make vaping 21+, with some stores around where I live already doing that for juul pods. So what do they expect for me to do? Just go back to smoking? Fine then. \u000a\u000aAlso, not necessarily directed at you, but really anyone who reads this. With the example I kinda just gave, in which the age for vapes is 21 and up, and people who are addicted go back to smoking... is it possible to sue the government for that? Like, years down the road and you develop a smoking related disease, can you sue the government for essentially forcing you to stick to smoking? I\u2019m just curious, and wonder if that could be a way to fight legislation that has passed or will pass\u000a

aVLooking for a cheap beginner vape pen for my mum (UK)\u000a\u000aHey guys, my mum quit cigarettes long time ago for 10 years but got back on smoking unfortunately. She intends to quit, but we all know how hard that is. I thought I'd surprise her with a vape pen and hopefully help her quit one more final time.\u000a\u000aShe absolutely hates big vapes like mine (Wismec RX Gen3) and the plastic drips that go into your mouth. I thought about the Vaporesso pens and other brands but she told me she'd never use it. (too big, mostly metal, hates re-filling)\u000a\u000aI got my eyes on the JUUL vape and although I see how more expensive it could be for vapers like myself who smoke a lot and refill a lot, but I think 20 for the starter kit is a fair price for her type of use. (then 9.99 /4 pods) Has anyone been in a similar situation, if so, what devices did you look at or picked up?\u000a\u000aAny other brands that you have good experience with and is similar to JUUL? (both in terms of design, mouthpiece, pods/refillable pods &amp; price?\u000a\u000a*PS: Please do not recommend me any SMOK products, I honestly only had negative experience from their products and coils. I do see how great they can be, and some are legitimately make me want to switch at times, but I rather stick with another brand.*
p1433
aVIf she is dead against refilling a device then the Juul is a good option.  As it seems that you are aware it is much cheaper to run a refillable pod system.  Suroin drop/air and the Vaporesso Nexus are two that i enjoy.
p1434
aVYeah; if she hates refilling I'd go with the Juul just now. The most important thing at this point is getting her off the snouts. If in future, she thinks she's missing out on being able to try flavors that you have that she likes the sound of, then that's a conversation for then, but don't put obstacles or potential objections/excuses in the way at the moment mate.
p1435
aVNothing wrong with the Juul but I\u2019d take a punt with the Bo one. More pods for the money and I get a better hit with the 16mg freebase compared to 20 in Juul salts. Pesky uk laws!
p1436
aVI've had a Suorin Air and currently use the Drop for my salts. \u000a\u000aFunctionally the Drop and Air are the same. I think the juice capacity is slightly higher on the Air, but not meaningfully so. I had some issues with auto-firing and coil wicking with the Air - I think Suorin sorted most of their problems out with the Drop.\u000a\u000aI will be frank though - there's a reason why Juul caught so much market share so quickly. For the uninitiated smoker who doesn't want to fiddle, it just plain works. Even though you and I know the obvious advantages of superior products (value, better flavor, better economics) I've found that, especially when someone like your mom is just starting out, just give her something that works. No mess, no hassle. If she can stick to the Juul, it won't be long before she's hitting you up for something better. :)

p1438
aVI don't think either, as some sort of feature in modern open world game perhaps, but vaping in gaming industry (even by gamers who vape) would not be taken so seriously to attempt and craft a video game specializing on in vaping trend, it's simply financially inefficient and nothing replaces the physical coil building compared to rotting eyes in front of screen for filling a 3D modeled tank, although for the memes (like juuling) as parody game it might work out.
p1439
aVMarlboro makes plans to acquire large percentage of Juul\u000a\u000a
p1440
aVMeh. It is hardly surprising. As revenue from cigarette sales drop, they will want to get more somehow.\u000a\u000aBetter they get vape stuff then find a new way to get folks to smoke. They have a vastly better distribution system too, so you'll end up seeing Juul stuff in far more places, and you might end up seeing more flavors and such.\u000a\u000aAll in all, I don't see this as a bad thing, per se.
p1441
aVJuul is so profitable as it is, it\u2019d be a waste. 
p1442
aVBecause juul has so much market share in ecigs that it\u2019s not worth it 
p1443
aV&gt;Wouldn't be unheard of to buy your competition and kill it to sell more of your own.\u000a\u000a...or you could sell both and cast a wider net for more customers. Altria doesn't lose money if someone goes from their cigarettes to JUUL; they're still buying from the same company. Indeed, if someone moves from a competitor's cigs to JUUL, that's a new customer.\u000a\u000aThis is what was done with blu, a decent-ish product line bought out by a cigarette giant. Philip Morris International currently sells both heat-not-burn and e-cigs, actively promoting them over smoking. These businesses are acclimating to swiftly changing consumer preferences to stay afloat. Altria is not going to can JUUL just to keep selling a product that faces ever more regulatory pressure and declining sales in its biggest markets.
p1444
aVsoo 2 things can happen\u000a\u000a1. buying Juul and marlboro will make quality ejuices.\u000a\u000a2. buying juul and marlboro will shelf it and makt that brand look bad and make people go back to tobacco\u000a\u000ahmm? 
p1445
aVOh, it's been in the plans behind the scenes for a very long time, that is why I get so many downvotes whenever I point out that Juul is in on it and it's all a fake show to manipulate public opinion and keep big tobacco in control. No one believes me, but I will say I told you so soon enough.
p1446
aVI doubt that. They\u2019re not stupid. Juul has the kind of mindshare and market share that most companies can only dream of. Hell, half the young people in the country call vaping \u201cjuuling\u201d. So it\u2019d be like a company buying the brand \u201cKleenex\u201d then dismantling it, in other words, incredibly stupid. And if there\u2019s something tobacco companies aren\u2019t, it\u2019s stupid.
p1447
aVThat's a pretty horrible headline, from a couple points.\u000a\u000a"Marlboro" is not the company, it's Altria Group, and "large percentage" doesn't convey the fact that they're not even after a majority of shares.\u000a\u000aWhat this would accomplish is preserving Juul as a company/brand longer than is likely without a buy-in from an established group. Juul is a very young company that has grown quite rapidly, and is looking at the potential of getting completely dismantled if some special-interests have their way.
p1448
aVI don't see how you can take that stance, if you want Juul to survive.
p1449
aVDisclaimer: not an expert.\u000a\u000aThere was a study that showed negative effects of vaping that was posted here, and one of the complaints was that all the vapes tested used copper coils (they were all Big Tobacco ecigs - Blu, Mark10), and that was maybe the reason for the chemical or particle observed in vapor. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a reason behind that.\u000a\u000aI also agree that, especially in the wake of this FDA scare, I can't say I'm overwhelmingly opposed to some Big Tobacco lobbying behind what has become the poster child of vapes.\u000a\u000aAfter all, I don't think they care about our health either way, bad *or* good - they just want money. To that end, it would be in Marlboro's best interest to maintain Juul and not sabotage it. Hell, it would seem to me Juul has a better market share against Blu, Vuse and Mark10 compared to Marlboro vs. Camel and Maverick, they may find themselves better served by making a big push towards ecigs.
p1450
aVIf that was the situation they would have snatched them up two years ago when they were struggling to ramp up production and could not handle supplying more than 500 small vape shops with product. \u000a\u000aToday JUUL has all that shit worked out.  They have massive production facilities, and distribution that is more than effective in supplying every retail outlet in North America that wants the products.  It used to take a 6-8 month wait for a retailer to get a chance to carry JUUL.  Today any shop can place a high volume order and have it delivered in 48 hours or less. \u000a\u000aThey kicked Marlboro's ass at their own game.  Suddenly it was Marlboro that could not handle production and distribution on its own vapor products. Meanwhile this startup company with less than 5 years in the business was distributing more product to more retailers with higher margins.\u000a\u000aMarlboro wants to buy them because they did a better job producing and shipping a better product for pennies on the dollar.  They see the writing on the wall, they have to buy in or lose out. 
p1451
aVIt was only a matter of time and the reality is, Marlboro has enough money to start their own brand to compete with Juul, they can undercut them on pricing, flood the market and put Juul out of business.  But it's obviously easier for Marlboro to buy a huge stake in the company.  Juul really has no choice.
p1452
aVNot surprised.  I stopped using Juul when they announced all their restrictions a couple weeks ago.   \u000a\u000a\u000aI chose not to support a company that won't stick up for themselves, and instead just cave to unfounded pressure, you know, bEcAuSe WhAt AbOuT tHe ChIlDrEn???
p1453
aVUnfortunately the divide between open system (mods/tanks/bottles of liquid) and closed system (cigalikes and pod systems like Juul) is growing, and it wouldn't susprise me to see two separate sets of regulation for them respectively, much like we see today with cigarettes/cigars and "premium" cigars.\u000a\u000aWhat those two separate regulations will look like remain to be seen. I just hope they're favorable enough to both that we can continue with the success we've *all* had getting smokers to quit. At the end of the day that's all that matters.
p1454
aVThey aren\u2019t trying to buyJUUL to kill it with Iquos. The Iquos isn\u2019t popular as has been mentioned in the comments a few times it\u2019s not even for sale here yet. the Iquos is a dry herb vape for premade tobacco sticks and it\u2019s never going to set the world on fire. The JUUL is a better mousetrap the Iquos is the answer to a question nobody is asking. 
p1455
aVThat\u2019s my fear at this point. I don\u2019t know the figures on usage between open and closed system vaping but I wouldn\u2019t put it past Big Tobacco to use their power to ensure closed systems get the monopoly.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019d be better if they took a page from the brewing industry\u2019s relationship with craft beer, IMO. The Juul buyout has the *potential* to do that, but I won\u2019t hold my clouds. 
p1456
aVAs long as they keep it reasonable and don\u2019t impose flavor bans, I could see that working.  Juul and the other pod systems just don\u2019t have the flavor I find that I need - I used pretty much all the cigalikes before I finally bought a mod and I would inevitably still be drawn back to analogs.  Now, I\u2019d have a hard time going back to those tar rags. 
p1457
aVI don't think this is inherently a bad thing. They aren't after the majority of their shares and this could provide stability for Juul while increasing profits for a corporation that's losing profits in a dying industry.\u000a\u000aCompare it to oil companies investing in biofuels and renewable energy.
p1458
aVVaping is dead, smoking is the future.\u000a\u000aSeriously though, fuck all this noise. I started vaping, and working in the industry, to NOT keep feeding big tobacco.\u000a\u000aNow they own most of the domestic wholesalers, and now they're buying up what, 90% of the market? I know juul is way up there.\u000a\u000aI guess I finally need to kick nicotine.
p1459
aVIf you think major tobacco industries were going to go away that's stupid.  They will change direction and move to diversify the market with things such as easy vape tools like Juul and soon most likely cannabis products like vape cartridges ie heavy hitters 
p1460
aVMarlboro is a brand, not a company. The company that makes the brand Marlboro is Philip Morris. The group that owns Philip Morris is Altria, which is the group that's looking to invest in Juul.\u000a\u000aSaying "Marlboro is trying to acquire a large percentage of Juul" is factually incorrect on multiple levels. There's no indication from the article that the investment group Altria has any intention to associate Juul with any other companies it owns, even if they could (they're attempting to acquire a minority of shares), and if the talks in which they're engaging lead to such an acquisition.\u000a\u000aAccuracy is important, especially considering the loose way that those opposed to vaping present "facts" in attempts to hurt the industry.
p1461
aVCarfentynyl flavored juul pds coming soon...
p1462
aVThere\u2019s a lot of ways this could go. I\u2019ve been in business over 40 years. I\u2019ve seen businesses take over other businesses just to shut that business down. They get the rights to the technology so no one legally can use it. Vaping is popular so why not continue Juul? Well for one thing a lot of competition already out there. New and better pod systems appearing daily taking away Juul profits. So in end how many new vapers going to stick with Juul after finding better products? If Juul ( as a vaping device to help quit smoking)becomes accepted then by default Other vaping devices have to be acknowledged as safe. Something the FDA and anti vaping advocates are refusing so far to do.   Juul is being targeted by the press , FDA and anti vaping groups at the moment concerning everything from false Cancer \u201cresearch \u201c reports to hysteria over Teen vaping. ( of course reports don\u2019t mention how many more teens using cigarettes than vapes ) So if Juul disappears and FDA continues to clamp down on Vapers ... old school tobacco products and their  offspring profit margins once again go up. 
p1463
aVWhy wouldn\u2019t Juul just go and IPO? Far more valuable and could crush these ancient cig companies. \u000a\u000aLazy way of making a shit ton of money in my opinion. 
p1464
aVMaybe you should, because that's not what the term means.\u000a\u000aA loss leader is some item that technically loses money per unit, but also causes other, more profitable items to be bought.\u000a\u000aAn example that would fit this situation would be if the Juul device itself cost more to make and ship than it sold for, but when people bought them they would also end up buying a bunch of the pods which are profitable to sell; the end result is that a product that actually loses you money to sell ends up causing you to make money.
p1465
aVIncorrect. While it is true that hostile takeovers and the eventual elimination of the competition are standard practice, that is only when there is not brand loyalty, and when there is not brand loyalty a product that could still make you money is not destroyed or tossed aside (meaning production ceases while you retain the patent). What you do is take over the competition, take all of it's stuff that you can use (in this case, the Juul patents and such) and you toss anything else (BT's marketing department, whatever in-house legal they might have, etc) away.\u000a\u000aThe idea that it is common practice to spend piles of money on a thing and they throw it away forever (effectively burning money for no return) makes me wonder who the hell taught you economics, if you took the class at all.
p1466
aVI just don't like their attitude. They claim to stand for the people that are trying to quit while at the same time, they're making deals with the very same companies they vowed to fight against.\u000a\u000a It's honestly so disrespectful against the people that are really fighting to quit. It's like Juul is saying that they really don't care about the people and just want to make a profit. \u000a\u000aI understand their point of view but I just find the whole situation a public embarrassment for Juul and should serve as an example of just how far these companies will go to make a quick buck. 
p1467
aVI had a smok infinix with the same problem, one of my gold pins was stuck down, I did what you said with a old juul pod and it fixed ittt 
p1468
aVI just did the same thing and it worked! Literally the only thread that has an actual solution. I saw one post where someone said to put aluminum foil to complete the connection, but that didn\u2019t work for me. An old juul pod prong works. It\u2019ll do until I get around to getting another device. Thanks for the post!
p1469
aVokay so if your gold pin connector literally disappeared like mine did and you don't gold plate from an old juul literally find an actual gold earring and use the part that goes thru your ear and slid it where the gold pin used to be and it'll work just as good as before. it took me two hours but the shit actually works, you're welcome.
p1470
aVIkr. But yeah I'd like to fix this mod or hope that it's just batteries because I traded my shitty juul for it. I had an alien but the nod got fried, wont turn on or plug into pc. 
p1471
aVAre they Juul pods? Prolly fine 
p1472
aV&gt; Now I get moody and irritated when I don't have it, if I forget when I leave I have panic attacks, shit, just thinking about stopping gives me panic attacks.\u000a\u000aAre you sure that isn't just a mental/self control thing, it's not really that serious, I slowly stopped juuling after vaping it pretty heavy for months and never had any of that, I know everyone is different but in your title you're speaking for more than yourself
p1473
aVevery juul goes that high and they have almost 75% of the vape market ffs
p1474
aVThey know it's not *really* that serious. But the fact that it's happening is disconcerting. You're right that there is a mental component to it, but nicotine is crazy addictive. This is what happens when you have had a lot of it and then suddenly have none. \u000a\u000aI smoked cigarettes occasionally for a couple years, then did mainly mod vaping for a year, then switched to a juul for the past year or so. I have had a pretty similar experience to OP.\u000a\u000aI am definitely the most addicted to nicotine now more than ever. Which I think is *that* serious. 
p1475
aVJuuls are 50mg I think 2 ml per pod nic salts which is why they claim a pod is equivalent to a pack of ciggies\u000a\u000aA month ago I transitioned from 5-6 ciggies per day to 5ml of 6mg juice and I've been doing fine. I got a Cascade One Plus SE and refill the tank once per day, that's all I allow myself to vape because if I could I would just keep this thing next to me all day and go through a 30ml bottle in one day instead of a week like I do now.\u000a\u000a
p1476
aVI mainly vape 3mg max VG juices in a sub ohm tank, and I never intensely crave nicotine, but when I switched to a Juul for just a few days during a vacation, I started to get serious cravings when I didn't have the device. So using high nic might help some people but to me it was infinitely more addicting than 3mg or even 6 ever was. 
p1477
aVI'm not pulling facts out of my ass. Ask a time who used a juul.
p1478
aVDefinitely not a popular thing to discuss but I agree with you. I used a Juul for a while and after a bit I was going through a pod a day easily and sometimes more, and it felt so much more addictive than freebase. I know that panic feeling when you don't have any nic salt around. Now I'm down at 1.5mg and 3mg and I almost never leave the house with my vape. I'm fine going all day without it and enjoy it more when I get home and take a few drags. And stopping for a day or two is easy. I've talked to plenty of people on here who say they can't go more than 2hrs without it and I understand it but it doesn't have to be that way at all. \u000a\u000aWith any drug, the least amount necessary is always the best. It's easy to get addicted to 50mg salt nic but it's so unnecessary. I think most people would be completely fine with 3-6mg but of course high dose is more satisfying and fun. Obviously some just don't care about it though and I can respect that too. Glad you brought this controversial subject up OP! 
p1479
aVJuuls aren't,a,fiar comparison. They use WTA liquid.
p1480
aV&gt;Juuls are 50mg I think 2 ml per pod nic salts\u000a   \u000a   Juuls are 59 mg/ml and 35 mg/ml. But each pod contains less than 1 ml of juice, so the pods actually contain 24 or 41 mg nicotine each.\u000a   \u000aI pretty much agree with the rest of what you said, though. High strength nicotine is probably overkill for someone who only smoked one-fouth of a pack a day. \u000a   \u000aOn the other hand, 6mg freebase in an evod is not enough for a long-time pack-a-day smoker. Yet that's what a local vape shop recommended for my sister and she never quit smoking and gave up on vaping altogether.\u000a   \u000aShe'd have been better off if she'd have gone to a convenience store and got a Juul. But this was pre-Juul. High strength nicotine salts hadn't been introduced to the market yet. \u000a   \u000aHeavy smokers who switch to vaping should always try to err on the high side when choosing nic level. It's more important that they get a good experience than worry about a little excess nicotine.
p1481
aVSo about 52mg per day, about the same as u/Badazd, but more than a high-strength pod-a-day Juul user, and less than me (12mg x 5ml = 60mg).
p1482
aVWhere is this information coming from? Not Juul Labs, afaik.
p1483
aVYes, and please everyone, stay away from closed devices entirely other than when in a pinch. Let ANY prefilled device be "IN A PINCH" only. Let them be "my battery is dying, buying a disposable" or "I am going to ____ event, better grab a Vuse" or whatever - don't use these things for convenience, it's not an excuse. Use these in a pinch. CLOSED DEVICES mean CLOSED MARKETS. CLOSED DEVICES mean SAME BOAT WE WERE IN WITH CIGARETTES. Juul controversies are mass manipulation. I am telling you: OPEN SYSTEMS are VERY IMPORTANT. If you must use pods or cigalikes, use open refillable empty systems. Do not make your daily drive prefilled shit. Those CLOSED companies USE THAT MONEY to fight AGAINST the vaping industry you love and FOR a "new mask" for the taxation through addiction that Cigarettes are. They gave generation after generation cigarettes at war for free. SPECIFICALLY to addict them. NOW they are telling your kids Juul are bad (so that your kids WANT them) - SEE IT. SEE THE TRUTH.
p1484
aVThey ran Joe the Camel ads during Saturday morning cartoons. If Juul ads are following baby shark videos on youtube you've got an argument. Otherwise it's just more drawing at straws.   \u000aAnd what does Florida care about kids vaping for anyhow?  I didn't think considering future repercussions of things was legal in Florida lol
p1485
aVits been great so far. i usually take a juul or stlth to work, so i havnt used it as much as ive wanted. but i like it. also, my first voopoo device.
p1486
aVHello everyone,\u000aQuestion for you guys. I\u2019ve been vaping for a couple years, and I recently tried the juul. I loved it, and went out and bought one. I like how it\u2019s draw activated, feels more like a cigarette, the pen shape/design, and the convenience of pods (simpler, less messy and complex). What I don\u2019t like is how fast it dies, and the pods are a little expensive (that\u2019s not as big of a deal as the battery though). Any other alternatives with the aspects I like with a longer battery life?
p1487
aVI use the Juul at 50mg, and use a pod a day. I'm trying to replicate that as best I can
p1488
aVEven an mtl setup will put out MUCH MORE vapor than the juul. 
p1489
aVDamn dude I'm sorry to hear that. I'm having such a hard time processing how cigs/pipes are totally fine, but you couldn't sneak a juul and stealth hit it without letting any vapor come out.\u000a\u000aHope you'll stay strong! Since you aren't breaking your connection to nicotine fully (still vaping etc), consider some nicotine gum or patches for when you can't vape. Certainly not ideal, but can still get a fix without having to light up!!
p1490
aVthere probably will be companies that try to fly under the radar, but no new companies will show up legally. \u000a\u000apretty much every ejuice brand that manufactures salt nicotine juice is illegal, and if shut down, would give juul and maybe a couple others full manopoly over that portion of the industry.\u000a\u000afucked up if you ask me
p1491
aVUse nicotine salt in 1.2 ohm coil tank\u000a\u000aI\u2019m getting really tired of using my Aspire Breeze 2 and the coil getting flooded not even in a day or burning in 2, So i\u2019m trying to find yet another vape for nic salt i\u2019ve had the juul the surion air and drop both died and this one now, i want to just get s regular style vape that has 1.2 ohm coils would that work? as long as i stay around a 12w max if not could anyone help a brother out with some good nic salt vapes that don\u2019t burn so fast. Thanks a ton if so!\u000a\u000aTLDR; Tried of breeze 2 coils being ass, wondering if a regular vape with 12w max and 1.2ohm coils be fine for 50mg nic salt? if not what\u2019s a good vape that doesn\u2019t burn so fast, Thanks

aVYou think the FDA is just going to stop with Juul and gas stations? \u000a\u000aYou think the omg think of the children city governments are going to stop at that?

p1494
aVUnfortunately most of the shops that offered even somewhat of a decent variety have closed down. The one B&amp;M I go to very occasionally has almost no coils (besides the Chinese 800 packs for $6) and only one or two Rebuildable atomizers that are over a year old. I try to understand why they aren\u2019t capitalizing on the seasoned vapers and it\u2019s because they don\u2019t even know what an experienced vaper is! SMOK this or WISMEC that, I told them to carry some low to mid end drippers and RTA\u2019s and people that have been vaping awhile will start to trickle in. No one wanted to listen so I don\u2019t buy anything from them except a new juice here and there. It\u2019s a damn shame that there\u2019s not some kind of educational class on current vaping trends these shops could utilize. Until then, SMOK starter kits and JUUL\u2019s will be all we see in these wack B&amp;M Vape shops.

aVArticle saying vaping may be more dangerous than smoking. Brain damage, damage to DNA... Link says vaping but when you read the article it focuses on juuling. Either way, I don't believe it.\u000a\u000a

aV"...Studies suggest that Juul devices and \u201cvaping\u201d can lead to problems  with brain development, lung damage, increased risk for high blood  pressure and increased risk for nicotine/smoking addiction..."\u000a\u000a\u005c- So it's not air and does the same thing as cigarettes\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a"...It uses a battery and contains a solution of nicotine, flavorings, and other chemicals, some of which may be harmful.\u201d ([2](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/electronic-cigarette)) \u000a\u000a\u005c- Failing to  enunciate the 5 chemicals is amazing.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a"...there\u2019s evidence that Juuls may be doing more harm than good."

aVPlease Stop Spreading Misinformation RE: Juul's Alleged 70% Market Share\u000a\u000aJuul does NOT have a 70% share of the US vaporizer market. It has a 70% share of a *specific segment* of the market - the brick &amp; mortar mass retail segment, which includes convenience stores, gas stations, drug stores, and grocery.\u000a\u000aOnline sales, Vape Shop sales, and Tobacco Shop sales are NOT included in [the Nielsen market data](https://www.cpgdatainsights.com/get-started-with-nielsen-iri/xaoc-and-mulo/) from which [that 70% bullshit](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iHdKiRLXNv2Q/v1/-1x-1.png) comes.\u000a\u000a&gt;...Nielsen data tracks the electronic-cigarette mass channel and convenience-store marketplace. Vaporizers, which typically are lower in price, are sold mostly in tobacco and vapor shops, where Nielsen has limited tracking.\u000a&gt;\u000a&gt;The distinction is important given that $3 billion of the $4.4 billion in e-cig and vaporizer revenue Herzog projected for 2017 comes from the vaporizer sector....\u000a&gt;\u000a&gt;https://www.journalnow.com/business/business_news/local/vuse-falls-further-behind-juul-on-e-cig-sales/article_ed14c6bc-5421-5806-9d32-bba0e8f86571.html  \u000a  \u000a  \u000a&gt;The companies launched the copycat devices as Juul\u2019s market share surged from 13.6 percent of the e-cigarette market in early 2017 to more than 70 percent now, according to a Wells Fargo analysis of Nielsen retail data, which does not include online sales. \u000a&gt;\u000a&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vaping-regulation-juul-specialreport/special-report-juul-copycats-flood-e-cig-market-despite-fda-rule-idUSKCN1M418W\u000a  \u000a  \u000a&gt;...And while JUUL is extraordinarily popular, it doesn\u2019t own half of the vaping market. It does however account for more than half of the sales dollars in the convenience store/gas station retail sector, the part of the vape market tracked by Nielsen. But that portion of vapor product sales itself is less than 40 percent of the total. Sales in specialty vape shops and through online retailers accounts for more than 60 percent of total vaping industry volume. So JUUL\u2019s market share is probably close to 20 percent of the total.\u000a&gt;\u000a&gt;https://vaping360.com/juul/juuling/\u000a  \u000a  \u000aThat last article, written by Jim McDonald, also states that "JUUL Labs is not owned by a tobacco company. Like almost all of U.S. e-cigarette manufacturers, JUUL is independent and not affiliated with the tobacco industry".\u000a\u000aObviously, the article was written prior to yesterday's Wall Street Journal report that Altria is negotiating with Juul on a minority stake in the company. I know some people think Juul has been working with big tobacco all along. Please save it. I just wanted to point out that the 70% thing is just another bit of the same old BS that we can't avoid stepping-in but shouldn't be tracking into the house.
p1502
aVSure but those online shop, head shops, and vape stores all carry Juul and sometimes other gas station brands. \u000a\u000a
p1503
aVI think it's telling when you look at the majority of articles that cite this information - most talk about JUUL and underage use. \u000a\u000aThese are the readily available numbers available for reporters when they went looking. And since they were looking for a boogeyman to the main point of their articles, underage use, and not writing an article about ecig market representation they didn't bother digging deeper. \u000a\u000aBecause that would require actual research.
p1504
aV&gt;Nah. I'm still going to rail against closed systems.\u000a\u000aGo ahead, I don't like closed systems either. I like rebuildables and DIY liquid. \u000a\u000aWhat does that have to do with Juul's actual market share and all the misinformation about it? You're not saying you're going to help spread the BS because you don't like Juul, are you? Lol, I don't think that's what you mean. But your comment seems only tangentially related to the post unless I'm misunderstanding it?
p1505
aV&gt;Call it whatever. It's willful ignorance at best. I've seen it repeated so many times in the process of googling this info that 'purposeful' seems like a more appropriate word to me.\u000a\u000aOr, ya know, the reporter Google's "JUUL", sees the stat, and then uses it. Further reporters do that, which makes those stories with those stats more likely to pop up on search engines and appear more collaborated, and boom, that's what everyone reports. You know how you couldn't always find the source of that data? That's because a lot of them likely cited other articles rather than citing the data directly. The alternative here would be spending weeks trying to aggregrate data from various sources, likely relying on a lot of cooperation from stores and sites they contacted and then extrapolating from that, to come up with a stat that, while more correct, is tangential to the point of their story.\u000a\u000aThese reporters were likely told "Hey, this is some news that seems to be trending, write on this and make it clickable. Don't spend too much time, just hit the key facts others are reporting." Most of them likely don't care. Most of their editors likely don't care. But people on Facebook share the story so they've got to have something on it.\u000a\u000aAs far as the FDA is concerned, they don't seem to have access to a lot of this data either (because it literally doesn't exist). They used the Nielsen date (which is correct, but not *complete*), combined with their focus of sales at non-specialty physical stores (at which point that data is correct *and* complete) to identify the biggest players in the relevant niche of the market they want to regulate further. Coincidentally, these are also the players they can actually regulate as far as devices, as the other major manufacturers are Chinese without US based operations.\u000a\u000aAgain, man, I agree with your premise that the 70% figure is wrong as far as the market as a whole is concerned and shouldn't be quoted on here.
p1506
aVJuul doesn't have 70% of the brick and mortar market. Juul owns the market in stores where they only carry cigalikes. In stores where they carry a variety of non-pod devices and ejuices, all the money comes from repeat juice sales, coil sales, and sales of higher end mods to new Vapers. Those Vapers are the ones who started with Juuls. Pure vape shops carry like 10-20 different mods, 20-50 eJuice options, and various tanks, coils and supplies. \u000a\u000aAnd you really think they do this because 70% or their income comes from selling Juuls?\u000a\u000aSource: multiple shop owners
p1507
aVAnd there are how many convenience stores in each of those 35,000 recognized towns? Towns are not boroughs, cities, or other forms of organized populace, either. So how many boroughs and cities? About 35,000 of those, too, I bet. \u000a\u000aBut the more important point from the beginning: How many convenience stores in each of those towns? How many in the boroughs? How many in the cities? 20 convenience stores to every vape shop. EASILY. 20 places to buy juul to every 1 vape shop. 10 people in line at any given Sheetz or Wawa buying tobacco and electronics, no one in the vape shop up the road.\u000a\u000aLots of sightings of juuls and vuses, I'm pretty lonely with my box mod... It's all just obvious. Yes, they are fudge numbers, but they are easy to fudge from everyday experience and simple logic. 35,000 vape shops? 154,958 convenience stores. See it from a new angle.
p1508
aVI wrote 2014 for a reason. That was 4 years ago, and vape shop numbers have doubled year over year in years leading up to 2014, and no one's tracked Nationwide in a while.\u000a\u000aSure, convenience stores are aplenty. But what exactly is your point? Do you have anything beyond "I see ppl buying juuls", or do you actually have something besides anecdotal non-statistical opinion on the matter?\u000a\u000aI have been to a shit ton of vape shops over the past years and I've never seen anyone buy a Juul. I've seen plenty of packed vape shops, and plenty of people buy refillable pod systems. Does that mean my version of "obvious logic" trumps yours? \u000a\u000aLet's just agree to disagree.\u000a

aV Since you like hard info, I have a few fancy numbers that I hope explain where I'm coming from better.\u000a\u000aAccording to Physicians Weekly, "*JUUL Laboratories\u2019 average annual market share of total e-cigarette sales increased 515 percent during 2016 to 2017, from 2 to 13 percent. JUUL Laboratories\u2019 sales comprised 29 percent of total e-cigarette sales by December 2017, giving it the largest market share."* \u000a\u000aAnd the competitors that are being swallowed by Juul in each and every single one of these studies?  British American Tobacco, the leader in marketshare from 2014 to 2017. You know, BIG BritishAmericanTobacco, the huge behemoth behind super popular ecigarettes like Vype. If you haven't heard of them, it's actually because they're not famous - they're just another convenience store brand sold only to vaping newcomers.\u000a\u000aThe other brands in this marketshare pie chart? Altria's MarkTen, Imperial Tobacco, and companies like Vuse and V2 Pro. That's right - literally all starter kit sellers. The big 70% market that keeps getting passed around is a who's who of nobody in the vaping industry, except for Juul. [https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/02/juul-e-cigarette-sales-have-surged-over-the-past-year.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/02/juul-e-cigarette-sales-have-surged-over-the-past-year.html)\u000a\u000aIt doesn't count refillable pod makers. It doesn't count the people who manufacture 3rd party pods to fit the Juul. It doesn't count Chinese companies or their products. It doesn't even count ejuice manufacturers. It literally only counts the brands you see at gas stations, convenience stores and Rite Aids. Okay - you say, but Juul sold over a billion dollars in 2018! That is clearly above what VooPoo, VandyVape, Smok and all of them do, right?\u000a\u000aNobody knows how much they make, because they're in China and they don't have to tell you. But do you know who bought the 1 billion+ in product from Juul? The same convenience stores, the same gas stations and the same Rite Aids and CVS-type stores that are around the country. \u000a\u000aTheir sales are from selling orders directly to the stores. Not to consumers. The sales heated up because Juul made the news, and every retailer with a brain said if these things are selling, I'mma buy some and put them on my shelves. \u000a\u000aI don't doubt the the idea that they're trying  turn vaping into a closed monopoly at all. I've tried one before - and they're really convenient, so I can see why they're successful. It's a great marketing plan tbh; if you turn the public media against your product, it gets free advertising for like a year and teens see it plastered 24/7.\u000a\u000aBut that's not really the point of what we're talking about. Juul isn't nearly as commanding of a market behemoth as they've been made out to be - and that's what I'm trying to communicate. 70% of brick and mortar? Not even remotely true. The people putting out these numbers never once looked into sales of other vape products.

aVI upgraded, but my flavor downgraded\u000a\u000aI\u2019ll start with a brief overview to set the scene. I started vaping with a JUUL just to see if I liked it. I did, and so I bought some Blue Dot Vapor ejuice so that I could get some variety in life. That worked out well, so I moved on to the Sourin Vagon. That was fine, and the taste with both vapes was good, but I wanted to get an actual mod.\u000a\u000aThis week my Lost Vape Mirage, Samsung 40Ts, and Horizontech Falcon arrived (I\u2019ve tried to be as informed with my purschses as possible and have chosen all my supplies based off of reviews on this sub). I charged my batteries to full using a Xtar VC4. I decided to go with Convicted Mellons for my first fill of the tank since it has been one of the most mutally agreeable flavors for me and my SO. I primed the Falcon tank based off of any instruction on priming the tank that I could find. I screwed the tank into the Mirage and it read 0.16 ohm, even though the cool is 0.15 ohm. I adjusted this in the atomizer menu so that it was correct.\u000a\u000aI tried hits at 10 - 50 watts at each of the 5 watt increments and every hit tastes like I\u2019m vaping lavender hand soap. I\u2019m getting very strong floral and chemical notes, with zero fruit. It is extremely unpleasant. I had my SO try it and she hated it. The chemical/floral taste burns/tingles your throat of you take a big hit.\u000a\u000aI don\u2019t understand what is happening, and could really use some help. This particular batch of Convicted Mellons was born 11/2 and has been used for several fills in a JUUL and Sourin Vagon since. Why is it tasting so bad in the Mirage? I must be doing something wrong.
p1511
aVIt could be your pg/vg ratio, 50/50 is good for the juul but not a falcon. Could also be the nic level of the liquid, which you definitely want to step down for a sub ohm tank like the falcon. I use 3 mg. 
p1512
aVYeah, I\u2019ve been letting the bottle steep since 11/5 or so. It\u2019s been tasting great in my low power vapes (JUUL and Sourin Vagon)
p1513
aVThis happened to the wife a year or so ago.  Then I got her a Juul.  I know they're not widely highly regarded in this sub, but for quitting/killing the fix for analogs, they cannot be beat.  Afterwards, you can get you some 50mg nic salt refills. $20 will last you a month. Best of luck bro, you got this!

aVPizza Dave Delivers - A Juul Pod Review? - Sylo Refillable Pods for Juul\u000a\u000a  \u000a\u000aHello everyone, Pizza Dave here, delivering you a review of the Sylo refillable pods for Juul and other small pod systems. I don\u2019t normally review stuff like this and it doesn\u2019t really fit in with this sub. Considering many pop in here looking for Juul replacements, I feel it fits the bill. Also, with all the news about Juul pods and the flavored pods being taken away from convenience stores and gas stations in the US I felt more than ever there is a home for this product. The folks over at Bombies reached out to me to review the Sylo refillable pods, so I decided to give them a shot.

Basically, I got these pods, I went out and bout a Juul and some mint pods, and then did some comparisons. First off, I found out why the Juuls are a popular device. The flavor from their pods is quite good, and it lasts all day long. Sure, I found that other pod systems out there outperform it, but I can see the appeal of a Juul. \u000a\u000a\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a**REFILLING**\u000a\u000aThe first thing you\u2019ll have to do is fill the pod up. It comes with two small plugs on the base of the pod. I removed both plugs to allow air to escape during refill and never had an issue with refills via plastic tipped bottles. Dropper bottles would be a bit difficult as the holes are not large. Only other con other than size is the plugs. They are small and come completely off during refill so there is a chance of losing them if not careful.\u000a\u000a\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a**FLAVOR**\u000a\u000aThis is where these pods accel. I used multiple liquids in these and every time, the flavor was on point. Vapor and flavor weren\u2019t as bountiful as with some of my favorite pod systems, but it is quite acceptable for maintaining the small form factor of a Juul. I refilled the pods countless times. I want to say I did them at least 6 or 7 times on a couple of the pods and it still tastes fine. To put that in perspective, a typical Juul user would use one pod per day at $5 per pod. These cost $4 per pod, and you will put in pennies worth of e-liquid each time. There is a huge cost savings to be had with these.\u000a\u000aSIDE NOTE FOR CURRENT JUUL USERS: 25 and 35mg nic salt liquid is very weak with these pods when compared to the throat hit of a Juul pod. I went to a 50mg and it was perfect, as this matches the nic content of a Juul.\u000a\u000a\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a**FINAL THOUGHTS**\u000a\u000aI know Juul has a bit of a shamed name these days. Many, myself included, feel that Juul has caused quite a ruckus in the vape world with their stance on flavors and caving to the FDA. However, there is no denying that they made a popular product that makes them a boatload of money. One of the biggest reasons their company has made so much is the cost of Juul pods. The Sylo pods are a huge cost savings while still providing a satisfying vape experience for Juul users.

I use the same e liquid in tanks or rdas throughout all my reviews to ensure that I am comparing apples to apples between all modern equipment. I do not post reviews until I feel confident that I have used it enough to give an educated review. The reason I started doing reviews was due to poor purchasing decisions in my vaping infancy about two years ago. Back then, I purchased several different pieces of hardware without really enjoying it and I hope my reviews can guide people into spending their hard-earned money more wisely than I did! \u005c*\u005c*\u005c*\u005c*Keep in mind that some items I receive may be pre-release and not in retail packaging. Quality may be less than the finished product and what is in the package may differ from the retail package as well.

aVTo be honest..... I'd get more if left in the oven I would say the same as I do with all pods...   let them melt...   by Friday a cool new pod system is out there...    however.....if I was a juul only user...   these are the only way to go.

aVWeird, I got some. I take a hit and it leaves the Juul firing so I'd have to pop the pod and reinsert it and the damn thing LEAKS. EVERYWHERE.

aV(startup) Juul Compatible Engraved Shells\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000aHi Fellow Juulers!\u000a\u000aAbout Two weeks ago I posted on this thread that I was preparing to launch a Juul Engraving Startup\u000a\u000aThere were lots of positive reactions from you guys so I'm posting again to update that finally we are Live!\u000a\u000aWe want to approach the customizing market in a radically different way by providing Pre-Engraved/Custom Engraved Juul shells. Yes, the Shell not the Whole Device :)\u000a\u000aThat way there is no hassle of sending the whole device back and forth between every engraving.We all occasionally might have seen Juul Wraps and Cases but I believe the best solution for customizing a Juul is through laser engraving. Durable, non-fading and finally no more of that sticky residue! Engravings are permanent and will never fade away. You can even feel the texture!\u000a\u000a[https://imgur.com/GbhCoOK](https://imgur.com/GbhCoOK)\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a*Processing gif 80aztcwj07121...*\u000a\u000a*Processing img sa6tunti07121...*\u000a\u000aI got lots of design ideas and help fellow redditers as well as friends and I would like to thank you all for the warm welcome and support.\u000a\u000aTo pay back the support, I decided to lower the price of all products for the next one month.\u000a\u000acode: engrazeit\u000a\u000aWe picked only the premium materials for the products and paid lots of attention to not the product but packaging as well as website.\u000a\u000aWe also Do custom engravings, shoot me an PM for a quote.\u000a\u000aEnjoy :) -\u000a\u000a**DISCLAIMER:** Our products and designs are not Affiliated, Related nor licensed by JUUL.

aVWant to buy a Mod\u000a\u000aI quit smoking with the help of the Juul, but lately the Juul has not been very satisfying. The battery has been dying rather quick and I feel like the pods don\u2019t last as long and the drags are very weak. As of now I am debating between the Innokin Proton 235w and the Vaporesso Armour Pro 100w. I have also considered the Aegis Legend since I do work construction and it seems durable. I\u2019m also down for any other suggestions!

aVHow to quit "nicotine salts" as a college student with a stressful workload?\u000a\u000aReason for saying "nicotine salts" is because that is what I have first started smoking. I've had the juul, sourin, breeze, you name it and it is time to stop. After being around people who have them, I had to get one myself. I love the morning hit and any hits after that. But my wallet does not love it. I am sick of the chemical taste that these juices give me and the constant spitting in my mouth.  I am prescribed adderall and adderall and nicotine are like best friends together, which is not helping. I am thinking about quitting cold turkey this weekend, but am scared of the side effects. I have finals in 2 weeks. Will I be shaky? Will I not focus on school work? Should I wait till after finals? Will all I think about is nicotine when I'm studying? If anyone has any information or experiences please let me know!

aVFoment [review] - a refillable Juul pod replacement, Sylo Pods!\u000a\u000aWhat's up today folks? Today I've got for you a rather specific product review, not a whole kit, but refillable pods for the Juul. These are [Sylo pods](https://sylopods.com/) /u/sylopods. The pods were sent to me by [Bombies](https://www.bombies.com/) /u/_Bombies for the purpose of this review. So, refillable pods for what may be the most ubiquitous kit on the market, are they any better than the prefilled pods? Let's discuss!\u000a\u000a#Photo Dump\u000a---------------------------------\u000a\u000a[Imgur Album](https://imgur.com/a/YjeMFkO)\u000a\u000a#Aesthetics\u000a------------------------------\u000a\u000aI've really gotta break this formula huh? Not a lot to say about the looks of a pod, right? if there were one thing to mention, there's less of the juice reservoir visible on these pods once they're connected than the standard pods. Arguably, that probably looks better but does make it a bit harder to assess your juice level without removing the pod.\u000a\u000a#Refilling\u000a----------------------------\u000a\u000aThere are two itty-bitty rubber plugs that fit in securely on the base of the pods with a smaller cut out section on each that is secured into a notch to make the plugs just a bit more secure. I don't really love that I have to remove both plugs to fill the pod with juice, but so long as the pod is very low, removing both plugs will allow the pod to push air out one while filling from the other, which can make it very quick to fill an empty pod, but given how thin the pods are, there is a propensity for air to be trapped under any remaining juice in the pod, so trying to top up a partially filled pod can be a chore.\u000a\u000a#Performance\u000a-----------------------------\u000a\u000aComparing these one to one with refillable pods like the Innokin EQ, they're *okay*. Not the most vapor produced, not the best in class for flavor among pods as a broad topic. They're fine in that sense, not amazing but far from offensively bad. When compared to the actual Juul pods that are sold prefilled: These are fantastic. The vapor production is pretty much right in line with Pax/Juul's offerings but these are able to produce a stronger flavor than the original pods without spitting or gurgling. One thing that I think cannot be stated enough here: using a good refillable pod with the juul grants you a markedly better experience with the same hardware. Just the access to juices with a modern profile alone is a worthwhile endeavor. Having gone through both Juul's "Vanilla creme" and "Cool mint" pods, the flavors in those pods are underdeveloped across the board. Both feel very actively like flavors we'd have grabbed cheaply back in the CE4 days. Generic, single note, and not true to their descriptions. Using near anything from a respectable vendor at this point is a huge upgrade. I have said it several times, and I'll likely keep harping on it, In my experience MTL does better with simpler flavors, but that doesn't mean that they have to be boring or underdeveloped. The Sylo pods allow you to use your own juice, from just about any vendor, salt or otherwise. The Sylo pods are more than capable of keeping up with 50/50 and 60/40 juice without any threat of dry hits, which certainly should be the case, but bears noting as not every pod is created equally. I've experienced generally good pod life out of these, having gone through two different pods with different juices and have gotten through 4 full pods in each without feeling I need to change them out. That said some juices with sweetener or richer tobacco profiles would likely decrease the pod life.\u000a\u000a**Pros:**  \u000a* Relatively easy to fill   \u000a* Equal or better than prefilled pods for flavor   \u000a* Solid 4+ fill pod life   \u000a\u000a**Cons:**   \u000a* Can't really top up the pods   \u000a* Rubber plugs are relatively easy to lose  \u000a\u000a#Final Thoughts\u000a----------------------------------\u000a\u000aThe Sylo pods are a solid pick up for folks already using the Juul. I don't know that I'd use them as the sole justification for buying a Juul myself but there's something to be said for the ubiquity of the format. If you're out for the day and run out of juice you can be reasonably well assured that you'll be able to track down some Juul pods even if there isn't a vape shop nearby (Though I suppose that may be changing).\u000a\u000a#Thanks for reading!

aVThe Breeze and Breeze 2 are a bit higher output than most - they're about 16w compared to somewhere round 7w for the likes of the Juul, so I'd be looking at those. Nautilus AIO runs off OG Nauti coils - they'll do 70 if you live in a warm climate - I could get away with 70 on them when I lived in Miami. 
p1525
aVPod wise not really, imo pod systems are 2012 tech wrapped in 2018 hype, id recomend a small mod and tank such as a pico kit or armour pro kit over a pod system. The only pod system that consistently worked for me was the juul but that seems like its got way way too much nicotine for what your after

aVHow do you handle Vape Bans?\u000a\u000aHello all. I've been smoke free for almost 3 months now and all this while, I've managed to stay off cigarettes (used to do half a pack a day). In the last 3 months I've moved from JUUL to an Aspire K3 to a Tarot Nano, and I'm very pleased with the result. \u000a\u000aNow, I travel a ton for work (once or twice a week) and so far, I've been lucky to travel to places where vaping is ok even if not quite legal (the US, India, Dubai, Europe). The trouble is I have a few trips coming up to Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia in the next few weeks. The chap at my local vape store was telling me how he was in jail for a month in Thailand as he got caught vaping on a beach and refused to bribe a cop. \u000a\u000aI want to make sure I don't run afoul of the law in any of these places so what do you chaps do to avoid vaping bans? I'd hate to go back to stinkies. \u000a\u000aThanks in advance.

aVMy boyfriend and I haven\u2019t smoked any cigarettes in 7 days because of Juul. We\u2019ve both smoked for about 25 years each.\u000a\u000aI like the size and convenience of the Juul. A lot of other products seem large, awkward, and complicated like starting a hobby. \u000a\u000aI bought us each a Juul starter kit with 4 different flavors. I like that the flavors are discrete compared to the sickeningly sweet stuff I smell when others are vaping. \u000a\u000aIt feels enough like smoking that we\u2019ve had no issues. We even went out for drinks and enjoyed our Juul on the smoking patio with no problem. The bar even sells the cigarettes we\u2019ve always smoked and we were fine. \u000a\u000aI enjoy getting some nicotine and not smelling like shit from smoking. By day 3 we weren\u2019t coughing in the morning. The device charges in under an hour. 4 pods have lasted me a week and I smoked 1 - 1 1/2 packs a day. I\u2019m saving about $60 a week compared to cigarettes. It\u2019s also convenient that I can buy pods at 7-11, as well as several smoke shops in my area. \u000a\u000aIn the past I\u2019ve quit a few times using nicotine gum, even for as long as 2 years, but it was always difficult. I always wanted to smoke and had cravings. While I\u2019m only a week in, this is the easiest thing I\u2019ve ever done. And I can see quitting Juul eventually. My habits are changing and I\u2019m already not as attached to it as I was cigarettes. This feels and smells so much cleaner, I doubt I could ever enjoy a cigarette again.\u000a\u000aWhen you light a cigarette, you commit to smoking the whole thing. With Juul, I take a few puffs and put it back in my pocket and I\u2019m good.\u000a\u000aFor the low cost and ease of use, I highly recommend it. I wish I\u2019d done it sooner. I wish these existed 30 years ago when my grandparents tried to quit smoking.

aVNeed help with 3rd party juul pods, JX01 refillable cartridges not hitting\u000a\u000aWanted to save money and get refillable cartridges but they don't work well. i get about 20-30 good puffs off of them and then it wont hit at all, a tiny little puff comes out if i pull really hard. i used 3 cartridges in a row and they all did this. i just started vaping and don't know a lot about how the pods are constructed, is there an easy fix for something like this? i think the tube is getting clogged. sometimes sticking a paper clip down there helps, sometimes it doesn't. not sure if that's the culprit.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000ai tried it in a juul and an eonsmoke ivape, same issue. this is the longest i've gone without cigarettes in 15 years and it would be awesome if i could use this system so i dont just have a worthless juul lying around.

The shape of the pods fit the lips better than any other pod I have tried. Refilling these pods works well. It has a check valve style port, so all you need to do is push the tip of the bottle in, squeeze the bottle, and voila, it\u2019s filled. This is not great for those who use dropper bottles, but thankfully Renovo thought ahead and included a small refill bottle. The pods are held in place via magnets. They stay snuck in place but can be pulled off if you attempt to pull the device out of your pocket by the pod.\u000a\u000a\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u005c_\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a**HOW IT VAPES / FINAL THOUGHTS**\u000a\u000aNow that you know how to run it and how to fill it, it\u2019s time to vape it. Overall, the vape from this is just as good as any pod I have tried out there. The draw is middle of the road when it comes to restriction. It is a nice medium draw mouth to lung. I did some side by side testing with other devices and found the draw to be very close to that of a Juul. The Innokin EQ and Joyetech Runabout were both looser than this. Now for flavor. It provides an excellent vape. The flavor production is right up there with the Innokin EQ and Joyetech Runabout, which up and until now were the reigning champs for flavor in my opinion. I didn\u2019t notice a massive difference in the power modes. It\u2019s a small difference between the modes, but it is noticeable if you really really really try to differentiate. Doing a blind test, I could tell the difference between red and green, but not blue to red or green. I ended up leaving it on blue all the time as I felt a middle range was about right and thought it could extend battery life and coil life. The only gripe that I have with this kit was that I only had one pod to test with. There were moments where it flooded and gurgled, but then it would clear out and be fine again for 100 puffs. When it was flooded it also struggled to fire unless I really puffed hard on it. Keep in mind also that the temperature I was running this at was about 10 degrees F, which always thickens up e-liquid. Pod life seems to be on part with most companies. I started to taste it going bad around 8 refills. I am still running it on refill 13, and I don\u2019t see myself chucking it just yet. Battery life on this is surprisingly good for the size. The 650mah battery had no issues getting through the day and could easily get me partially into the next day if I wanted to, but I tossed it on the charger at the end of my day anyway. Coincidentally the pod was nearly empty at about the battery was depleted.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aAs for final thoughts, the Zero is right at the number 2 slot in my favorite pod systems tested this year. The Innokin EQ is still ranked #1 based on flavor and lack of issues with the pods. Battery life is good, flavor is good, and it\u2019s quite affordable.  With issues aside, I can definitely recommend this device for anyone looking for a pod system.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a**THE OVEN TEST**\u000a\u000aIf this one accidentally went into the pizza oven, would I go out and buy another?

I use the same e liquid in tanks or rdas throughout all my reviews to ensure that I am comparing apples to apples between all modern equipment. I do not post reviews until I feel confident that I have used it enough to give an educated review. The reason I started doing reviews was due to poor purchasing decisions in my vaping infancy about two years ago. Back then, I purchased several different pieces of hardware without really enjoying it and I hope my reviews can guide people into spending their hard-earned money more wisely than I did! \u005c*\u005c*\u005c*\u005c*Keep in mind that some items I receive may be pre-release and not in retail packaging. Quality may be less than the finished product and what is in the package may differ from the retail package as well.

aVYes.  Juul is like 59mg.  
p1533
aVI'll be honest. I started vaping about a month ago. I tried a gas station cig alike - Totallywicked Switz2 Basic for a couple of days and it wasn't effective as a replacement for Cigarettes even with 18 mg/ml juice. Then a friend lent me a Juul for a day (approximately 1 pod). It was much better and I learned a little about nicotine salts. I went to buy my own Juul device at a local B&amp;M. They were out of stock but offered me a Breeze 2. I bought it. I tried it and I liked it better than the Juul. I used it for about 4 or 5 days and my brother decided to follow my example and try vaping. He borrowed the Breeze 2 I had and didn't want to return it. (He gave me an old 3 battery Mod he had received as a gift and an Aspire Revvo Tank but there turned out to be a problem with the mod or the batteries and it didn't get much use). So I went to purchase a replacement for the Breeze 2. The B&amp;M didn't have any Breeze 2 in stock any more so the attendant suggested Breeze 1 or Nautilus. I went with Breeze 1. I used it for a day or so, wasn't happy and returned it for a Nautilus AIO. I used that for about a week. It wasn't as good as the Breeze 2 but better than the Breeze 1. The flavour was muted. Nicotine didn't feel as punchy. I ended up returning that too and in the meantime the B&amp;M had gotten new stock including a Breeze 2. This time I got an iridescent crimson version that I absolutely love and have been using for about a week.\u000a\u000aSo all I can say with certainty is at least a week to a coil. I really haven't had the opportunity to try the same set of gear longer. But the coil seems to still be working on my original Breeze for my brother but he isn't vaping as regularly as I am.

aVSmok Infinix - Failing after a month\u000a\u000aHey all, relatively new to vapes. I had a Juul for a while and purchased an Infinix so I could use my own liquids. It was a beast for the first month. I ended up running the 2 pods it came with dry and burning the wicks.\u000a\u000aI purchased a set of new pods and that\u2019s when the issues started. All 3 pods leaked and would spit up. Eventually it would always fire the whole 8 seconds and time out. I read a lot of good and bad about the Infinix but it I am one of the ones who got a failing device and I can\u2019t stay committed to something that is so unreliable, especially when all 3 new pods were duds.\u000a\u000aI ended up getting a Vaporesso Armour Pro which has been great, but I like the discreetness of the pod systems while at work. I\u2019ll be receiving a Vladdin RE today and hopefully it works better than the Infinix.\u000a\u000aAnyway, I just wanted to share my experience with the Infinix. It was great when it worked but unreliable shortly after.

aVJUUL CRISIS HELP\u000a\u000ajuul crisis ik... shoot me but my juul charger is lost and i keep messing up the diy charger you can make with a phone charger. any other ways to charge a juul without the charger and without a phone charger?
p1536
aVI would suggest getting another juul. Back up device plus new charger. 
p1537
aVim 17 and my mom hates juuls so its hard
p1538
aVRelationship between mg and Ohms between devices\u000a\u000aI am going from a juul to a 1.5 ohm pod device (justfog minifit). What level nic salt juice will give me the same hit? My other device i use is around .2 resistance at 35w and 1.5-3 mg (goliath v2).\u000a\u000a24 mg salts seem to be in the middle but i know the juul is 5% but kinda a weak device. \u000a\u000aOr is there a chart or anything that can show me a comparison between strength of device, strength of juice and the hit ill get from it?
p1539
aVDTL to MTL nicotine strength\u000a\u000aHey guys, I'm thinking about picking up an MTL atty to try out since I've exclusively vaped DTL since I started. I've had some experience with my friends pod systems (juul and Sourin drop) and I enjoyed the tight draw and high nicotine. For anyone who's made a similar transition, how much did you raise your nicotine levels? I DTL 3mg freebase or 6mg nic salts. I'm thinking of jumping to 12mg Salts but I don't know if that will have the same throat hit as those pod devices. 
p1540
aVI\u2019m going to be buying an aspire breeze 2. I\u2019ve been vaping on a Juul, what mg of nic salt juice is equal to %5.0 that the Juul pods come in.\u000a\u000a
p1541
aVI\u2019ve never used a Juul but I run the Breeze2 with 24mg salts on the 0.6ohm coil and it\u2019s solid. 
p1542
aVI used a juul at their 5mg and switched to a breeze 2 using 35mg. I found that the 50mg at the breeze 2 gave me a huge headache and I'm pretty satisfied with 35mg. 
p1543
aVYou don't want the same strength as the Juul. The Breeze 2 makes much bigger clouds than the Juul; the bigger the cloud, the more nicotine *in* the cloud  and thus the more nicotine you get per drag. The highest you want with the 1.0ohm coil is 35mg and for the 0.6ohm you want no more than 20mg, but if you can find nic salts between 12-18 somewhere that could suit it a little better. I have the Breeze 1 and the 0.6ohm coils make pretty decent sized clouds.
p1544
aVSuggestions for Juul alternatives?\u000a\u000aHeyo,\u000aSlightly new to ecigs and vaping. Quit smoking squares a few months ago and bought a juul on a whim to help out. I know nothing about vaping and the easier the better. \u000aJuul has worked incredibly for me personally, but now I\u2019m facing the issue of how much nicotine is in a pod. I want to cut back on nicotine and that just physically isn\u2019t possible with the Juul. Curious about any other recommendations going about this issue and where to start?\u000a\u000aAppreciate it
p1545
aVHow exactly can we use nic salt juice?\u000a\u000aI'll feel thankfully educated after I get the answers but I'll also look back and maybe feel dumb for asking (though obviously ppl don't know until they ask). \u000a\u000aSo with nic salt juice, is it able to be used with normal mods and normal tanks with normal coils ? Like I have a big baby beast and use the 0.04 to 0.15 ohm coils. Can nic juice be used with my normal juice set up? I know juul pod things exist but I'm loathe to spend more $ when I may already be set up.... \u000a\u000aIf I can use my BBB tank, is there then a certain coil for nic salt juice for my tank ?\u000a\u000a

aVI have tried Juul, Breeze, Breeze 2 and Nautilus AIO and I prefer the Breeze 2. Breeze 1 is weaker, less flavourful and less vapour. It has a smaller battery, so need to be charged sooner.\u000a\u000aNautilus doesn't have sub ohm coils so I found the vapour weaker, nicotine and flavour more muted and it wasn't as satisfying.\u000a\u000aI have not tried the Spryte but it has less battery capacity and I think doesn't take subohm coils. Worth checking those points out if they're important to you.\u000a\u000aJuul has limited flavours, less power, proprietary battery charger and the nicotine hit less punchy. \u000a\u000aI recently started vaping and unless your best friend is a vape hobbyist with a collection of prominent devices to let you try out, you'll just have to take a leap and find your happy place with trial and error. I think the links on the sidebar are a helpful starting point, like the Anthony Vapes recommended list and reviews but between similar devices, you just have to wing it at first. 
p1548
aVWell, we didnt really pick up cigs in our youth, I got into it on my first job because it was the only proper break you got (paramedic). But sure, no hard feelings. Is there a Nicotin free version of the Juuls products?

aVHelp me choose an e-cig.\u000a\u000aHey !!\u000a\u000aI want help choosing the best e-cig that I got available for sale in my area. I could be phrasing stuff incorrectly cause I am new to this vaping/juuling stuff but I hope u get what I mean :p\u000a\u000ae-cigs I tried :-\u000a\u000a\u005c- My jet (from a friend) : Used the Grape 50MG salt nic from secret sauce and it was a horrible experience. Very little smoke and It really hurt my chest. Then I tried the Jamaica Tobbacco 35mg salt nic and it was the same experience. Maybe it was from the device itself but I am not sure, I just throwed it away.\u000a\u000a\u005c- Aspire Breeze 2 : Used the same Grape salt and It wasn't hurting my chest anymore but I was getting this harsh irritating hit in my throat and didn't get enough taste out of the juice. Then I tried the double apple nic salt 50MG from Juicy and it was a lot better but after like 2 days it looses the flavor. As of the device it self, It always had a spit back only when I refill it which was annoying, and also some coils that I bought had some issues where some gave me dry hits.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aSo the e-cigs that I can buy from my area are as follows:\u000a\u000a\u005c- Justfog C601\u000a\u000a\u005c- Justfog Minifit\u000a\u000a\u005c- Laan Lite Pod\u000a\u000a\u005c- Mi-Pod\u000a\u000a\u005c- Myle\u000a\u000a\u005c- Pulse Ply rock\u000a\u000a\u005c- S-pod kit\u000a\u000a\u005c- SMOANT S8 Pod\u000a\u000a\u005c- Smok Infinix\u000a\u000a\u005c- Smok Novo\u000a\u000a\u005c- Valaddin\u000a\u000a\u005c- Vapperesso Aurora \u000a\u000a\u005c- Vapperesso Rolo\u000a\u000a\u005c- Vaperesso Zero\u000a\u000a\u005c- Y7 pods\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aWhat I am looking for is a device that gives out the best flavor from the salt.

aVTBD Liquids: The Best Black Friday Sale &amp; [Giveaway] | Limited Time Candy Cane Flavor + Tons Of Free Extras\u000a\u000aHey all!\u000a\u000aIt's that time of year again, it's savings &amp; giveaway season! This time of year always reminds me of our humble beginnings here at ECR. It was around this time four years ago that I started TBD, giving away free samples to members of ECR to help make my recipes better. \u000a\u000aOur first black friday sale four years ago, I was visiting with my family out of town and couldn't believe the amount of orders that were coming in. I couldn't put my phone down! I ended up driving through the night to get back to work right away because at that time it was just me handling the orders, and I definitely wasn't expecting that much traffic. I think it took nearly 3 weeks of working 12 hour days to get through all the black friday orders, I listened to a LOT of audiobooks during that first year lol. TBD has definitely grown a lot since then, and it's all been thanks to you guys and your support over the years. \u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a###Coming Soon: Nicotine Salts\u000a***\u000aWe have an announcement to make, as I know a lot of you have been asking us about when we'll be making our flavors available with salt-based nicotine. We plan to start with a small number of flavors that we've tested on a number of devices geared towards vaping nicotine salts such as the Drop/Breeze/Juul (w/ sylo pods) etc. \u000a\u000a**We've taken a long time getting these ready as we wanted to make sure our flavors not only tasted well but performed well in these devices. One of the things we're striving for with our salt-nicotine flavors is longevity, as we feel that a lot of the nic salt juices available out there right now burn pods out too quickly**. We don't want you having to change out your pods every refill or two, we want them to burn clean enough that you can get a few extra fills in there before you need to swap them out. \u000a\u000aThat being said, **we plan to have our first introduction of nicotine salt flavors available for purchase during our upcoming Christmas Sale at the end of next month**. \u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a###Black Friday 40% Off Sale\u000a***\u000a\u000aOur Black Friday Sale is now live! \u000a\u000a* **40% Off All E-Liquid/Accessories** \u000a* **Random Bottle Size Upgrades on EVERY order**  \u000a^If ^you ^order ^a ^30ml ^you ^might ^end ^up ^with ^50ml ^etc.\u000a* **Every 50th &amp; 100th Order will win extra goodies**  \u000a^Gift ^Cards, ^Extra ^Juice, ^Doubled ^Juice, ^etc.  \u000a\u000a**Our Special Holiday Candy Cane Flavor is BACK and now Available for a Limited Time.** \u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;**Use Code: BLACKFRIDAY**\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; www.tbdliquids.com\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a###Giveaway\u000a***\u000aWithout further ado, here's the giveaway just for ECR - \u000a\u000a**How To Enter:**\u000a&gt; Post a reply to this thread letting us know which flavor you most enjoy from us or which flavor you're most interested in trying\u000a\u000a**What's Up For Grabs:**\u000a&gt; 5 Lucky People will Win a $50 Gift Card\u000a\u000a&gt; 10 Lucky People will Win a $25 Gift Card\u000a\u000aWe'll post a separate thread on Sunday announcing/tagging the winners and we'll edit this post with the link to that thread. \u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a***\u000aThank you all again for your love &amp; support, you've made this another successful year for TBD!

aVFear mongering at its best here.\u000a\u000aSo I was tagged on Facebook today reg and regarding this post.  I didnt really know what to say to the girl other than the facts used are the same rehashed garbage we've seen for years now.  \u000a\u000aIt pissed me off starting my day out being tagged in this.\u000a\u000ahttps://draxe.com/juuling/\u000a\u000a

aVYeah, a bit exaggerated, to say the least. I'm not a fan of Juul, or any of the nic salt pod devices. But, this is a bit much.

aVThis is the best Nic salt pod system in 2018\u000a\u000aI was struggling to find the best pod system in the market because I just simply want to make my workdays less painful, and I've tried Juul, Phix, Breeze 2, SMOK NOVO, Lost Vape Orion and finally, ZQ came up and man this is what I really want, deeply from my heart :'( But surprisingly, i found that almost no one is talking about this system. \u000a\u000aAll the pod systems have annoying cons: breeze 2's drip tip is literately the pain in my ass and the its coil has no quality control at all, only 1 out of 3 can actually work! Lost Vape Orion's pods are unbelievably overpriced and not suitable for Nic Salt at all. Please don't buy any pod system from SMOK and for those of you still think SMOK rocks, please just try something else. But ZQ doesn't, I can't find any con from this amazingly perfect device. God, that flavor, ZQ is the only pod system I've tried that can actually give you flavor. Breeze 2 has no flavor to serve you at all, no flavor! \u000a\u000aI live in China so I could easily get this, the device is about $20 and the pod is about $3 each. Just want to remind the guys that are still searching for the best pod system for work, you should give this a shot, and don't waste your money on Breeze 2, please. And the reviewers, before you post your best of 2018, try this, please. I just don't get it why nobody's talking about this. No, I'm not sponsored because ZQ is also designed by Aspire, and breeze 2 is a waste of money, bro.\u000a\u000a[No,  don't try Breeze 2 ](https://i.redd.it/b5picgan79021.jpg)

aVJUUL vs. Vuse Alto\u000a\u000aHave any JUUL users tried the Vuse Alto? From what I hear it's very similar, and a bit cheaper than JUUL. I don't like the idea of funding R.J. Reynolds, but JUUL is way over priced and I still really need the convenience of being able to get my nicotine from any gas station store.

aVLook up the boulder rock. It's probably the best e cig besides the juul. Got a loose draw though

aVClean nic salt juice for a pod device?\u000a\u000aMy go to has been placid from Adirondack for my crown 3, coils last anywhere from 3 weeks to a month with heavy vaping (10-15ml a day). Purchased a Renova zero after rotating in a juul which reviews have said should go through 5-6 refills and the flavor got muted after 3. I\u2019ve searched and haven\u2019t found anything, but can anyone recommend a line that won\u2019t kill the coils quickly? Thanks in advance!

aVJuul vs Novo\u000a\u000aNeed a new e cig. Have had the juul in the past and I love it, although quite expensive. I lost my juul the other day and was wondering if I should get another one or get the smok novo. I heard the Novo is great and cheaper than the juul. Is the throat hit better on it? Is it that much cheaper?

aVWhen to reduce nicotine levels in nic salts?\u000a\u000aI quit cigs back in August and went full on to vaping - it has worked wonders. Now, my question is, how long should I wait to reduce nic levels?\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aI'm currently using a Juul and 45mg mr salt. I have a few in 25mg, but I still find myself going for the 45. Ultimately, I'd like to get down to 25mg only.
