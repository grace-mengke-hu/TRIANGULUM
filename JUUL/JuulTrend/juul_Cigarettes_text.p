p2
aVI LOVE the juul. I've had a ton of experience with this device any questions feel free to message me. I've had at least 10 of them. I prefer the cool mint the most.
p3
aVNickTheSmoker wholeheartedly agrees.\u000a\u000aThe JUUL, hands down, is the most satisfying vaping experience for cigarette smokers or those trying to quit--lugging around a box mod with a tank is not going to cut it out in terms of physical experience.\u000a\u000aThe JUUL is physically similar to a cigarette smoking experience and the throat/nicotine hit is enough to be like a cigarette.
p4
aVI love the juul, i used it to cut my cigs to 1-2 vigs a day which makes it a treat. If you want to quit or simply cut back the juul is perfect
p5
aVPax makes an ecig called the juul that has an amazingly close tobacco flavor with a super high nicotine strength to mirror a cigarette. But they don't use liquid nicotine so it's not really harsh. They use nicotine salts
p6
aVI would look into a little ecig called the Juul. Has a good amount of nicotine and hits your throat hard unlike most vapes.
p7
aVI smoke 1 cig a day paired with my juul. Ill go a couple days without smoking any. 
p8
aVI know this is a cigarette sub, but juul's really hit the spot. You dont have to sub your cigs but just accompany it. Its stronger than any cig ive ever smoked
p9
aVFrom what I\u2019ve read about the Juul, it sounds like it might hit hard enough to replace at least the drug aspect of it (if not the ritual and pyromania). Not available in the UK though. :(\u000a\u000aVaping as a community terrifies me, though.
p10
aVThe only vape that's come close to giving me the same feeling was the juul but they're a sleazy company with poor customer service. I have a couple of nice mods that I use but again it's more about the way Tobacco o makes you feel and less about nicotine. It's just not the same. 
p11
aVtray a juul.
p12
aVI don't mean to be "that guy" on this sub, but smoking is dangerous as all hell and I don't think it helps with your happiness all that much. If you really want nicotine to calm your nerves, pick up a Juul e-cig my guy. Gives you a great buzz and you get the added perks of being able to puff on it inside and never smelling like cigs. And no proven serious health risks of course. Just my two cents.
p13
aVWhat e-cig are you using? I can use a Juul pretty much just like a cigarette, like 4 or 5 drags gives me a great feeling in the morning. As far as small cigalikes go there are very few decent ones. Btw I still smoke casually with friends who smoke, I just prefer the e-cig because smoking overall becomes a pain in the dick (to me personally, as much as I love it).
p14
aVI can't inhale from the fog machines without coughing for some reason so they're useless to me. But I've been using a Juul for about a month now because I need to stop smoking due to health reasons. The throat hit is similar to smoking so it works for me. I doubt I'll never smoke again but at least with the Juul I don't have to smoke every day. \u000a\u000aI think it could be useful for smokers who want an alternative but otherwise the giant box mods that blow massive clouds are just silly. Vaping has it's place I suppose.
p15
aVI started because most of my friends had tried it and I wanted to as well. And when you\u2019re drunk the buzz feels really good. I actually like the smell of it on my clothes lol. But it\u2019s a horrible habit so I only smoke when I drink! If you want to feel that head rush I would recommend you buy a juul, although it\u2019s another expensive habit :(
p16
aVDon't go back to smoking but if you must get a Juul. Take it easy at first because it's very strong and you haven't smoked in 5 years
p17
aVI\u2019d say you should probably look into getting a vape. The community on the electronic cigarettes subreddit is very welcoming and helpful for people who don\u2019t know anything about it. You could also just get a JUUL. It\u2019s probably not worth it to get back into the cycle when your current situation is just as temporary as when you originally quit
p18
aVGet a Juul. Problem solved.
p19
aVAbsolutely. I went to Thanksgiving dinner out of state and drove with some of my family and I was told that I would not be able to bring any cigarettes whatsoever because it would "look bad" even though I'm of legal age to purchase. It was not very good and I was puffing on my juul every 10 minutes
p20
aVSounds like your taste buds are shot. You could try sticking to the juul for a week and see if your sense of taste comes back.
p21
aVI can't taste my cigarettes or Juul anymore?
p22
aVLooked at lots of different packs and decided on this one for my first. Not planning to smoke a ton, maybe once a week or month, hence the juul in the background. \u000a\u000aJust the pods + pack was $43.76 where I was. 
p23
aVYeah, I've been battling with depression, and have been using juul for awhile now, so cigs will just be a treat for me. Juul will be for everyday use. 
p24
aVYeah, I'm well aware with the journey I've had with my juul. \u000a\u000a\u000aBest of luck with you 
p25
aVI'm a little bitch and a juul gives me really hard throat hits, so I'm gonna start off light and see how I like it 
p26
aVWhat's a Juul?
p27
aVTry the juul, you might like it
p28
aVIf you are still here try th Juul and never judge it before trying it for a week \U0001f642
p29
aVAround two weeks . I use 6mg nic on a box mod and its great. You can look into higher nic lower wattage devices like the Juul. They use  50mg salt nic and a low power. Devices like the Juul and Phix are most similar to actual cigs in terms of nicotine. 
p30
aVI vape till I'm buzzed before bed (Juul) and after breakfast I light up\u000a\u000aSo whenever I'm asleep
p31
aVWas it after a workout or some type of physical activity? I got a buddy who'll take a rip of their JUUL and do jumping jacks right after to get a buzz.
p32
aVJUUL Mango - Pod Cartridge 4 Pack Refills for JUUL Pod Vape
p33
aVImo in the long run it won't make much a difference which cigarette you smoke, just how much you smoke. Maybe a Juul, but that's not really smoking.
p34
aVMy best advice, \u000a1. get her a Juul, Vaping is not for everybody but the Juul is so sleek, convenient, and not super obnoxious clouds. Also when i quit it was only thing that gave me a throat hit and similar buzz to a cig.\u000a\u000a2. The more times you try to quit the harder it is, so if she's thinking about quitting i know it might be hard to say, but if she's not confident she can do it, then might be better to tell her to wait until she's certain she wont fail\u000a\u000aA  nice middle point of these two is maybe get the Juul, and Juul and also smoke cigs while she slowly leans off cigs and more towards Juul, then after a little she might find it easier to be confident and commit to actually quitting the ciggys.
p35
aVThank you!  I\u2019ll check into the Juul.  That\u2019s a great tip.
p36
aVGet her a juul as others said. I'm sure it will work
p37
aVyou should try a juul. its definitely no cigarette but if you're someone who has never used one before it can definitely hit the throat hard.
p38
aVThat's your problem bud. If your looking to make a healthier choice while remaining to intake nicotine I would have to say a vape is your best option. You could still keep a pack of cigs and smoke a cig every now and then but nothing will really replace a cigarette. Vapes such as the juul come very close but never quite the same
p39
aVThere really is 50mg vape juice. Look at Mr salt-e or Level up Vapor. They create highly concentrated nicotine salt juices for low power devices and work surprisingly well. I used them in my juul which is already at around 55mg.
p40
aVI love buzzes honestly. I don't get them frequently or intensely, but when I do it makes my morning. I actually hit a Juul for the first time the other day, and the buzz made me really consider buying one, but I just love cigarettes too much. 
p41
aVI don't really smoke much but I hit the JUUL a few times through out the day and its great, wake up and take a big hit, perfect way to wake up
p42
aVYou should try vaping. I know what you're thinking, but there's this little device called the juul and its small, cheap, convenient, and the closest thing I have ever seen come close to a cigarette.
p43
aVHow many hits did you take off the juul? 2 or 3 4 second d hits off a juul is comparable to one cigarette for me
p44
aVI smoked the juul before even really smoking cigs that much.  I hit it all night long and hardly felt a buzz.  Is there a certain way to inhale it compared to cigarettes?
p45
aVLol sure they will.. gotta quit if you want real symptom relief, look into buying a juul
p46
aVTry snus or get a JUUL
p47
aVTry juul. One little pod of that shit has the nic equivalent of 1 pack of smokes.
p48
aVGet a juul, you van stealth hit those anywhere. Ive hit it everyplace imaginable. In a restaraunt, in lecture, and basically every "smoke free" area
p49
aVIf you want the feeling of smoking, but without all the secondhand smoke and what not, try the Juul. It's the next best thing. I know you might be thinking that e-cigs cant compare (which they can't) but this one comes pretty damn close without all the stink and stain of analogs. I use it when I'm aching for a camel but i can't light up then and there. \u000a\u000aBut good luck on your quitting journey.\u000a\u000a
p50
aVAs a teenager I'm not a jock at all I got wrapped up in a bad crowd and it was my fault but I don't see myself as an asshole. I'm a skinny tall guy who used to be a giant video game nerd now I've turned to listening to chill music and am sort of a loner just trying to survive High School. So yeah the anti smoking ads are wrong. Their are some asshole jocks who Dip and Vape from stuff like the Juul but that's it. 
p51
aVDont think of it quite like that. I began supplementing my cigarettes with a juul. And overtime i started smoking less and less as i could use the juul indoors, or when it was raining outside etc. Eventually one day i finished a pack and never had the urge to buy another and know im cig free. I still smoke around 1 or 2 cigs a month for those fucked up nights but asside that i just stopped
p52
aVHave you tried an e-cig like the Juul? It's conveniently small, easy to use, and packs a much heavier drag than any other e-cigs I've tried. Flavor pods are kinda pricey and limited in flavors but it's the closest I ever found to taking a drag from an actual cigarette. I think there are some other similar ones to the Juul as well.
p53
aVThere's also the e-leaf icare, those are sooo nice like the Juul but are only 13 bucks online. You can also fill it with your own juice. V nice device. 
p54
aVJuul has worked with 3 of my smoking friends. Its a miracle 
p55
aVJuul is much better than an njoy, theyr kind of rare but very good
p56
aVI don't smoke Parliaments but i'll raise my rollie to your JUUL my dood, congrats on qutting!
p57
aVIn the Juul boat and still love the sub as well, quit due to bp/hr interfering with ADHD prescription. Still indulge in a smoke every now and then, but the juul does the trick alright. 
p58
aVHolding a juul like a cigar, ah I see your a man of culture as well!
p59
aVTry a Juul, sometimes it's what I want.
p60
aVI quit almost a year ago with Juul. (I cave every once and while and have a cig) They have tobacco and menthol flavors that are quite good imo. It might be more expensive that your smoking habit though depending on where you live or how much you smoke. For me it's a little bit cheaper than smoking but not by much.
p61
aVI second the Juul suggestion. I had an old Blu e-cig for awhile too but the Juul is way better. It has a great throat hit, and if you\u2019re disciplined about using it only when you really crave nicotine, it doesn\u2019t have to get too expensive. \u000a\u000aOnly word of warning is to be careful not to lose it. It\u2019s so small, thin, and lightweight that i swear you BLINK and it\u2019s gone. It loves to fall between the cracks of couches, car seats, everywhere. And most of them are a dark gray color which seems to blend into everything. \u000a\u000aI lost mine within the first month of using it, and I looked EVERYWHERE. For hours. \u000a\u000aOtherwise, it\u2019s great. Can\u2019t recommend enough. 
p62
aVhttps://www.elementvape.com/geek-vape-nova-200w-tc-starter-kit?enter=true\u000a\u000a\u000a^^^my roommate quit with this.  It hits hard with a 6mg nic, but not in an  unpleasant way.   The pic doesn't do it justice, very classy looking set up. Having a mod for at home and a salt nic vape (juul, suorin, etc.) for when on the go, you'll have the best odds of quitting 
p63
aVI do recommend vaping, but I don't think juuls are worth the money, they have poor battery life and are leak prone and their pods are really expensive compared to buying bulk eliquid. I got a vape pen for $20, works great, and it fits in my pocket no problem, I mix my own eliquid for something like $30/liter (iirc a 4 pack of juul pods is like $10) \u000a\u000aI still have a cig or cigar every now and then when I'm hanging out and drinking, but it's definitely helped me manage withdrawals 
p64
aVThere are cheaper pod systems than the juul, I just ordered a kilo system with some menthol tobacco pods. The unit itself is 20 bucks, and you get 4 pods that are larger than juul's for 20. I have the blu pod system right now, but the regular line is disgusting, and the intense line is lacking in flavors, but much more satisfying. \u000a\u000a[https://www.kiloeliquids.com/](https://www.kiloeliquids.com/)\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;
p65
aVI\u2019ve drastically cut back using the Juul. I like the crème brûlée best it reminds me of a nice pipe smoke aroma. But I still smoke, only now being used to my Juul most cigs don\u2019t taste good to me anymore, except for high quality brands like Nat Sherman\u2019s and such.
p66
aVSame here. I sometimes think more the reason I continue to smoke at this point is that in a way, it is a secret fuck you back to those who annoyingly nag me about this habit. Also, I ABSOLUTELY SO VERY MUCH love the company of other smokers, plus the ritual of smoking.\u000a\u000aI still very much believe one day I'll finally cross that bridge and do so, but I'm not ready to do so just yet. The only small step I may do sometime in the future, is to switch over to vaping. I tried doing that in the past, but looking back at that one failed attempt earlier in the 2010s, I shouldn't have only done a basic cheap vape and had fully gone for a tank style one. This was a little bit before Juul came out, btw to anyone who may ask.
p67
aVJUUL NO LONGER ABLE TO SELL FRUIT FLAVORS!?! FDA BAN!!!
p68
aVDoubt it will because menthol juul pods are exempt from the flavor ban. 
p69
aVA drawer full of cigarettes, Juul pods, and a few wax carts isn\u2019t really in the realm of \u201csubstance abuse\u201d. \u000a\u000aThat\u2019s not gatekeeping that\u2019s pointing out a fact.  
p70
aVBro I love my cigs but the JUUL is the only vape that worked for me and they wanna ban it? Wtf
p71
aVfuck JUUL, open pod systems are where it\u2019s at. get yourself an Infinix or a Vladdin, thank me later. nic salts are awesome
p72
aVI havent really heard many good reviews about the vladdin. I want to try it out I like the design and refillable pod system. how's it compare with the juul in terms of throat hit and flavor 
p73
aVcomparable or better in virtually any aspect in which you might compare it to JUUL, but that\u2019s the LEAST of it\u2019s advantages. the best thing about it is the fact that not only are you not limited to the handful of flavors that PAX chooses for you, but that you can refill a pod again and again without just throwing it out when it\u2019s empty. not to mention the superb ceramic coil technology that Vladdin uses in their RE pods...there\u2019s just so many ways in which virtually ANY open pod system beats a restrictive and overpriced closed pod system like JUUL that it\u2019s hard to say what the best part of it is.\u000a\u000ain short, i HIGHLY recommend the Vladdin RE. after i bought the starter kit (includes device, MicroUSB charging cable and one empty pod) and used it for about a week, i went and bought three more 4-packs of empty pods (which only run about $10-15 per 4-pack online) and 3-4 more various flavors of nic salts that i\u2019d been wanting to try. one of the best vape purchases i\u2019ve ever made \U0001f44d
p74
aVTobacco high feels much better than Juul high
p75
aVI notice this too. I\u2019ll hit my Juul and not feel the same euphoric relaxing buzz the Juul buzz is more of a stimulative buzz whereas tobacco is more relaxing.
p76
aVYeah, and Juul cannot emulate the taste of burning tobacco either. Cigs are way better imo. 
p77
aVGet a Juul perhaps?
p78
aVJuul mint and Camel Filters.  I'm getting a pack tonight to get used to them again :)
p79
aVWhat is everyone\u2019s opinion on Juul
p80
aVThey are ok but their are better pod products on the market now and days. Juul is just the most popular on the market because it was like the first.
p81
aVAs others have said juuls work, but they are overpriced and they also tend to leak and have bad battery lifetimes (as in toal battery charge degrades quickly over long use). I would look into other pod based vapes or starter level vape pens, you can get a better vape kit for $25 than a juul that'll last longer with better flavor options.\u000a\u000aI agree that people are stupid when they start vaping without smoking, nicotine is a bitch to quit, and vapes aren't exactly healthy either, they just aren't as bad as cigarettes. 
p82
aVJuul rocks.
p83
aVvapes aren't bad, and you won't get hounded for hitting off of one, but the buzz from actual cigarettes (imo) is a deal better. as for juuls themselves, they're okay. discrete, light, and hold a decent amount of juice that can be refilled. however the pods tend to leak, the battery life isn't fantastic, and the connotation that comes with them now(highschoolers using them in the bathrooms at school) is a turn off for some.
p84
aVJuuls are amazing if you\u2019re trying to legitimately quit. \u000a\u000aBut it\u2019s a horrible trend getting kids addicted to nicotine way too fast. I\u2019d much rather have a child smoke cigs or dips and tell me than I would have them get a juul to \u201cfit in\u201d
p85
aVIt is just the nicotine, when I smoke full flavored cigs I get insanely light headed just halfway through one. Compared to my juul I get the same thing but takes a while longer because the juul is lighter in nicotine content.
p86
aV\u201cFuck big tobacco\u201d brought to you by a corporately owned website that is probably just owned by the juul industry 
p87
aVYes get a Juul.  They whoop the nicotine straight to your mind.
p88
aVHave you considered vaping? If so try the Juul, it helped when slow down to the point where I only smoke a couple times a week
p89
aVI currently smoke a little over a pack a day.  Would be a lot more but I have a Juul that is great - a couple quick puffs and you're good as long as you stay busy.
p90
aVThey sell juuls in England?
p91
aVThe problemo is that a lot of Juul pods have horrible quality control these days.  You can usually find them super cheap in rural gas stations though. 
p92
aVThats true. It seems like half the pods i get are faulty.\u000a\u000aI got rid of my juul and bought an aspire spryte recently, liking it a lot more.
p93
aVI have asthma, and only smoke occasionally. Have coughing fits sometimes, but I\u2019ve been vaping/using my Juul more in its place. \u000a\u000aI wouldn\u2019t do it if I were you but if you don\u2019t care like myself, then go for it I guess.  
p94
aVHaha the menthol is a myth.  You will smell with any real cigarette.  Try a Juul, they don't smell at all.
p95
aVI\u2019ve used a Juul before, but I prefer cigarettes 
p96
aVeveryone should try r/Juul

p98
aVJuul tastes like dirty pussy mixed with an ashtray. \u000a\u000aNo thanks. 
p99
aVIt's not the nicotine for me - I chew, Juul, snus and everything.  But I automatically smoke when it comes down to it.  Habit?  I don't even remember the non-smoking years of my life I was so young.
p100
aVSorry that happened to you hope you have a speedy smooth recovery! Maybe you could get a Juul and try that, it\u2019s not the same as smoking but it really helps a lot with getting a nicotine fix. Sounds like she is being sort of overbearing, she just wants the best for you, so don\u2019t hold it against her too much, but maybe you could ask another family member to help wheel you outside at certain times for a smoke break, and vape in the meantime until you get better.
p101
aVdont want to be that guy, but ask one of your friends to get you a juul, imo its a "good enough" alternative where you won't go crazy
p102
aVIf you don\u2019t appreciate the taste of the tobacco maybe you should try vaping. You may end up liking it more than smoking and there\u2019s less of a starting curb. Although I prefer tobacco many people prefer the buzz and taste of a vape. Try out a juul if your interested, it has a high nicotine content and a variety of flavors.
p103
aVI like the light greens and AS burn much slower so you in theory smoke less more so because of that as opposed to the supposed lack of additives. For me the light greens are the only AS I can tolerate, the others just are really harsh and unsatisfying to me. The AS light greens have a decent minty taste though which makes them tolerable. I\u2019m using my Juul quite a bit which definitely cuts back on my smoking. Thinking about trying the patch at some point, nicotine gum is gross, Chantix didn\u2019t work for me, so I\u2019m Juuling and smoking maybe 5-6 cigarettes a day trying to keep it at a minimum.
p104
aVI don\u2019t even smoke cigs tbh, only juul sometimes, but I love to keep that image ready at all times for situations like this where people are wondering why they don\u2019t get a buzz anymore. My recommendation: try to take a break, and you should get that buzz back for a little bit.
p105
aV30 a day is normal.  This will be my first winter with a Juul and I don't like getting all bundled up for a couple cigs, so I'm cutting back along with the temperature.
p106
aVI see the juul pods. I do the same to cut down. Not a menthol fan though with the cigs
p107
aVCan't imagine that. I remember being able to get camel crushes for under $5 just a few years ago, now both them and Marlboros are nearly $7\u000a\u000a\u000aI've been using the juul for the past 2 years and a 4 pack of pods is $17, not sure if Im actually saving money, though I do enjoy it more
p108
aVI roll filterless, I feel like a dying breed in NYC, everyone is wrapped up in Juuls and vapes
p109
aVBeen messing around with a juul for the past week or so, and the mango flavor is great with OG red bull. 
p110
aVDepends on you're going. \u000aOn a date: Juul\u000aTo the bar with the guys: Camels 
p111
aVI'm taking a girl out so probably JUUL
p112
aVBin the Juul just go with tobacco 
p113
aVYes true, I never get same buzz from the JUUL that's I do the cigarette 
p114
aVDamn must hate me then lol I have a suorin rn. Used to have a juul but once I stopped getting much of a buzz I sold it at cost and got a suorin for a stronger buzz. However, nothing compares to the nostalgia of a nice dart
p115
aVSee this is a real soldier, once we see juuls start to appear there is a problem with the training.. \u000a\u000aThank you for serving bro!
p116
aVSan Francisco going to ban fruit flavored juices. Juul is the way to go however, it\u2019s not even the health benefits from switching I vouch for it\u2019s less heavy on the head (always felt like a neurotoxin smoking).
p117
aVLove em, juul especially 
p118
aVLove my Juul.  The buzz is beyond cigarettes but the habit, heat, and image bring me to cigs when possible.
p119
aVHaha, yes! I picked up a juul along the way. That shit is crazy. Right after I got it, I was vaping in the car on my 45 min commute to work. With nicotine stacked on the pint of Paleo coffee and a tab of Provigil, I was a wild animal that day. I cranked out a week's worth of work. Fun ride, but my pulse was 120ish, so I was like "better not do this every day," lol.\u000a\u000aAs for "coping mechanisms" and whatnot, you are projecting HARD, brother. I picked up smoking because I wanted to experience it. I'm sure I have much left to learn, and if some ugly cravings are part of the ride, so be it!\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;
p120
aVTheir isn't much to experience. It tastes bad. You stay on it long enough until it slightly rewires your brain so it doesn't taste so much like ash. The buzzes and "benefits" you have go away fast.\u000a\u000aThe JUUL is a high salt nic delivery system. It isn't meant for taste really. If you are feeling classy, grab a Voopoo alpha one with the valr tank. Looks like a cassette, you can have stuff that tastes good, and get the nicotine if you want it that badly.\u000a\u000aOh well. At least natural selection is at work here.
p121
aVSo now that you experienced it... do you want to quit? or do you genuinely enjoy being an addict haha (also get a juul so you won't smell bad)
p122
aVI have "quit" with Juul and Snus myself, but I think there's just something about a cigarette that I can't resist.  Oh well :)

aVNat Sherman\u2019s are top top quality. Hints are so pleasant it\u2019s like actual mint not gross chemical Menthol at all. They\u2019re smooth sweet and slightly refreshing but with nice refined tobacco taste very well balanced. And they\u2019re pretty mild so I may smoke them some when I\u2019m not on my Juul. Havana Ovals are my favorites! Possibly my favorite cigarette I\u2019ve ever smoked. They\u2019re unique. Have a rich, nutty, almost tangy smell. Great draw, being nonfiltered, and very rich, pleasant tobacco taste, tangy, spicy, similar to the Cigarettellos but better. They\u2019re strong but clean, natural, compared to Camel nonfilters which are strong but will almost knock you over from the nicotine, these are insanely pleasant, almost like a cigar. I\u2019m obsessed.
p125
aVI\u2019m also 17, used to love that combo. Damn Juul has taken over my life. Cigs taste horrible now and there\u2019s no buzz. I regret getting a Juul.
p126
aVClosest I can think of is those fucking Juuls or whatever the fuck, I see a lot of kids using them.
p127
aVAs for electronic cigarettes.vuse used to make one called vuse vibe and it was the absolute best and literally broke my heart when they discontinued it just heart broken fuck still pisses me off and then they maid the ciro and it just was not the same and they also have the solo but doesn't come close to what what the vibe was.the next best is juul imo.or you could try gum i enjoyed that a bit i recommend Virginia tobacco flavor,juul doesn't even come close to vuse vibe.god dammit i was fucking torn.
p128
aVJUUL helps when I need to quite for a month, idk about long term though.
p129
aVbro don\u2019t smoke inside. your house will reek of cigarette smoke permanently and there\u2019s a 90% chance your land lord won\u2019t let you do it anyway.  regardless of how high-quality your cigs are, the smell will always be kinda trashy imo. just but a juul or suorin for indoors, save the cigarettes for the porch. trust me, i\u2019ve lived in an apartment with 5 other smokers and it\u2019s not fun to have your home smell like smoldering cigarettes 24/7 365.
p130
aVYou got it,though i cant say "permanently"because i dont know about that honestly but i would guess for along time.as far as other people knowing,i would say the average adult smoker has some to moderate understanding of this,as for kids smoking i dont think the average kid smoking or not has any idea(they should be teaching that shit in schools in my opinion)witch is why the antismoking commercials should be waaaay more informative for one because scaring kids 12-17 is kind if pointless to some extent because they are rebellious and the commercials look like there trying to scare you and kids can pick up on that  shit but adults dont think about that,and they know that can happen at  the worst case scenario,and if they smoke feel guilt rather then being "scared"and for adults that dont smoke feel relieved that they quit or never started,so why do they make those commercials well either to advertise smoking or in some places so they dont have to ruin there packs with those pictures.and to answer some of your other questions the first time i smoked was when i came home  from the beach with some friends dropped my towel on the way out of the car and saw a pack under the seat assuming my mom lost it(she did)and when my friends left i went back for it and smoked in the bathroom,my mom is a chronic smoker very unfortunately and her health very very bad for it she coughs allot,she would always smoke in the car and when i was a kid i fucking HATED it,i started when i was 13 now 20.and to add i knew fucking nothing about it when i started.have i tryed to quit cigarettes but not nicotine nicotine i used gum and sometimes juul(i enjoyed the Virginia flavor allot)and haven't smoked in almost a year but then i lost my job and couldn't afford it anymore,went right back to cigarettes but found a new job that pays less.
p131
aVHere's a $15 on your first purchase on JUUL.com
p132
aVPower through. If you really can\u2019t beat it, get a Juul or similar vape for the nicotine. 
p133
aVI do both, I use a juul when I'm inside so I don't make everything smell like smoke, but I also only go through a pack a week so vaping is more expensive for me lol. 
p134
aVEver thought about switching to juul?
p135
aVHop on aliexpress, search up iCare mini. Get that, similar as a juul, but you can put your own juice in. Its hell of a lot cheaper.
p136
aVSupposed to be quitting and just vape since I have a mod and juul but fuck..
p137
aVI\u2019m not a scientist. But the way nicotine is absorbed through vaporization vs combustion is different. I\u2019d say start low and work your way up til you\u2019re satisfied. If it\u2019s a salt based liquid (pod mod device) start around 25mg and move up to 50 if need be. Freebase nicotine (on a sub-ohm setup) start at 3mg and move up to 6 if you need to. Or just get a juul or comparable closed-pod system, but be careful with those because they can get expensive. If you\u2019re not gonna be using it a lot, only when you can\u2019t smoke, it should work fine for you. I hope this helped at least a little lol. 
p138
aVJust buy a Juul.
p139
aVYou'd be surprised how close the modern vapes have been getting to mimicking a cigarette. The JUUL is a prime example of that. 
p140
aVNever really tried juuls but its still a vape in the end they can never compare to a cig 
p141
aVNot my thing really il see if any of the people i know have a juul and il bum it off them 
p142
aVI picked it up daily right away.  That was back when most everybody did it, so whenever I'd see somebody smoke it was irresistible.  These days I smoke almost 2 packs a day, but less if I Juul or chew.  So maybe that's my advice for when you become a chainsmoker.
p143
aVThis crap coupled with the FDA threatening Juul and other e-cig manufacturers... bunch of shit is what it is. 
p144
aVJuul is the best way to smoke less I think.  I also chew tobacco sometimes.  Without them, a pack of cigarettes lasts about 12 hours or less.  Yesterday I smoked like 35 cigarettes.
p145
aVI would Juul if I had a non-smoking girl if it was a big deal to her and I really liked her.
p146
aVThis is cringeworthy, but I\u2019ve been able to  go through a juul pod in two days and go many days without urges.
p147
aVYou're doing better then me. I experimented with cigs soon as I was old enough and never really got hooked from them at all, just enjoyed social smoking a lot. Went ahead and got a vape instead since I was more attracted to the act of inhaling and exhaling something other then air more so then smoking cigs. I started to miss the throat hit a little so I picked up a juul and went thru a pod a day for a month lmao trying to cut back now
p148
aVI mean, you can either ween down to 2-5 cigs a day. But what got me off the stinkies (which you have to want to quit cold turkey with the switch) is vaping. Everything else didn't work. Now I still miss cigarettes, but don't really crave them all that intensely (going on about a year and a half from quitting if memory serves right.) Try a Juul/nic salts, as they're the closest thing that makes me feel like I'm actually smoking and having no cigarette cravings when it comes to the nic buzz/satisfaction. You could also go for cloud like devices if you want, but I feel for a smoker that just wants to ween off while still having an emergency buzz for the hankerings, nic salts (the juice in Juuls basically) are the way to go. It'll be expensive, but the cartridges last long enough for me since the nic buzz hits pretty instant, and you can go overboard if you take too many hits and get nicotine sickness pretty easy with juuls with how powerful their juice/nic salts are.  
p149
aVOh yeah for sure. If it\u2019s not nic salts. Aka the juul.
p150
aVI mainly use my Juul and snus, but I do enjoy smoking cigs from time to time. 
p151
aVI sorta juggle a bit less than a pack a day, JUUL and dip.
p152
aVVaping, at its current state, is too much work. Even the juul, supposedly the most convenient vape, leaks all the time, in addition to burnt tasting pods. Also the flavors are tolerable at best, with any juice. Vaping is far better for health blah blah, etc.\u000a
p153
aVCigarettes are my favorite but Juul packs more nic.  I get a bit light headed from 8-10 hits.  Highly recommended. 
p154
aVSuch a waste. Ban them to discourage youths from smoking, and then the Juul comes around. Good job FDA
p155
aVPS i love Juul :)
p156
aVI\u2019m obsessed with the creme brûlée Juul pods and ironically it\u2019s the one that I thought I\u2019d like the least. I still need my regular cigarettes but have drastically cut down. Marlboro ultra lights are ok they do the job and are pretty light. Most cigarettes just don\u2019t taste good to me any more. I\u2019m hopefully going to try some cloves because I love the smell of clove but until I get those I\u2019m hiding my time and my Juul is doing its job.
p157
aVNo judgement here man. We all do the same shit from different outlooks or perspectives.  I can\u2019t put my finger on what it is about cigarettes maybe the added chemicals, nostalgia, taste, and Habitual stress relief association. I got a juul vape and it\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve found to moderate my smoking from two packs to half a pack a day. It\u2019s got similar nicotine content but it takes time to get used to. I like to use it as a substitute for a second or third smoke so I can smoke higher quality cigarettes and cut back.
p158
aVI am pretty sure that Juul could do away with cigarettes for me if I tried.  For now it's just a rescue device.  There's a non smoking lady I want to hook up with and maybe it will spur me if I get lucky.
p159
aVVapes definitely aren\u2019t as good but they can help. Tobacco juice is always shit but fruit flavors are alright if they ain\u2019t too sweet. I just like the juul cause the draw is similar to a cig and similar nicotine hit. I don\u2019t like fancy mod vapes or nothing cause it has to be as convenient as opening a pack. \u000a
p160
aVI've been vaping for a couple months and I enjoy smoking a lot more. I'll still smoke a cig here and there. But since I got a Juul, I've not smoked nearly as much. I miss it, cause it's so atmospheric and chill. \u000a\u000aAnyways, good luck man.
p161
aVTry a Juul, still has the feel of a cig with lots of nicotine. But if cold turkey works, do it
p162
aVI've used juuls, they feel nothing like cigs to me. It's really not about the nicotine for me.
p163
aVFirst one in the morning makes me high, usually in about 30 seconds.  Other than that, only my Juul or a fat lip of chew give me a buzz.
p164
aVIt\u2019s not even like cigs are making it worse, they just taste gross for the most part. A lot of things aside from cigs taste gross to me rn too. Can barely taste my Juul as well. Menthols do seem to help in small doses though. 
p165
aVI hit the gym regularly and occasionally play soccer. While it hasn\u2019t affected me much at the gym, I did notice myself breathing harder during heavier workouts like squats and deadlifts. Doesn\u2019t affect me much, just an observation. \u000aI was never a big fan of cardio, so I couldn\u2019t tell you about that.\u000a\u000aWith that said, I tend to have pretty bad workout sessions if I smoke right before the gym; I usually try to avoid it.\u000a\u000aSoccer wise, I\u2019ve definitely noticed my stamina decreasing because of it. While I can still sprint down the line, I would usually be floored after than, in contrast to still being able to run some more in the past.\u000a\u000aObligatory: Don\u2019t pick up smoking. I\u2019ve been not smoking on-and-off (it\u2019s between smoking a couple of cigarettes a day and juuling now) for the past 6 months, and it\u2019s the best decision I\u2019ve ever made, short of quitting. 
p166
aVIn the same boat over here, but still using my Juul until I have money for cigs  
p167
aVget a juul 
p168
aVI\u2019m not up to date on all these smoking vape alternatives. Is Juul extra special or beneficial than other flavored vaping kits/pens? 
p169
aVJuuling is much more similar to smoking than vaping is because the nicotine is in salt form instead of freebase (Which is what normal vapes use) 
p170
aVJuul is, on average, much higher in nicotine than other e-cig kits. It\u2019s easy to use and also less likely to shit out than cheaper e-cigs. The body of the smoke is lighter so you don\u2019t belch giant fruity dragonesque smoke clouds while using it too. The flavor variety, while lacking overall, is better than some alternatives as well. Give it a shot, it\u2019s not too bad. 
p171
aVJuul
p172
aVJuuls are pretty accessible and what I'm using rn; blu e-cigs are okay but last less than a day for me.
p173
aV10/10 recommend Juuls. I\u2019ve reached the point where I actually enjoy my Juul as my regular instead of cigarettes; I still enjoy an occasional cigarette but regular smoking grosses me out now that I\u2019ve experienced all the nicotine rush without the stink or short breath. 
p174
aVA Juul is a stronger nicotine hit.  Try cigarettes - Camel Menthol Silvers.
p175
aVI'd buy him a Juul if he hasn't tried that before. He should also go to some addiction treatment service. If he's been serious about quitting for a long time, he should really get a lot of help. 
p176
aVBuy him a Juul. Maybe he\u2019ll quit, maybe he won\u2019t. But it\u2019s an attempt. \u000a\u000aI certainly don\u2019t smoke regularly anymore, but then again I haven\u2019t been smoking for 30 years. 
p177
aVI've heard juuls are worse for you but idk
p178
aVTrying vaping.   \u000aI think you'd also enjoy nasal snuff, which is like a find powder that you keep in your nose. They're usually scented and offer a pretty good buzz, while not being linked to any real cancers. I think it has something to do with the nasal intake of it. Vaping/Juuling is defiantly the safest option if you craze a nicotine buzz, aside from patches and gums. 
p179
aVI mean i know its bad but some of my friends vape or juul all day like legit 1-2 pods a day or smoke 1-3 joints i think this is the lesser evil
p180
aVWell thats why im looking for the mildest one. I know the risks but i do believe vaping multiple pods a day is worse than if i can smoke in moderation. I know i can and most likely will get addicted but is it really different from juuls? Anyhow it is my life i can make stupid decisions. I dont drink or do drugs, im not a 'degenerate,' and cigars are a great experience and i would like that feel more often.
p181
aVYes smoking much different than Juuls. Juuls don't produce tar and carbon monoxide or produce hundreds of toxic byproducts. This could be wrong but as far as we know vaping us much safer than smoking. I recommend you stay away from anything with nicotine as it as very addictive and expensive. It's also really not that great of a drug. It's nice at first but eventually you feel nothing and all you're doing is fueling an addiction.
p182
aVThe JUUL made me sick
p183
aVIt was the same way at first when I started Juuling to cut back. Don't care much for vaping but it's a good way to cut back on cigs and be able to get that sweet sweet nicotine indoors. I felt like shit (nausea) when I started juuling but after awhile it's subsided. I also had an ulcer when I switched which caused nausea and stomach pain and have been slowly recovering from that so maybe that's why I haven't been as nauseous lately. Some Juul flavors fuck with acid reflux quite a bit if you have that.
p184
aVI remember chaining about 25 rips off the JUUL and the buzz only lasted about 5 - 10 minutes just imagine the tolerance I used to have... lol
p185
aVYeah, a lot of juul pod flavors just stick to your throat- the taste and smell aren\u2019t great after a while lol
p186
aVI promise to you that I won't quit.  Ever.  I started smoking as a kid before I had hair on my chest, it's hard to remember life without cigarettes.  Not the nicotine that keeps from giving it up - I chew and have Juul too.  I need to be smoking.
p187
aVHave you tried vaping? I dont use my juul any longer, but in terms of the whole physical aspect of smoking I found it pretty useful. I only actually stopped because it was really just as expensive as smoking, but for me it was a very useful tool in cessation. good luck man
p188
aVThat seems reasonable. I personally use my Juul most of the day and only smoke when with a friend or as a treat. 
p189
aVI like the Juul but it only works halfway for me because it doesn\u2019t leave a lingering tobacco taste like a cigarette does. So not sure how much longer I\u2019ll use it. I\u2019m going to try Swedish snus and smoke Luckies occasionally. I figure if I do smoke why not make it good. Most filtered cigarettes taste bad and smell bad. 
p190
aVThe addiction for me isn't nicotine as much as the ritual.  I've been smoking for almost 25 years, and I still want cigarettes if I'm chewing or Juuling, which both have more nicotine.  Newports or bust in other words, although I currently chew a can on the weekends too.
p191
aVMine are:\u000a\u000aJuul/e cig: For most of my daily nicotine consumption since I've cut back a lot, just enjoy being able to vape while I'm working inside on uni coursework/having a few hits in bed when I first wake up.\u000a\u000aLucky Strike: Daily brand when I'm visiting the US, a strong and flavorful classic.\u000a\u000aKamel Reds or Camel Filters: Choice smokes when a shop does not carry nonfilters, when I'm short on cash, or I just want a milder smoke.\u000a\u000aMarlboro Southern Cut, Virginia Blend, Blend 27s, Nat Sherman Reds, or Export A Rich: Occassional indulgence when I want a fancier/smoother, sweeter smoke.\u000a\u000aGolden Virginia Midnight: Daily rolling tobacco when I'm at uni in North Wales. Tastes like Chesterfield NF.\u000a\u000aMarlboro Gold Cut: Rolling Tobacco when GV M isn't in stock.\u000a\u000aSenior Service: Favorite nonfilter smoke in the U.K. when I have extra money to burn.
p192
aVJuul mint and Newport 100's full flavor.  I also like to chew at home but usually not enough time for that at work.
p193
aVThose in bed Juul hits tho
p194
aVMine run the gambit: \u000a\u000aLucky Strike for relaxing and those certain moments or when I just need a damn good smoke. \u000a\u000aPall Mall Ultra Lights for everyday/social smoking when I don\u2019t want a heavy smoke and just need a light enjoyable cig.\u000a\u000aJuul for late night in bed or anytime I need a pick me up without smoking. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p195
aVI\u2019ve been wrestling with this too. I guess if you smoke more light cigarettes to get a fix then you\u2019re probably also inhaling deeper and it might actually be slightly worse than if you smoke fewer regular stronger cigarettes. I know like say if I smoke Parliament Lights, I can go through almost a whole pack in a day without realizing it, but if it\u2019s say a Marlboro Red or a stronger cigarette I would definitely not light as many of those up because they simply hit harder. Neither are good. For me it\u2019s all in moderation I now smoke less and enjoy it more, and fuller flavored smokes when I do. If i smoke a full flavor cigarette I keep it to about 1-3 per day, and do my Juul the rest of the time. Many light cigarettes I don\u2019t care for anyway, and I\u2019d smoke way more of them.
p196
aVGood vapes are more available. The juul is pretty cheap long term and hits alright. If that\u2019s too weak you can find even stronger. 
p197
aVJuul. Virginia tobacco or menthol pods. No further elaboration needed. 
p198
aVJuul, but I still mostly smoke.  Juul saves my ass for a fix in a pinch.
p199
aVI'm sure most smokers know the risks very well. Ultimately, it's your choice. Vape pens/mods and juul are good alternatives. Personally, I just enjoy smoking, it relaxes me and calms my appetite. I try not to do more than 1 or 2 per day. Everyone is different, but moderation is always good \U0001f44c
p200
aVIt\u2019s the nicotine rush, the escape, and the ritual that has me smoking. Especially when I\u2019m having a wild day at work. I will tell you what older smokers say: \u201cDon\u2019t start\u201d. But if you decide to start, I\u2019d recommend Camels or American Spirits and also be sure to pace yourself.  If you don\u2019t want ye olde \u201ccancer sticks\u201d, I\u2019d say a Juul is a reliable and easy to use option that can deliver nicotine without the scary carcinogens. It won\u2019t do much right away but after years of heavy smoking you may notice a difference. Or you may not. Lots of heavy smokers have other unhealthful habits aside from cigarettes that may cause their demise. 
p201
aVJuuls are pretty strong too. I usually smoke NAS Black but if I haven't had one in a while or like the first time a day 2 good drags off a juul will put me on my ass. They also last longer than any other E-cig I've tried. 
p202
aVJuuls are definitely very strong. 1 pod &gt;= 1 pack of cigs, right? 
p203
aVIf you're willing to give vaping a try, the Juul and Suorin Drop are both satisfying pod vapes, as well as good entry level devices. Salt juices will probably get you buzzed if you choose a high enough nic level; For example: 65 mg/mL. \u000a\u000aIf you'd prefer cigs, consider a tolerance break. 
p204
aV"Lmao there are kids peeing in the juul room"
p205
aVI quit with Juul a while ago and still come back every day. I just l like tobacco and love the community.
p206
aVGood luck! I hope the Juul works as well for you as it did for me.
p207
aVJuul's are trash, invest in a good vape, you'll never go back. Only reason I did was because mine was stolen.
p208
aVI\u2019ve got a few smok mods but I just don\u2019t get the same nicotine that I do in juuls and besides I can carry it around with me without it weighing down my pocket.
p209
aVI did the same but honestly as much as a juul buzzes you, there\u2019s nothing like the vibe of lighting a cigarette and relaxing. It\u2019s just different.
p210
aVYeah i understand that. Someone on the juul subreddit did the math the other day and juul pods at 1 pod a day vs cigs at one pack was still about 700$ cheaper per year.\u000a\u000a
p211
aVI got a Juul and like it but sometimes I forget how often I hit it and it\u2019s pretty potent. And sometimes I still need 1-2 cigarettes a day. Morning and after meals mainly. It\u2019s helped me cut back more than any other vape ever did but I just have to watch how much I hit it like socially because it can really get too much too fast.
p212
aVI use my juul and smoke a pack every 2-3 days. 
p213
aVJuul reaction?
p214
aVThanks for the comment yea there haven\u2019t been any changes at all other than I\u2019m using my Juul a lot. It seems to be after I hit it a few times is when the itching and rashes on my legs flare up and then subsides but they are still there. Maybe it is chigger bites the doctor thought so when I first went to her with the rashes bit maybe the Juul juice is aggravating them or causing them to take longer to heal. Dunno, but I\u2019m going to not use the Juul for a few days and see how it gets. 
p215
aVMaybe it\u2019s just too much nicotine. Because I smoke some still and also use the Juul. I probably need to pick one or the other. I will say this..when I smoke, I smoke one and that\u2019s it for awhile. I\u2019ll hit the Juul constantly and forget how many times I\u2019ve hit it. That can\u2019t be a great thing.
p216
aVyou may be allergic  to pg, there are juices out there albeit not for the juul that are free of pg, i personally use those because i think pg tastes disgusting
p217
aVI've been smoking for 24 years and the first one still gives me a shiver in the morning.  Also my Juul hits hard any time of day.  If you really want a kick, try chew.
p218
aVNot really the taste so much as something to do. I\u2019ve always been kind of fidgety all my life and smoking takes my mind off it. That way I\u2019m doing something with my hands and getting relaxed as a result. Of course, high quality cigs and Vitamin N help too. I go back and forth between my Juul and my smokes depending on where I\u2019m at or who I\u2019m with. And it\u2019s fun to share it with friends.
p219
aVI had a sore throat a few days ago and had a couple cigarettes plus my Juul and it didn\u2019t bother me too much. 
p220
aVproof cigarettes are healthier than vape and juul
p221
aVGot addicted very fast and very young\u000a\u000aI love nicotine and its hobby culture and i have to deal with the addiction part\u000a\u000a\u000aThe answer is yourself STICK TO WHAT YOU SAID every time you are out fishing or whatever go ahead but maybe not every time\u000a\u000aIf you dont listen to yourself one day you're gonna have a bad day and smoke a cigar or a cig then you'll limit yourself to one a day and then you'll break that\u000a\u000aIts a expensive habit man\u000a\u000a\u000aLook into JUUL if you dont want to damage your health it has 50mg nicotine and every pod is equivalent to a pack but be careful its portable and stealthy and like me you'll be hitting it without even noticing
p222
aVI was looking into the Juul. How does it compare to an actual cigarette though? I know the nicotine is there which is good but how are the flavors compared to lighting up a real cig?
p223
aVThe throught hit is better than a cig IMO.\u000a\u000aThe nicotine is much more higher with good flavors\u000a\u000aIts portable and i used to take it everywhere and could get my fix in tge comfort of anywhere really\u000a\u000aI will always miss lighting up a cig but now i miss the crackle of the JUUL ;)
p224
aVI second this. JUUL is so convenient compared to other vapes. Its stealthy too and if you ghost it you can do it anywhere. The only downside is that it is costly. But in thenlong run ita worth it. You have VUSE which I say is a huge rip off and will be returning to the store every 5 hours for new carts or the blu that leaks
p225
aVCan confirm currently ghosting in cousins car next to a newborn :3\u000a\u000aTheres so many ripoffs out there but the juul is well worth the price IMO 
p226
aVBack when I was juuling I would hit it constantly at work, and it kinda killed my work ethic. I would just be hitting it all day, developed a worse cough from the juul than I ever did from cigarettes. I switched back to cigs.
p227
aVThis might be a psychological problem.\u000a\u000aIm using 55mg nicoting on my vape and feel nothing but relief on it but I STILL smoke a Newport every now and then because when used to smoke they would help me a fuckton during my depression and it helps me remind me of that. I don't smoke for the nicotine at all\u000a\u000a\u000aThat being said i quit VERY easily with a JUUL hence my username\u000a\u000aTry a starter pack and limit yourself on your use then quit cold turkey\u000a\u000aYou won't need cigs anymore i believe in you
p228
aVI use a Juul too and let me tell you I\u2019ve had extreme depression and smoking has been one of the few things that can pull me out of it. Nothing worked for me either I got a Juul though and this has really cut back my smoking. I still like to smoke a cigarette but in moderation and the Juul is this only thing that has ever made a dent in my smoking. All that other vape shit did nothing for me
p229
aVSeriously, try a JUUL. I love smoking, but i've been trying to quit in an effort to get more healthy. Long story short, i picked up a JUUL because i heard it uses a different kind of juice  (nic salts or something) that feels more like a cig in the throat. Now, i only buy packs if i'm super stressed out or something. 
p230
aVWell, as far as the claim that it's a psychological problem, I'm a computer programmer. So, when you're building a system that can self-reverse engineer itself at runtime to produce its own source code dynamically from a filesystem based configuration rather than a code base at runtime, well, you're in some deep levels of logic that can quickly induce headache, and when that headache triggers, or when I feel nerve tension all throughout my body, or in my stomach, or wherever, then comes the need for that cigarette.   \u000a\u000a\u000aSince the brain ultimately controls the rest of the body, you might on the one hand consider it a psychological problem, but upon closer inspection, you might realize an underlying problem that when the mind is under increasingly difficult amounts of stress, beyond that which probably 99%ish of people experience according to statistics, well then, it seems to be an autonomous release of stress, paradoxical as it seems, because it's both relieving it on the one hand, and worsening it on the other, which is in my estimation, "not good." Thusly, consciously I really can't stand smoking or cigarettes, but still I have an impulsive feeling right in this moment to have one because I've got an upset stomach and nerve tension, and it wants to be settled, and the pain from which is so intense that it is basically motivating me enough to get up and want to go have a cigarette, even though I'm comfortable on my couch right now.  \u000a\u000a\u000aSo that said, how's the Juul differ necessarily from whatever e-cig or vape system that I can buy at a regular local Wal-mart or gas station or smoke shop? There's a few options like the Blu for example, which I tried, and it was basically what I would consider "placebo", as in, it seemed to make me smoke more, rather than less. I tried to use a Blu, as a transitioning mechanism to taper and quit, but I ended up defaulting back to the American Spirit, which was obviously a mistake.
p231
aVTheres a ton of quality issues with other E-cigs and even the JUUL but it delivers a ton of nicotine you Litterly can't get on cigs and other ecigs\u000a\u000aTry the JUUL and when you feel an intense craving use it. Be careful though it should get you off cigs but getting off the juul is very hard also
p232
aVReally.  Snus was my best friend in a non-smoking place until I discovered Juul.  
p233
aVI think Chantix or benzos make smoking look almost healthy in comparison. Really evil stuff. If they had something to offer, I would listen. But good to hear docs are not all judgemental.\u000a\u000aIf iqos ever gets approved, I hear it works better than vaping or Juul.
p234
aVI don\u2019t smoke but I use a Juul once in a while 
p235
aVJesus is obviously an American Spirit rollie kind of guy, who occasionally enjoys a Nat Sherman or a Djarum. He would rather nail himself to a cross than touch a Marlboro product. He personally sent several people to hell for choosing to discontinue Chesterfields, and he saturates his beard in vape juice so he can smell like a fresh cloud at all times. He takes every opportunity to mentions snus and then deliberately acts disappointed when people don't know what he's talking about. He changed his last named to Juul and his porn folder is simply filled with smoking scenes from Mad Men.
p236
aVJuul Experience so far
p237
aVI\u2019d be curious to know this as well. I\u2019m trying to decide if a Juul would be worth the investment.
p238
aVYeah the juul helps me cut down.  Nothing is the same as a cig tho
p239
aVSame for me honestly. \u000aMy sister got one for the fuck of it and I tried it and was amazed. At first it did hit a little hard but now i\u2019m used to it. Went from smoking half a pack as well, to 1 every 3 days with the Juul. I love how convenient it is too, I can use it in my room and car and it doesn\u2019t smell! I love my Juul, even if it has a silly meme for high schoolers. 
p240
aVGet a pod vape\u000a Juuls and their pods are overpriced.
p241
aVI feel, been using a Juul since I have an ulcer atm and smoking is really bad for that (nicotine itself isn't the best for it but I've given up alcohol, coffee, and most of the foods I enjoy so a niccy rush cant be so bad), but I've still had a cig here and there. The Juul is more meeting a need for nicotine, but the minute I light up a cig my brain thinks "hello old friend". 
p242
aVYou really can\u2019t beat the Juul for a convenient easy no frills vape. It\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s helped me drastically cut back smoking and that\u2019s saying something! I still want to try some other flavors but I like the mint but I want to try the Mango or the Cucumber maybe sometime.  Gotta say though I still like a regular cigarette now and then just for the satisfaction of lighting up and enjoying a real smoke like I was used to but now it\u2019s more of a luxury not a habit thanks to the Juul. Not sure I can ever give up regular tobacco completely I like it too much but we shall see. I do plan on starting to work out so maybe that will help stem cravings and in the meantime more Juul for me. Nothing beats a nice Camel though sometimes haha not even the Juul can.
p243
aVYeah man I figured no kids really smoke anymore so its highly unlikely they would even think twice about me being under 21 with the generation of JUULing.
p244
aVGot a Juul today...
p245
aVNice\u000a\u000aTook me a bit to switch but its been amazing quiting\u000a\u000aHear me out and try to use the juul instead of your next pack buy a pack of pods
p246
aVI\u2019ll consider it. I\u2019m a light smoker to begin with, as in it\u2019s unusual for me to smoke more than 4 cigs in a day. I\u2019m certainly not trying to ignore possible health impacts, im aware it\u2019d be a good idea to quit now. But we\u2019ll see, I\u2019m still warming up to the Juul. I can\u2019t see it replacing select cigs as of yet. The ritual, the taste, the smell (while smoking) is still pretty appealing to me. I\u2019m also apprehensive of being hooked on nicotine and taking down a pod a day like some of my friends. 
p247
aVI 100% know what you mean. Newprts used to taste incredible a bit minty and smelled sweet\u000a\u000aI smoked a newport today and it was actually disgusting the smell lingered and had to put it out mid way\u000a\u000a\u000aI quit cigs and but was using a juul (50mg) fir awhile then upgraded to a bigger more complicated vape with 55mg and with that it absorbed more nic per hit \u000a\u000aNow im weening off with 3mg and plan to quit for good
p248
aVJuul is a great tool to cut back on smoking or quit. Worked for me
p249
aVI\u2019ve thought about getting one too. I live in a loft so it takes me a while to get to my deck to smoke, and a Juul would be something I could use inside, or in a friend\u2019s car without leaving behind a cigarette smell.
p250
aVI don't like the juul flavors at all, but the 5 percent juice is pretty strong. Headrush man, don't ever get those back then when i was addicted
p251
aVJust had a non-filter this morning. Still tasted good. Wish the Juul had stronger flavor..
p252
aVThe first one after I wake up always feels nice, the buzz comes in about 15 seconds.  Any time I smoke weed I get an uncontrollable urge to have a cigarette after 30-40 minutes, and that one is also blissful.  Lately I've been working on stretching out the time between cigs and recognizing the difference between smoking out of habit and smoking for nicotine.\u000a\u000aAll that said, the best nic hit comes in a can of Copenhagen :)  Juul is pretty close if you really hit it hard.
p253
aVJUUL doesn't compare to Copenhagen Snuff, shit will knock you on the floor. Next step up is Jack Daniels.
p254
aVJuul is great but nothing beats having a morning stoke
p255
aVI agree.  Juul at work, but can't beat the real thing with black coffee.
p256
aVCan't beat the real thing with anything man, cigs relax me at work juul gets me all hyper and shit.
p257
aVI use a juul too sometimes. I look at it like this. Smoking a cig is like coke, but the juul is like crack lmao
p258
aVI just got a Juul and love it it\u2019s definitely helping me cut way back on regular cigs but that morning cig is still needed lol. Or after a meal. It\u2019s a good balance because I\u2019m not constantly smoking cigarettes but I\u2019m enjoying the few I am. now more.
p259
aVAnd JUUL is expensive as fuck 
p260
aVI loathed Marlboro Lights. Awful taste not an enjoyable smoking experience at all. I have to say that IMO L&amp;M Blues are a lot better and for less money. They taste better and burn slower. I use the JUUL now but when I do smoke an occasional cigarette I like something full flavored and high quality.
p261
aVIt\u2019s my girlfriends \U0001f62a but it\u2019s a juul
p262
aVThoughts on the Juul?
p263
aVJuuls are the most like cigarettes imo. I've had mine for 2 years and its been great. The only downside is that the flavors aren't that good - no good tobacco flavors and only the mint and mango flavors are passable.\u000a\u000aYou have to remember that the juul is marketed and acts as a smoking alternative, if getting off nicotine is your goal then the juul isnt for you. With that said many of my friends have used the juul to successfully stop smoking when traditional vapes didn't work
p264
aV7-11 has a deal right now for $20 off the starter kit if you're 21+ and have the rewards card.\u000a\u000aAlso the juul will be harsh in the beginning but just give it some time and you'll get used to it
p265
aVThe pods are like 50mg so I kinda worry that\u2019s too much for the heart but I guess if you only take like a single puff that will do the job for awhile before you need another. Plus it has to be better than smoking cigarettes right? I see young guys who are looking very athletic with the Juul all the time. I have a couple of coworkers who smoked but have the Juul now and they seem to like it.
p266
aVI got a Juul about a month ago with mint pods and I love it. Haven\u2019t smoked much since but I don\u2019t get to smoke that often anyways lol. 
p267
aVThe difference is the nic salts e juice. Much smoother so you can use high nicotine. Closed systems like the Juul and Phix include this. You can also put this juice in a refillable open pod system like the Aspire Breeze 2. \u000a\u000aThese also don't make a big cloud, so they can be stealthy. Unlike with a sub-ohm tank, no one has ever given me the stink eye for using a Juul.
p268
aVYea this vape juice and I\u2019ve only been using 6mg hurts my throat it\u2019s rough and hurts sometimes to inhale. And gives me zero satisfaction. I never cared about stupid big clouds or anything I only wanted to stop smoking cigarettes but this Smok vape hasn\u2019t worked. Just wanted to put a feeler out and see if you guys think the Juul is worth the money if it will get me off cigarettes. 
p269
aVWent ahead and bought a Juul! I got just the device and a usb charger it didn\u2019t come with the sample pods so I bought the cool mint ones separately. Glad I did, tastes nice and wow. Huge buzz very satisfying! Haven\u2019t smoked at all since and no urge to. Light years ahead of my regular vape pen I probably won\u2019t touch that again! 
p270
aVI was thinking of getting a JUUL but they\u2019re not the U.K. yet unfortunately
p271
aVThinking about switching from cigarettes to just Grizzly wintergreen dip and my Juul.  Chew at home, Juul at work.
p272
aVI'm in love with my Juul.  Most people I knew who started smoking regularly in college however were wasted-drunk.  Not me though - I smoked daily age 12 but didn't drink a drop until college.
p273
aVOr a JUUL
p274
aVNeither the JUUL or SNUS will replicate the smoking experience and all the other shit that's in cigarettes.
p275
aVI don't think anything is the same, but I've known a lot of heavy smokers that have quit or stepped down quite a  bit using the JUUL...I've been told the feeling is closer to an actual cigarette than the 'tank' vapes and such.
p276
aVYeah but most people like the flavor of tobacco, not the "tobacco juul pods" that taste like chocolate.
p277
aVaddiction isn't just about the feeling, it's about the ritual of lighting up a smoke, the smell and taste of the tobacco, etc. tbh lighting up a joint helps the craving for a cigarette more than puffing on a juul for a bit
p278
aVI find the Phix tobacco pods more realistic and satisfying than the Juul. The throat hit is intense.\u000a\u000aWhat all vapes lack is staying power. You have to keep vaping. Not like you smoke and then you are ok without it for awhile.\u000aMaybe because they don't have MAOI's.\u000a\u000a
p279
aVSame with a Juul. Hold it in long enough and nothing comes out. I\u2019ve taken many inconspicuous hits at work like that (but too much of a pussy to risk it on a plane). 
p280
aVCan confirm. I went from smoking to Juuling and that buzz kicked my ass every day. Now I\u2019m back to smoking because I\u2019m abroad and have no access to pods, and it\u2019s safe to say I\u2019m nowhere near as addicted to nicotine as I was when I juuled. When I started Juuling, I still craved cigarettes for a while. Now that I\u2019m smoking again, I can\u2019t wait to get back to my juul. 
p281
aVI love my Juul, but can't give up the Newports.  Juul is soooo good - daily.  But no more cigarettes...no way.
p282
aV90 percent of the Juuls I sell go to kids 20 or younger. Barely anyone uses them for their intended purpose: quitting smoking cigs. OP, good luck on quitting. 
p283
aVI have a Juul.  Still just isn't the same but I love that thing.
p284
aVI\u2019m in that boat. I quit a few months ago for good and switched to a Juul and I\u2019ve been loving it. I still had the occasional cigarette at parties or so, but never went back. Now, I\u2019m on vacation overseas and I\u2019m out of juul pods so I went back to smoking cigarettes to get my nic fix, and I get nauseous after every one. I hate the throat burn, the smell, everything. But I love the satisfaction and the flavor. It\u2019s a weird relationship. 
p285
aVHey man! I quit almost exactly 1 month ago! Congrats on making it through the hardest part! For any people thinking about quitting, the Juul reallyyyy helped me, made it easy almost. And I don\u2019t think it will be nearly as difficult to quit the juul in about a month. I loved cigarettes because for those 6-8 minutes it was like a break from life. The juul is just for nicotine, doesn\u2019t make me happy like a cig did, so it will be a lot easier to let go. 
p286
aVExcept for that new "manufacturer funded program".\u000a\u000aI find it funny Juul pods, dip, cigars, ryo, and shisha now have bigger warning labels than cigs.\u000a
p287
aVI second this, 2000s. Most kids "juul" nowadays and if a teenager is smoking its automatically assumed by cops and people they are 18 or older lol.
p288
aVYeah most people juul or vape so I think smoking is just moving in as humans progress. Nicotine is still there and will always be no matter what
p289
aVCongrats man! I'm on my last Juul Blaster today, and I have one Juul Micro (orange flavor), which will last me until Sunday, and from there on out it's just Juul lights and Juul-i-Bee Micros (Purple flavor) for me... stay strong brother 
p290
aVWell I'm 18 now and just graduated this year. I can tell you that everyone uses the JUUL vape, I only know two kids that smoke cigarettes (both still in HS) and they are my friends lol. That's it nowadays, although I do remember walking past the basketball courts when I was around 11 years old and this 18 year old blonde hair kid was smoking a newport menthol with a tank top on, my elementary teacher said hi to him as we walked by with my class and told me he was a former student really nice kid.. I always wanted to grow up and be like him and now I do the same at the basketball courts, I wonder if there are any kids that think the same nowadays? ;)
p291
aVI was a casual smoker starting at about 12-13. I would just split one with my friends, once a week or so, if we could get our hands on some. Then at 15 I had a week alone at my house while my parents went away. I had full access to smoke when I wanted. Ever since that week I noticed strong signs of addiction. I'm 24 now and still have a full blown addiction to nicotine. I have been using a Juul now for about 6 months and it's helped a lot. Not inhaling anything is the best way, but I do feel it's slightly better for you. My lungs and wallet are thanking me too!
p292
aVBelieve me, I did too. To this day they smell so fucking good to me. I know the buzz all too well and it's so inviting and comforting. Since the day I turned 18, I was a pack a day smoker. Usually a bit more though because my job at the time let me smoke on the job so some nights I could go through 2 packs in a 10 hour shift. Then about 3 years later I started coughing up black shit in the morning. I couldn't lay down with out coughing and wheezing. I sounded like a rubber chicken, that was pretty freaky. I got bronchitis about 6 or 7 times within those 3 years. Overall I was a mess so I started to slow down and eventually switched to the Juul. Also paying more for health insurance is wack. 10/10 would not recommend.
p293
aVLol bro, I hate when my friends juul in the morning that shit is fuckin' gross.
p294
aVIts really fucked that kids ain't rippin' darts anymore man. This JUUL epidemic got a pussy reputation for sure.
p295
aVLmao kids use juul cause it's a trend, easy to hide, nice flavors and they can ghost the vapor and get a buzz in class I mean I would love to do that in class lol
p296
aVBro - have you tried the Juul? I\u2019ve been vaping for over 3 years and have seen it get 2 homies off smokes in the last 6 months (its easily the best recreation of a cigarette). I even got one because it\u2019s great for work and driving (I use a dripper at home). 
p297
aVYeah give it a shot. I\u2019m 40 and just recently learned that kids are into \u201cjuuling\u201d. Hell, I\u2019d rather them start with that then smokes. I smoked for 22 years and certainly have done some damage. But yeah, maybe give it a shot. 
p298
aVI know that's not what you want to hear but you really shouldn't do that, you may get addicted to them before you even realize. If you eant to smoke that m\u0131ch, I say vape some nicotine-free liquid or if addiction isn't a problem for you, get some Juuls.
p299
aVJuul is pretty fantastic - I also like real Snus from Sweden.
p300
aVGeneral sold in the US isn't strong enough to help smokers quit. Try and find Jakobbson's, its got more nicotine. Get a juul. Or wait a couple months they're releasing thunder strong snus in the US
p301
aVwhere the hell do i get my juul now are you serious
p302
aVjuul's are considered vapes and vape juice right? in Canada we banned flavoured tobacco but you can still get flavoured juul pods and such
p303
aVYea i already got a couple of pallets of extra Juul and more on the way.  Thank god for Juul.  I love her songs
p304
aVI hated nicotine gum, never tried the patches or losenges, iqos or juuls. For me it became easy when I got a good sub ohm atomizer that produces decent clouds a good mod that can run at least 50 watts, and some good eliquid that I didnt mind the taste of. I'm not bothering with those other things, I can switch from cigs to e-cigs pretty easily. 
p305
aVnot really, at least I know i\u2019m over it. fulfilling the craving isn\u2019t worth the taste of a cigarette. I will probably just get another juul or sourin or whatever to fulfill the craving next time. 
p306
aVWhen I went to the store to buy this pack of reds earlier I noticed as I was walking out some girls ~16-17 get out of a sleek white SUV acting all nervous. One had a pack of Juul pods in her hand. Clearly they were going into the same store I was just in (they NEVER ID). So I hung in my car to see if they\u2019d be able to purchase some more. I angled my rear view mirror to watch them. They walked out a minute or two later with mischievous grins on their faces. All of a sudden I felt strong resentment towards these privileged rich girls who think they\u2019re being all bad. Then a tide of self hatred flowed over me when I realized I\u2019m pretty much the same but my habit is WAY more self destructive. Oh well... C\u2019est la vie. 
p307
aVI get the feel-good every time but only get the big rush from the first one in the morning.  Juul ecigs or a big mouth full of dip will knock me down though!
p308
aVWell first off Americam Spirits are some of the strongest cigs on the market (they are my daily cig and personal favorite) also since ur only smoking every once in a while compared to daily with the juul ur tolerance is always low. I went months without any buzz at all with american spirits but last week i switched to the american spirts lights which have less nic and my tolerance lowered. Now that i got a pack of the stronger blues they kick my ass! 
p309
aVAh that makes sense I guess. Wouldn't I still have a high tolerance though? I smoked my juul a ton, like I said almost a pod a day, yet a day after I sold it and got the light blue american spirits I got a rush. \u000a\u000aThey're definitely great though, full tobacco. My only complaint is the cost ($13 for one pack plus a lighter in california) however for the current time it's cheaper than $27 for a pack of pods 
p310
aVYeah. My stomach still feels funny, which is kinda a shame since this is the only pack I ever plan on buying before going back to the Juul
p311
aVCheck out nicotine content in one cig and juul "sesion". Also carbon monoxide and tar might change how it feels.
p312
aVI get a bigger buzz on my juul than cigs.  I do like the way a real cigarette is like a timed period to myself.
p313
aVI've tried to quit many times with regular sub ohm vapes (because honestly I've been vaping longer than I've been smoking, it was a gateway drug) but I always go back to smoking. Freebase nicotine just doesn't do it.\u000a\u000aBut juul is great. It's only been about a week since I finished my last cigarette but I haven't had any cravings at all. 
p314
aVYeah the juul is great, I had a cig the other day and wasn\u2019t as close to heaven as I remember 
p315
aVI\u2019m waiting for Juul to come to European countries. Really want to test it out!
p316
aVCongratulations, I used to be a half pack a day smoker for nearly a year... just got a juul last Wednesday, nearly a week smoke free!
p317
aVGood luck man. I have been able to stay smoke free since I switched to the Juul(except for 3 cigs) in November. I still check out this sub every day because I I still like tobacco culture.
p318
aVWhen I had my first cig after about a month on the juul it tasted like the first cigarette I had ever smoked, that's a taste I'll never forget 
p319
aVSame ive been vaping nic salts out of a kangertech evod fir a while and swear up and down that its better than a juul, sourin, drop, any if that shit, and soo much cheaper
p320
aVI myself am at over two weeks since my last cigarette thanks to the Juul. 
p321
aVis there a distinct difference between the juul and other e-cigarette / vapes that makes it a better, more tolerable alternative?
p322
aVThats happening to a lot people because of vaping and JUULing. I have some friends that never smoked but had there juul or vape run out at a party or at the bar, they then bum a cig and then slowly become cigarette smokers. Or they get tired of paying the insane price for JUUL pods and switch to cigs.\u000a\u000aThats why I never recommend people to vape if they dont already smoke or use snuff
p323
aVJUULs give the closet feeling of smoking as a vape. I've only heard good things about IQOS too. But Nat Shermans are the cleanest tasting cigs out there imo
p324
aVWhat are IQOS? And then juuls are what Id want instead of a WTA liquid, vape wise? 
p325
aVIqos are heat not burn tobacco sticks. Juuls are nicotine salt. Not sure what wta is
p326
aVStop smoking. Similar thing happened  a year or so back to me and now I smoke maybe once a week. I dont get the tightness, cough, or heavy chest, plus cigs are more satisfying and taste better. My juul has tided me over since 2016, and I can also juul in bars without looking like an ass 
p327
aVi mean like idk how u would feel about this but like vaping is easier to get away wit, i got a juul with 50 nic untill i can move out of my parents 
p328
aVI like the idea of the JUUL. But my concern is that the nicotine pod is like 50mg of Nicotine. I feel like I'd become way more addicted to Nicotine smoking on of those and coming off would be a bitch with withdrawals. You could taper down though.
p329
aV&gt;I can't imagine these people developing nicotine addictions and not eventually desiring something stronger\u000a\u000aFunnily enough, (ex-smoker) I switched to the Juul from smoking, and the nicotine I get out of that thing is a lot stronger than any rush I ever got out of smoking. Don't underestimate those things, they're packed with nicotine.\u000a\u000aWith that said, I feel like smoking definitely grew in popularity around me over the last few years, but the rise of e-cigs over the past year (namely the Juul) took a fair chunk out of that. 
p330
aVHey! There are some non nicotine juul compatible pods here [https://cyclonepods.com/](https://cyclonepods.com/). You may be interested in something like that. Check it out! 
p331
aVI was gonna suggest juul but the charging situation
p332
aVYea... I have a Juul right now, I love the thing, but I can't count on any charging station being available for an ecig when an entire battalion needs to charge their phones  :(
p333
aVNice i love newport 100s my absolute favorite!\u000a\u000aAlthough i switched to juul (10/10) i still love a good square
p334
aVNewport 100s and juul cucumber 
p335
aVIt was market tested in countries that don't have readily available ecigs like the US does. It was very popular in Japan, for example, where e-liquids are banned from containing nicotine. \u000a\u000aSo the heat-not-burn IQOS and British American tobacco Glo, and Japan Tobacco Ploom Tech are very appealing options. I don't think they will be such big hits in the US and any region that has things like JUUL
p336
aVTypical Juul Pod user
p337
aVJuuls are the bane of my existence.

aVcan I get any other e cigarette instead of juul? 
p340
aVOther vapes didn't work for me, they might for you. I just recommend the juul because it feels the closest to smoking than any other vape.
p341
aVHey, hope you still get notifications for this post. Get a pod-style e-cig, they're made for "salt" ejuices. Salt ejuice has salt nicotine instead of regular freebase nicotine and you can have a lot more nicotine without it tasting like shit, it's pretty much the same as the kind of nicotine in cigarettes so that's what the juul uses. \u000a\u000aSo you could get a juul or something like the Aspire breeze or the Smok infinix, the breeze and infinix are refillable and you just buy salt juice and fill them up. a lot better than the juul in the long run. Trust me, after 3 months of not smoking any salt juice above like 30mg nic will do you fine if you like the flavour and its a lot more like cigs than regular vape.\u000a\u000aOnly thing is salt juices kinda suck in regular sub ohm vape tanks, pod systems are pretty much designed for them. \u000a\u000aLet me know if you need any other info but quitting smoking for a few days is never a problem for me because of these pod systems, so they can probably hit your cravings pretty well 
p342
aVMaybe I will get juul, but I don't want to replace cigarettes with e-cigs which contains nicotine. Btw thank you for your recommendation
p343
aVI guess you didn\u2019t like the juul!
p344
aVQuit a little over two weeks ago (switched to a Juul), here's a collage of cig photos I found on my phone, ending with my last pack and then the Juul
p345
aVHow would you describe the juul and coffee combo ? I\u2019ve been looking to buy a juul soon and one thing I\u2019ll miss from smoking dearly is coffee and cigarettes haha .
p346
aVI'll be honest, the first day was absolute hell. It wasn't that the Juul didn't work with coffee or anything, it's just that there certain cigs in my daily life that I looked for every day, like the cig on my way home at the end of the day when I'm relaxing and forgetting about the day.\u000a\u000aI've *quit* (with no intention of long-term quitting) in the past three times, once for a week (which I don't really count), once for about two weeks, and once for just over a month. All of them were hell in the first week, and the cravings didn't stop there, albeit the addiction ending. I specifically remember on my month stretch I actually dreamt about cigs and woke up.\u000a\u000aWith the Juul, it was different. It only took a day for me to get used to it, it was simply a matter of keeping everything the same but switching one factor for another (I still take *Juul breaks* if that makes sense), which proved to me even more that it was more about the habit of it than anything.\u000a\u000aA little over a week into switching, I got in a big fight with a relative and went and bought a loosie. For the first time in my life, a cigarette actually made me nauseous. It tasted disgusting, I actually gurgled with mouthwash. I think that's because, regular quitting makes you crave the habit so much that you don't care about the taste, or you build it up in your head, whereas the Juul just substitutes the habit, and plays on your other tastebuds that you never used with cigs, what with all flavors and whatnot.\u000a\u000aA week and a half into it, I don't even think about cigarettes like that anymore. To me, it's just part of the past. I see a cigarette and I just acknowledge it is a cigarette, compared to seeing a cigarette and wanting to smoke a cigarette like in my past quits. Eventually, I found myself actually looking *forward* to Juul, kind of like how I used to look forward to smoking, like after waking up, after a meal, etc... Now I wake up and I don't think *I want a cig.* I just think *I want to Juul*. \u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000aI just realized I went on a bigger *rant* than I meant, hahaha. Anyway, regarding your actual question, I think it works pretty well, I do it every morning, but surprisingly I found myself Juuling with tea, it works even better. Not all flavors work with coffee though; I found classic menthol, mint, and all the fruity flavors (with one exception) to be bleghh with coffee. But surprisingly, Mango works **really** well, so does tobacco flavor of course. 
p347
aVI appreciate the kind words. It's a bittersweet return. Good to be back in the community, and good to smoke again, but on the down side - I'm smoking again. I juul'ed so much it was not saving me money and cigarettes are 10x better than any vape.
p348
aVI went thru a lot of Juul pods, and the battery doesn't last a full day. Cigarettes are in a pack, a lighter is in my pocket, no assembly required. 
p349
aVGood luck man\u000a\u000aI got really irritated and hit my juul
p350
aVThat was my deal, smoke occasionally but switched to juul. Poof anxiety fuck it.
p351
aVI feel you! It's like five minutes of just peace and quiet with nothing to distract me. However your health is important! I would switch to a juul or sourin. It's not the same, but it's close enough. If it made you feel better maybe only smoke cigarettes on the weekend and on the weekdays juul? The guilt sometimes makes me feel worse about myself so that's how I deal with it.
p352
aVThanks. I found a good ol faithful KOOL FK pack still sealed under my bed. Smoked one, and then another... and mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm I cant juul anymore! Threw out the pack and I've been craving like mad since Thurs, going to buy a pack tomorrow.
p353
aVMe buying juul pods vs anything else
p354
aVGood luck! Try a juul man.\u000a\u000aAnd thank you for this subs service &lt;3\u000a\u000aOr april fools
p355
aVlook for juice made with nicotine salts, those are smoother and usually have higher nic content. they're made mostly for juuls or other similar vapes like the suorin air/drop
p356
aVYeah but I did cut back a lot. Since I started vaping it went from a pack and a half a day to a pack every 4-5 days. Btw not the huge robocock vapes I have a juul and a suorin air with salt nicotine juice.
p357
aVI bought the Juul Vape been smoking it off cigarettes for 4 1/5 yrs
p358
aVJuul vs Cigarettes
p359
aVJuul are for kids. Real man smoke cigarettes 
p360
aVI used the Juul the quit. It feels very close to smoking which is why it works for me, unlike the normal fog machine vapes.
p361
aVGood! I love my Juul its a good thing to have. Idk why people in this subject are acting like its for pussies. I still smoke but my Juul is good for indoors, you can do it anywhere and you won't bother anyone
p362
aVHey to be honest you should try the aspire breeze because you can try different salt nicotine rather then the same boring juul salt nicotine plus it will be cheaper. To buy a salt nicotine bottle rather then 4 pack of juul.
p363
aVYah I'm in the process of getting a sourin air rn bc Juul pods are overpriced and refilling them is annoying
p364
aVI'm like a pack a day smoker and I switched to the juul 3 days ago. I haven't touched a cigarette yet and I'm coughing up all the tar from cigs and it makes you feel worse, but I know it's a good thing. I read a study that vaping a juul is 99 percent safer than cigs, so regardless switching helps. You're not inhaling plant material and rat poison, so that's a start. It will be much easier to quit than cigs most likely too. Go to circle K, they have the cheapest prices. I got the starter pack for 40 bucks
p365
aVIsn\u2019t juul a vape tho juul just more sleeker looking 
p366
aVI'm not buying the story, vacation, not able to leave the hotel alone. Then how do you get away with smoking/vaping? Seems like a story a kid would use to get cigarettes or a juul. 
p367
aVI was a pack a day and i quit by trying the blu because i had heard of it and it looks like a cigarette. now i use a juul. \u000a\u000aDefiantly an improvement for anyone thinking they might want to quit at somepoint.\u000a\u000aMaybe not today but someday.\u000a\u000aI really loved smoking. Its just something to remember if that day comes you want to find something else. 
p368
aVA Juul-like device would be my first recommendation for someone going from cigs to vape.
p369
aVWhat would you describe as the similarities and differences, between any of the more basic vapes you find at gas stations(including the Juul) vs. a tank style vape? And are there any significant differences vs. say something like a Blu, vs. a Juul? Thought both of the latter 2 were similar, but just was wondering myself. I've suspected I should probably do a tank style vape if I ever went to vaping, but just want to be aware of the similarities and differences between those type of vapes.
p370
aVA vape with a mod and tank will have more options in terms of nicotine content and flavors, but they don\u2019t have the same feeling of a cig in terms of throat hit and nicotine rush.  A Juul has an extremely satisfying throat hit and nicotine rush, especially the mint flavored pods. But the flavors themselves aren\u2019t that great.  I don\u2019t know about blus.\u000a\u000aIf you\u2019re trying to quit smoking Juuls are by far the best option IMO
p371
aVA similar option to the Aspire Breeze, and what I use every day, is the Suorin Drop. It's stupid easy to charge and refill, you buy refillable "pods" to plug into the battery and just hit it like a cigarette. Similar to the Juul which is popular as far as the gas station stuff goes, but you're not locked down to a small handful of flavors.\u000a\u000aIt's all about finding what works for you, vaping can be a full blown hobby or it can just be something that takes five minutes of maintenance a day.
p372
aVThat's unfortunate because I tried a juul and found it to be pretty weak as far as smoke "feeling" goes. I was thinking a traditional tank setup would be stronger. 
p373
aVVery true that options are far greater with a tank. Vape shops are everywhere and the flavors and combinations that you can make are pretty much endless. Plus a good mod has a lot of customizable features so you can make your vape experience just right for you. \u000a\u000aThroat feel is all dependent on the juice and tank. Years ago when the Blu style e-cigarettes started coming out, I tried them, and it was not for me. About two years ago I got a box and a tank, and haven't looked back. Higher nicotine content = harsher throat feel. If you get a juice with 0mg juice, then you're not gonna feel it. If you get one with 12mg or more, it could be harsh. As for the tank, the better the airflow and coil, the better your hit will be. \u000a\u000aIf you go with a dripper, you're going to get hits more satisfying than any other device out there. \u000a\u000aThe other thing is cost. Juul pod packs aren't going to last as long as bottle of vape juice. So, their business model is to get you to spend more on their proprietary technology. \u000a
p374
aVJuuls were just a nice middle ground for me between cigarettes and full mods, now I have a smok alien and it\u2019s fantastic, it was just hard to get my head around my nicotine fix not being the shape and weight of a cigarette.
p375
aVIf anyone is interested i am a really big fan of the Suorin products. They Suorin Air and Drop are both very small, and use nicotine salt e-juice, which can be as high as 50mg. In my opinion they are both better than the Juul, as they can be refilled with your own juice. 
p376
aVOne thing I\u2019d like to mention about the throat hit thing is that in my opinion the Juul/other nic salt vapes is that it hits like your throat like a cigarette. It seems obvious but imo throat hit in normal tank vapes is just painful and makes me feel like I have a sore throat. Then again I also smoke menthols so that may be why. 
p377
aVI recommend not going with the Juul and going with the smok rolo badge. It takes nicotine salts and juices and has a very satisfying throat hit and it\u2019s much higher quality 
p378
aVThanks for the response. My gut feeling is that I should investigate several vape shops and ask about tank style vapes at some point, but I might just try a Juul for now and see what it's like. Can understand, if you've never tried Blu though.
p379
aVI'll have to google what the Smok Alien is. I'll guess it is some sort of customizable tank style vape? Anyway, I appreciate you mentioning Juul, and will give it a try eventually to see what I think.
p380
aVTbh man ove been smoking since 14\u000a\u000aBought a juul today honestly recommend it's simple easy to use and strong\u000a\u000aOr a vape
p381
aVJuul are vapes.
p382
aVeveryone in my friend group was a hardcore smoker, and all of a sudden 2 of them got juuls and one of them got a vape. reckon they all still smoke but no where near as much. vaping helped me quit for a year but I honestly like smoking so I started back up 6 months ago. though I do love the accessibility of a juul, since you can do if virtually anywhere, but that lead to me being even more addicted and almost dependent on nicotine
p383
aVGet a juul. Flavors are different but it hits hard like a red. 
p384
aVcop a juul or other vape. it's not worth it
p385
aVDon\u2019t smoke in the morning and get a juul or snus. The juul will give you that throat hit and super satisfying buzz. Snus will give you a nice mellow buzz that\u2019s lasts. And not smoking in the mornings helps to break the cycle 
p386
aVI'm around the same age as you but I started in my teens. Just speaking from experience very few people can stay in the light smoker/once in a while smoker population. I thought I could do it but here I am around a pack a day. If you're really worried about your health and addiction j would suggest not doing it or maybe try using a juul to limit health risks. But then again who am I to tell you what to do. Stay lit lmao 
p387
aVYes, of course, plain packaging might deter nonsmokers from smoking but it has more to do with culture than anything. Look at Austria for example. They have packs with graphic warnings and yet people amoke inside restaurants and their highschools have smoking sections. They have Tabak Trafik, a chain store specifically for tobacco. That's because cigarettes are very socially accepted there and plain packaging won't stop that. They care more about the experience than possible consequences of smoking.\u000a\u000aAmerica on the other hand has literally the most beautiful pack designs but only one fifth of the population smoke. That's because of the heavy anti tobacco propaganda featuring people with holes in their throat and black lungs. Also, many people use an e-cigarettes and Juul. That basically means USA doesn't really have a smoking culture. They don't care about the feeling of a cigarette but only how they can get lung cancer from that. They're very materialistic when it comes to tobacco.\u000a\u000aIf I wanted to stop smoking in my country, I'd focus heavily on propaganda and brain washing, not pack designs.\u000a\u000aThat's my opinion about this particular subject.
p388
aVYea, ever since my friend gave me a juul i've cut back quite a bit. I smoked mainly turkish blends and flavored cigs 
p389
aVBro honestly of your gonna be paranoid and worried 24/7 or everytime you smoke what is the point? No need to put yourself through he'll just to smoke. Try Juul or phix they have good flavors and have a good nicotine hit. At least it's better than smoking. \u000a\u000a*just as a side note I stopped smoking 28 days ago. I never really get addicted to anything Tbh. Like I even tried herion one time... Hated it and never looked back ( over 10 years ago). I feel great rn I can fully breathe and workout again like I used to. When I get the urge to smoke I just use my juul and then go on with my day
p390
aVNo u just don't know how to read. If I'm bored and have nothing to do i just smoke a lil on my juul 
p391
aVThat's a pretty stupid and kind of assholeish thing to do just a prove a point. One, you might end up getting addicted and then you have to deal with trying to quit. Two, picking up smoking with the intent of proving to someone trapped in an addiction how "easy" it is to quit is really just rubbing their face in while you don't seem to understand what you're getting yourself into. \u000a\u000aWhat you should do is tell your friend to buy a Juul. I was a smoker for many years and  when I started to have breathing problems I picked up a Juul and I quit smoking overnight. It feels very similar to smoking a cigarette, unlike normal vapes. My lungs are recovering and I can breathe better and over all my health has improved. Many other smokers have been able to quit with the Juul, pass this information onto your friend.
p392
aVVaping does seem to be much healthier than smoking, and that's why it's taking over now that the social norm has become "smoking is gross and it'll kill you". I'm only mad at the fact that instead of just educating the populace on the dangers of smoking, the FDA did everything in their power to destroy the entire market. And as a Juul owner with a casual interest in vaping I'm afraid they'll do the same thing to that.
p393
aVha just quit smoking daily and picked up a juul. where did u get this pack? 
p394
aVI was a pack a day of Marlboro Menthol or Newport Reds (noticably stronger than Marlboro Reds), smoking since 14 years old.\u000a\u000a Recently quit (2 weeks+ ago) as an adult after unconsciously weaning my intake down until just a few puffs of a Juul was enough. 
p395
aVthe way the nicotine is delivered via a JUUL is noticeably more effective too, as a salt vs freebase in standard analogs
p396
aVLooks like its time for you to get a juul!
p397
aVWhere do you live? I'm in the Seattle area and part of the reason I quit was because I was sick of going out in the fucking cold in pajamas to smoke when I could just get a sweet nic buzz inside with a Juul.
p398
aVHaha it never be raining where I'm at. Maybe a few times a month. But I like smoking outside. Juuls are huge because of their convenience though. To each their own I guess
p399
aVGet her a Juul.  They are made to feel like a cigarette going down and one pod is equal to one pack a cigarettes in terms of nicotine.
p400
aVget a juul. it uses nicotine salts instead of the stuff in normal ejuice and the buzz and throat hit feels the same as a cigarette. got me to quit over night.
p401
aVIt\u2019s a smoking *supplement*, not a replacement. That\u2019s the main difference between the Camel snus and the likes of General and other swedish Snus.\u000a\u000aI love them personally, with those and Juul i\u2019m almost a week without cigarettes on my journey to quit.\u000a\u000aI love the Mellow variety, they\u2019re sweet like Camel cigarettes but not overwhelmingly so. Frost isn\u2019t bad either but don\u2019t get the large portions.
p402
aVim with you man. the juul is a lifesaver. 
p403
aVjust stop smoking cigs! I feel you, bro, I smoke too but if you are legitimately scared it could be for a good reason. I would honestly just recommend smoking a Juul, pax, Jax, Vuse, phix, or blu. or invest in a nice rechargeable mod. Go see a doctor tho because you could also have an anxiety issue that's undiagnosed. Pinpoint as to why you smoke this is a huge part of cigarette dependency! Are you smoking to escape something? Idk man you do you but figure out your situation 
p404
aVI recommend the juul, can\u2019t praise it enough.
p405
aVHey man I quit a couple months ago with a Juul, it's easier than you think. Of course now my ass is poor because of Juul pods lol but I love lifting weights and being active, and the cigs finally caught up to me. I'd recommend that if you find any trouble quitting down the road though. Good luck.
p406
aVI've been smoke free for 4 years and it was a bitch and a half to quit. You feel that you can live without smoking now but just wait until you are out at some social gathering and everyone is smoking. That's when you will be really tested, the only piece of advice I can give you is to go to a gas station or online and buy a juul E cigarette and only take a puff when you are having a nic fit (5.0% strength nicotine so it will knock you out lol). Since it was only a few years though I think you will be able to quit pretty easily. I did a pack a day+ for 7 years but I also started when I was 14. Sorry for the rant, just trying to help, smoking really fucked me up and I wish I never started but I don't bash on people who smoke. Good luck
p407
aVAlready have a Juul, and I literally have zero friends who are smokers.\u000a\u000aThe Juul at 5.0% is pretty weak imo, I can breathe it like air all day
p408
aVAlready have the Juul, I was dual using. It's kinda weak. But I need to get in shape - thanks for the advice!
p409
aVill hit the juul in bed thats about it.
p410
aVtry a juul.
p411
aVIt's indescribable. They potentiate each other, something with the nicotine allowing more dopamine to be released at once with the adderall. I smoked maybe 8 cigs within 3 hours on adderall. If i have weed on hand, I normally smoke through my stash on addy. I used to finish juul pods within an hour on ritalin 
p412
aVA whole Juul pod in an hour is wild
p413
aVI know a few friends who\u2019ve had success using Vapes, go for something like a Juul or Bo with a high Nicotine juice to get started. They\u2019re one of the closest vapes to a real cigarette in my opinion
p414
aVI can smoke at my job with no real issue, but sometimes I puff on the Juul in between cigarettes. I'd try oral tobacco if you are at a desk, etc like dip or snus. \u000a\u000aI used to be a dipper and can say that a good pinch of dip is several cigarettes worth of nicotine at once.
p415
aVInvest in a juul. I pretty much quit smoking in less than a week with it. I\u2019ll have a cigarette once in awhile but not on a daily basis anymore
p416
aVIf that all fails then honestly don't fuck with cigs its not all that its cracked up 2 be for some people. If you are just tryna do it for that nic then just buy some Nicorete it is much more effective and could be more cost effective aswell. If your really into the smoking aspect then just get a juul, phix, or sorain air. 
p417
aVBought A Juul
p418
aVYou said u tried the flavors but only mention tobacco, also the tobacco flavor is not a burnt tobacco flavor like the one your used to tasting in cigarettes. It has a nice mtl hit with the feeling of a cigarette. For smokers who want to smoke indoors dont shy away from the juul, it really is an amazing device, asside from the price gauging here in california.
p419
aVTwo weeks ago that was my attitude, but i bought a Juul and at first i just cut back my smoking a lot, but now cigarettes just leave my mouth tasting like an ashtray. it\u2019s been a day and a half since i had one, i really don\u2019t know if i even want to finish my pack now. Shits really weird lol
p420
aVJuul is really great for anyone looking to cut back
p421
aVSo i\u2019ve noticed, I absolutely love this little thing. I\u2019ve had big box mods with drip systems and they don\u2019t come close to the satisfaction the juul gives me.
p422
aVJuul was designed as a smoking replacement. It delivers the "buzz " in a similar way that cigs do, plus the nic salts give a nice throat hit
p423
aVSame situation for me, I used to love cigarettes. I would smoke a pack a night and go drinking with my friends. The more we drank the more packs we\u2019d buy. I slowly stopped hanging with my friends but the smoking habit stayed. I didn\u2019t mind at all because I still liked to smoke. But then I started to smoke more weed and decided it would be best to drop one of the two. So I picked to drop cigarettes because they kill people. Seriously if you could see your own lungs instead of a picture of someone\u2019s black lungs, you would want to quit immediately, because you\u2019re seeing your own lungs and you\u2019d be scared. Just had to emphasize that because people don\u2019t, and won\u2019t ever take it seriously. However I\u2019m 19 so my shit will HEAL. I know it will. Anyway I got the JUUL and I haven\u2019t smoked in months it\u2019s great. If you schedule out your backwoods and your JUUL pods you can really satisfy your smoking needs in a day. I smoke my woods after 6 pm and use the JUUL throughout the day. Straight backwoods and bud after 6pm tho. 
p424
aVBecause the two are completely different smoking experiences with totally different aspects and combinations of how the flavor can actually be experiences.\u000a\u000aFor example, most people who smoke a cig, and then vape - if they got the same amount of nicotine on each, would be more satisfied with a cigarette.\u000a\u000a\u000aJUUL is ok, but vape sucks.
p425
aVGot really stoned and took a few bars and I couldn't resist. Didn't taste great but man did it feel nice to smoke again. But it's just this one cigarette. I'm going right back to my juul after and from then on out.
p426
aVDragging on my Juul right now actually!
p427
aVI\u2019m glad i could help, I can\u2019t even begin to tell you how much i love mine. I used to have a huge fucking fog machine of a vape as well and my Juul is so much better
p428
aVI love smoking and i love trying new brands, but i\u2019m cutting back with the help of my Juul. Do i ever plan to quit? Yeah someday, but i\u2019m only 20, i have plenty of time. I\u2019m just gonna enjoy it and gradually cut back until it\u2019s my time to quit.
p429
aVHope you quit dude, if you\u2019re having trouble you should try a Juul, it\u2019s a really good lil vape that feels almost like a cigarette. Good luck!
p430
aVMan I smoked a half pack a day every day last year but in Late November I bought a JUUL.  It helped so much dealing with those early cravings when you first quit.  Now I rarely use the JUUL.  In fact last night I was very drunk and a friend handed me a cig. I lit it up took one puff and just the smell and taste was awful and I put it out. Stay strong but if you ever do pick up the habit again remember this advice. 
p431
aVTry a Juul my guy, it's the only thing that worked for me
p432
a.
