aVJuuls, along with Phix's, Juno's all hit much differently than a traditional vape. A lot of people dont like the way a vape hits. But Juuls specifically hit a lot like a cigarrette. Juno's hit like  something between a vape and a cig. But these devices all have a MUCH higher nicotine content. Theyre great for people trying to quit smoking.

aVIn my area, we have a couple of guys that sell pods like that. $20 for a Juul one and $30 for a phix since it holds more.
