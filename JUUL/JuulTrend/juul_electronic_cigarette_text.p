VJuul by PAX is the only cigalike I would recommend.
p1
aVWhy the Juul is a vaper's second best friend.
p2
aVSo... Why not just get a tiny ego with a protank mini and save a shitload of money? Since u r saying that Juul is shittier than even a basic setup
p3
aVSo I know you pointed out first thing you're not affiliated, but reading this reminds me of a line from Jimmy on this season of South Park:\u000a\u000a"... does [he] know [he's] an ad?"\u000a\u000aIt's well enough written but there are other options for stealth setups out there that cost less and provide more variety.  Juul is pretty overpriced IMHO especially when factoring in the cartridges.
p4
aVJuul has been coming here lately.
p5
aVI'd buy this if I ever needed a stealth vape, but I'd probably just buy a T18 or T22 for the customization between flavors and price difference.\u000a\u000aPAX will rise in its ranks using the JUUL platform though if OP says it works well. I disagree with the 50mg standard, but it is what it is.
p6
aVGo post this in /r/juul and keep it there. 
p7
aVHow stealthy do you need seriously? \u000a\u000aThis ain't small enough? http://www.visioncig.com/vision-ego-spinner-battery-variable-voltage-650mah-p-19.html\u000a\u000aPop a protank mini on it and call it a day. Save a crap load also, just because you can afford a Juul doesn't make it a smart purchase...
p8
aVI'm never buying anything that involves some type of proprietary system.  Although JUUL may work for you, I can get the same result from a protank mini/ego battery - at less than 1/3 the price.
p9
aVfunny you posted this because I'm seeing a bunch of the big players on instagram with Juuls lately.  like people that have all of the newest and coolest gear and juice, and all of a sudden they have a juul on their page.  pretty crazy....  it's too easy to assume that PAX just paid them to post it.  i actually believe it's good for what it does, and that's stealth vaping.
p10
aVI actually like the juul. I just don't like their recent attack on this sub and other forums.
p11
aVI haven't seen many other juul posts. Again, this is just my opinion and I'm not getting anything out of it. I'm just high as fuck and happy I don't have to stand outside in the rain to get my vape on when I'm three drinks in.
p12
aVDid you misread when I put in OP that this is my second job? You're kinda weird on your stalking while missing the entire context of your argument. My first job is at a law firm where I can't be chucking tits all over. So I use my juul and then take my mod during my lunch and maybe once or twice throughout the workday. It stays in my pocket at the vape shop.
p13
aVI'm not a juul rep though. I literally just bought there product and can vouch for it myself. Would you be saying that if I wrote an ancedote about the Archon I'm in CCI's pockets? Doubt it.
p14
aVExcept you can't provide an anecdote where it isn't harmless. Have you been next to a person vaping on a juul? If not I can't see how you can actually state this. 
p15
aVI didn't say it harmed others physically. I stated that it is rude and ill mannered. I have been near others vaping on cigalikes in indoor public spaces where it was not allowed. Not sure if juul or not because they were always stealth vaping. 
p16
aVThis makes me an apostate in here, but I've almost completely given up on my iStick/Nautilus in favor of just using juuls with disposable cartridges. It's smaller, looks a thousand times cooler, I like the flavors a lot, and is just easier to deal with. My only complaint is that I can't just refill a cartridge for it. I don't want to carry a lightsaber sized thing with me, I don't want to drip, I don't want gigantic hits. Am I alone? \u000a\u000aEdit: since this post isn't totally relevant to OP, I'll add: these are getting to be wildly popular in NYC, and I wouldn't be surprised if there is a major sea change towards small efficient setups on one end (that aren't trying to look like a cigarette) with your big box mod group on the other. Decent vaping with small devices is still a largely untapped market when you consider how shitty most of the big players are. 
p17
aVI can relate. I've come close to smoking again for the same reasons. I love vaping, but it can be a huge hassle. \u000a\u000aI carry a Juul with me everywhere now and mostly use my "real" vape gear when I'm at home. It's a helluva great nicotine delivery system. Convenient, dead easy, long lasting, and the nicotine is strong enough to kill a craving with 3 or 4 hits. I smoked 2 packs a day for more than 35 years, so that's no small feat. \u000a\u000aIt's also tiny, unobtrusive and great for stealth vaping. Looks like a little USB drive, I use it at my desk and no one notices. Might be worth a try. 
p18
aVI would recommend buying something like a JUUL instead. 
p19
aVUsed Juul cartridges -- anyone want to sell me some?
p20
aVPax Labs get's patent on it's nicotine salt e-liquid formulation found in its e-cigarette, JUUL
p21
aVJUUL has it's fans. I can't say I've never heard of it, but I also can't say I ever intend to try it. This is written like an ad though. It probably is one.
p22
aVIs there a real difference between salts and extracted nicotine when the JUUL uses 5% nicotine by weight?\u000a\u000aThat question might be mangled, but I'm really asking about the science between the two.
p23
aVI use the Juul for traveling and for going out to non-vape friendly bars - basically most places here in CA.  The nicotine punch is quite strong, especially for someone who has been off analogs and vaping 3mg for over 3 years.   The upside of this is that for smokers looking to quit combustion, the nicotine kick is more in line with what they are used to and may help with the success % - which is still quite low (below 25%) for smokers looking to switch over. 
p24
aVI use my JUUL a lot, especially when I'm out and about. I'm a huge fan of it. No hassle, good flavors for when I'm craving something potent. Cartridges are a bit expensive, but they last a long time for me. I would recommend it as a good first thing to try for those trying to quit cigarettes.
p25
aVThis is a good thing IMHO. I actually have a JUUL and it's the only cig-a-like I've tried that is effective. It's light, portable, doesn't create insane clouds, delivers your fix and can even be "lipped" similar to  traditional cigarette. Hell, the battery life even holds when chain vaping for the most part (better than any other). \u000a\u000aHopefully they get grandfathered under the new FDA regs (if they don't fix the regs in the mean time) so I still have a glimmer of hope for staying away from tobacco. 
p26
aVI burn through about 1/3 - 1/2 of a carto on mine daily. It helps the cravings a ton and it definitely hits you faster than a typical vape. \u000a\u000aI think I'm at 3-5mL of normal e-liquid now and before getting the JUUL I was at about 7-10mL. 
p27
aVThis may seem like an odd suggestion but [the juul](https://www.juulvapor.com/) works surprisingly well for people that want a low maintenance device. You can pick them up at gas stations for cheaper than online, too. They've got a decent amount of airflow for mouth to lung inhales and each pod lasts about as long as a pack of cigarettes would.
p28
aVDoes the JUUL by Pax include incurable lung cancer?
p29
aVLiterally has been posted over a dozen times in the last 48 hours... I think we are aware...\u000a\u000aAnd no idea on the Juul, ask the new /r/juul
p30
aVA subreddit for juul
p31
aVJuul lyfe! That's another one of the moderators/friend in the group chat. He's a cool guy send him a what's up!!
p32
aVI was vaping Fins before they started redesigning into semi-open systems.\u000a\u000aNothing against Juul, though I'd mess around with one if I found it in a store just to see the hype. I don't want to buy it online nor do I want to go to a head shop if they're sold there. Nothing against head shops either; I don't fit the culture, as much as I align with their sole purposes.
p33
aVA big draw of the juul and the sole reason for many (myself included) is the aesthetic of the juul. I think it's a truly unique product in that sense and as such deserves its own sub. 
p34
aVMy problem with Juul is the advertising. They are going straight at the teenage demographic, period.
p35
aVYou dedicate a sub reddit to just one product that isn't even innovative.  That's hella lame bruh. That product is lame and is in no way satisfactory.  The reason Noone talks about the juul here because it doesn't help get you off cigarettes. Did I mention it's pretty lame too. I guess I can't fault you on your enthusiasm on a product you love, but by saying so many times that you do not work for them, it kinda makes me think you work for them. So good luck on you and your friends circle jerk.
p36
aVI know 5+ people that couldn't get off cigs until the juul
p37
aVjuuls ruul, you druul
p38
aVGood for them man I never said they couldn't.  My only point is there are 100s of great products out there that can customize a user's experience. Then we have the juul, which is just another closed system cigalike. This thing is lame and you want to talk about it on r/electronic_cigarette. Nobody cares man. Down vote me all you want. I am just being real with you. 
p39
aVYou literally said "The reason no one talks about the juul here is because it doesn't help you get off cigarettes" and then proceeded to push your opinion to be a fact. 
p40
aVBy the way for someone who doesn't say they work for juul, your reddit accounts first post is only a week old. Did you just create a reddit username just to talk about juul? Kind of suspicious. 
p41
aVNo, we don't want to talk about it on r/electronic_cigarettes, we want to talk about it on r/juul and give people who want to talk about it a sub to talk about it and make it so that the subscribers to ecigs don't need to hear anymore about a product they clearly don't like. It's beneficial to you. This just makes it so that people who search juul on this sub will find this and good to the right place
p42
aVDude get out of here. There's nothing to talk about on your subreddit. Oh god which one of the 5 shifty flavors do you like? So interesting, right? I know you work for them anyways. Most the time when someone realizes that there are actually good vapor products out there they drop that bullshit juul in the trash where it belongs. But once again good luck to you. I just wanted to tell you about your shitpost and why nobody really cares about YOUR product. Sorry reddit didn't work in your favor.
p43
aVI'd like to join.  I've been an "advanced vaper" since 2012, and I LOVE my Juul.  Part of what I hate about vaping is some of the attitudes in the community.  I'll be sharing from a vapers prospective what I love so much about these little devices.  
p44
aVJuul 
p45
aVThis seems like a pretty big paid for commercial by innokin. No?\u000a\u000a\u000aPS. Juul for life\u000a
p46
aVIt definitely goes to this if his review is as accurate as they usually are or the JUUL for this years best stop smoking device 
p47
aVI've been using mine exclusively for about a month. I love it and I think it's a step in the right direction for form v function. My everyday carry has become the NEbox and the Juul. Mmm. The future.\u000a\u000aMy only gripe are the sketchy threads. Specifically, the battery door threads are atrocious and feel soft. The tank threads aren't perfect either, but they work most of the time.\u000a\u000aThe plastic tank is whatever. I would have preferred something replaceable and glass, but it works none-the-less.
p48
aVSo how's the JUUL? Looks pretty nest for a small device and I know the PAX are very high quality. 
p49
aVIf you're looking to quit, it may be worthwhile checking out some MTL setups. The Juul, iCare, and MyJet, for example, or go more old-school with a nautilus mini which fits on any 510 mod and uses less wattage. \u000a\u000aPart of the current trend in juices is much higher VG than used in MTL juices, as it produces more vapour. VG has an inherent sweet taste, and has a tendency to mute other flavours a little (which isn't a problem when you're blowing huge clouds). MTL juices give you a chance to cut back on the VG, and with the much better tobacco juices out there these days you may be able to have a closer approximation to what you're looking for. 
p50
aVThe 7qq pens can work,  but there are much better things for the price.  If they happen to have a juul at the 711 though,  that would work great. \u000a\u000aLook up eleaf icare,  joyetech ego aio,  and innokin endura.  Watch some youtube videos on them.  \u000a\u000aI honestly wish the devices i listed were around when I started.   Goid luck! 
p51
aVif you can find it, the pax juul is a good one. unfortunately, many of them are manufactured by large tobacco companies (markten, blu, vuse) and don't work for shit. my pet theory is that they're intentionally terrible so that people continue smoking lol\u000a\u000a
p52
aVTry the Juul by pax. I've gotten several friends off of analogs with the Juul
p53
aVinnokin endura t18 is more of a pen but it's very similar. joyetech aio is also pen style but much smaller. if you want a cigalike type experience try the eleaf icare. that one has an autodraw where you just inhale and it goes. for all of those you will need to purchase liquid and spare coils. if that's too much trouble and you don't mind spending the money, the pax juul is like a very good cigalike experience. really top notch. it's a pod based system so you will have to purchase liquid cartridges but a lot of convenience stores stock them and they have a store locator on the website. again, a bit pricier but less hassle. vapecrawler.com let's you find good prices and for the juul you will have to visit their site. 
p54
aVYes, the gas station vapes are notorious for being extremely low quality, and not being satisfying enough to quit smoking.  The only current vape that you can pick up in a gas station that I would recommend, and most other vapors, would be the JUUL.
p55
aVIt is going to be hard getting answers in this thread at this time, because of the overwhelming amount of people in here right now, but subscribe to the sub, we will get you straightened out for sure.  Until then, you could start reviewing the JUUL and the Innokin Endura T18.  The JUUL is getting pretty decent ratings by people trying to quit smoking, and the Endura is a tried and true vape, that imitates the draw of a cigarette fairly well.\u000a\u000aThose are the two I would start with looking into, and reviewing, and they are both affordable.  As far as the juice goes, between 12mg nic to 18mg nic for the average smoker is sufficient in starting out if she is to go with a device that allows you to choose your own juice.\u000a\u000aIn closing, although the two devices I recommended do not have a removable battery, if you where to look into any device with a removable battery, be absolutely sure that you and your wife are aware of battery safety.
p56
aVI would also like to add to what catchthemagicdragon said.  The mod that he suggested, I also would recommend to an extent.  It is a subohm, and certain people will prefer a vape that is more akin to smoking a traditional cigarette.  I personally needed a subohm to quit because they are far more powerful, but I seem to be outnumbered with new vapers that preffered the non subohm.\u000a\u000aThe Innokin Endura T18 is a very affordable pen style vape that replicates the style of smoking a cigarette much more than a subohm does, it has the tighter draw like a cigarette, and is good for mouth to lung inhaling.  Also I know that a lot of people are giving the JUUL very good reviews, and actually can be had in a gas station, although not to much is known yet about its new nicotine delivery (It uses nicotine salts).\u000a\u000aAgain those are just other options.  If you do go the other route, or get any vape that has an external battery, please do yourself and the entire vaping community a favor, and look into battery safety to ensure you keep yourself safe.  The batteries are safe when used and handled properly, but you do not want to ever throw them in your pocket, short them out, etc.. 
p57
aVBest advice I can give to someone switching, especially heavy smokers, is pick up a Juul. It's so damn close in draw to a cigarette, and has a similar throat hit and form factor. 
p58
aVJuul
p59
aVJuul . . . empty out the pods and refill with [Mr. Salt-E liquid](https://gaslightvapor.com/collections/e-liquids/mr-salt-e-liquids)
p60
aVJuul 
p61
aVMy parents, who know NOTHING about vaping, found my Juul and freaked out, and took it away.
p62
aVAsk for it back , as long as you're of legal smoking age , and paid for it with your own money they can't really say anything. And if you do get it back , hide it better. Especially if its a juul.
p63
aVOh wow... I didn't expect that.   My post about you being on reddit was kind of a far cry I felt.   But so many vendors are on reddit nowadays so I figured I'd ask. \u000a\u000aSo many are vouching for you, I feel confident you'll make it right.   If I had a bunch more pods or something or pods for my Juul It wouldn't be such an inconvenience but I timed it so I'd get this bottle just in time to refill some my von erl pods and was just very disappointed when i opened the box.   \u000a\u000aDon't think this will be my last order from you either.   If a company messes up at all, and makes it right, I always come back.   Good customer service is something I REALLY want in a shop or vendor.   So I really appreciate the quick reply.   Did you get the email with the pictures? \u000a\u000aThat way you'll know which Scott I'm talking about and which order exactly I got and which he might have gotten.   \u000a\u000aThank you for the reply VC! 
p64
aVconcerns about JUUL E-Liquid
p65
aVJuul - where is it REALLY manufactured?
p66
aVI think it's a safe bet that the JUUL is made in China.  The only "part" that is probably made in the US is the e-liquid in the pods themselves.  It's still a good vape I think, I certainly haven't had any issues with mine.  
p67
aVI do like it a lot so far, I just overspeculate about profit margins. Pax 2 is confirmed manufactured in China, so it's likely. It's annoying that they word it like this and no where do they come out and say where Juul is manufactured. Surprised it's not required to state.
p68
aVIt's very Apple-like by stating that it's *designed* in California but foregoing any mention of where it's made.\u000a\u000aI wish I had the income to justify buying only US-made goods. The Juul is inexpensive and well made which is all I really care about currently.
p69
aVI do about the same. My Endura T22 is my desktop and my Juul is my laptop.
p70
aVI want to get my girlfriend into vaping, she's currently using a Juul to stop smoking analogs and this would be the next step. Thanks of the opportunity.
p71
aVHow to quick fix Pax Juul not working on draw
p72
aVI can't believe this isn't discussed more. I absolutely love the juul when it works but it's just so inconsistent it infuriates me. The first hit off a fresh pod is amazing then it's mostly downhill from there. I have to take out the pod and reinsert to get a decent draw after that. Also, when a pod is less than halfway, no matter what you do it won't be as strong as the first draw. I've been on the phone with PAX and have gotten replacements but they all are the same or worse. \u000a\u000aIt's such a love hate relationship with this thing.
p73
aVDo you need your original receipt to get a replacement? I bought my juul about a week ago and I don't have my receipt anymore \U0001f612. It charges but it won't hit. 
p74
aVOMG I just resuscitated 3 juuls from my graveyard using this trick! Thank you!!!!
p75
aVThis definitely helps a lot of the time, but occasionally it won't work. There is clearly an issue with their manufacturing process. It doesn't happen all the time, but I'd say I get at least one messed up pod every 1 to 3 packs of 4. That's still unacceptable.\u000a\u000aWhat makes it even more annoying is the fact that their once-excellent customer service just ignores my complaints about the pods (not sure if this is the case with anyone else). Surely they're getting a lot of these complaints, so they must know there is a serious problem.\u000a\u000aI originally thought it was an issue with my battery (which I'd been using for around a year); after all, we're talking about a $30 device (or however much it costs). However, after buying a new battery, I've since had the same problem, which tells me it is definitely the pods.\u000a\u000aHopefully they get this issue fixed. The device is getting more and more popular, and when that happens to products, they can sometimes become lower quality for a number of reasons. I just hope that isn't what's happening with Juul, which is my go-to for when I'm out and about and don't want to be carrying around a bigger set-up.
p76
aVholy shit, i was sitting here getting frustrated at my new juul pods and i did that and now i am happy. My addiction can continue. I applaud you.
p77
aVI have had the problem with the weak juul hits if you cover the top of the pod with your fingers  (the clear plastic part) it creates a tighter seal and makes the hits as strong as a fresh juul pod hit\u000a\u000aHappy juuling!
p78
aVConvert juul to dry herb
p79
aVcheck out /r/vaporents for suggestions for the dry herb vapes you are looking for. However given how the juul works and how tiny the battery is on it, I don't think you'll be able to convert it to the purpose you're trying to achieve.
p80
aVNot sure what juul is but you could try modifying an atomizer to work like mflb.  \u000a\u000aE: I think ~~/r/entgineers~~ /r/stonerengineering has mflb builds 
p81
aVI'm really digging my Endura T22 with some 45mg Mr Salt-E nicotine salt liquid. It's my primary device with the Juul as my other device. The Juul is a better experience but the Endura T22 is much cheaper to refill than the Juul.\u000a\u000aLook into nicotine salt liquids. I think the standard freebase liquids suck if your focus is a satisfying nicotine experience. Freebase is also harsher.
p82
aVThe closest I've come is the Juul in that it has serious throat hit and a few hits feel like the first cigarette of the morning, or at least my best memory of.\u000a\u000aI also use an iCare with nic salt juice (from Bombies and Mr. Salt-E) and it does the trick without being quite as harsh as the Juul.
p83
aV100% agree. The Juul is amazing. 
p84
aVAgreed.  \u000a\u000aI have almost quit using mods in favor of the Juul.  I will probably use it even more when I get some flavors other than tobacco.  I will also look into getting some of the MrSalt-E since I have an icare in the mail that will be here tomorrow.
p85
aVTry a Mr Salt-E, high-nic salt juice. I'm loving the 45mg Fruit &amp; Menthol juice in my Endura T22 (which is supposed to be pretty similar to your AIO).\u000a\u000aThe **best** like an analogue ecig is the Juul though. No comparison. Nic salts rock. The Juul tobacco flavor is unexpectedly good too.
p86
aVI'm thinking something similar. I got my mom a Juul for Christmas and she has a bunch of 18mg sitting around, and I just got a RX Mini that might look pretty awesome with a Nautilus. The bartenders at my local bar have said they're cool with us vaping, but with my RDA setup I always feel uncomfortable vaping inside anyway.
p87
aVNautilus on anything. Seconded. I have 1.8 Ohm could running like 12-14 watts. It hits just like a cigarette. The Juul is neat and all, but if you already have a mod you should try a Nautilus or Nautilus mini.
p88
aVThanks! Have you tried the Juul that some other folks in this thread are recommending?\u000a\u000aAlso I'm guessing you use Nicotine Salts to boost the mg/ml level of the Arrakis? What's the advantage of doing this vs. vaping a 30 mg/ml juice?
p89
aVI've used the myjet, juul, and von erl and the Juul is the closest.   
p90
aVI tried the Juul, and I did enjoy it. It was a great little device, and it performed very well. However, the juice selection is quite limited, and I wasn't impressed by any of the flavors that I tried. Granted, the Juul pods are very easy to hack and refill, but they are also much more expensive.
p91
aVThats awsome, my parents both accually started using e ciggerettes before me, the von erls, i try to get them to try out my smok alien and avocado, or with a cleito rta, but it always makes them cough lol, and when i hit their von erls, which is similar to a juul i think, the damn things make me cough. lmao
p92
aVi think juul is good for long time smokers,, maybe..
p93
aVPlease people, don't go suggesting fucking noisy crickets and what not to new people. Suggest the eleaf icares, the juul, things of that nature to people just starting and wanting to quit smoking.
p94
aVHey there, There is a world of Vaping out there! I have been an advocate myself for a time now. YES! There are 'no' and 'low' nicotine vaporizers and e-juice. You being lost is absolutely alright there's a lot of different stuff to learn. From the read, your looking for some type of 'mouth-to-lung' vaporizer maybe? They have a more cigarette feel, less cloud and often more flavor.  Look into the juul possibly? Though, a lot of mouth to lungh have higher nic for quitting smoking. The hardest part is that everyone has their own taste and likes, and really describing the vape and what you want/need from it can be challenging. \u000a\u000aALSO! I recommend looking into #grimmgreen on YouTube. he does reviews and product description how-to's and all the cool stuff between.\u000a
p95
aV&gt;[**Juul vs Myjet vs iCare BEST Review EVER! [29:54]**](http://youtu.be/3hiL4UaWOrw)\u000a\u000a&gt;&gt;We reviewed all three of the popular electronic cigarettes on the market right now.

Enjoy the review! \u000a\u000a&gt; [*^Smith ^&amp; ^Atomic ^eCigs*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0cEp1vekMFC9RVd3ASvcUA) ^in ^Entertainment\u000a\u000a&gt;*^71,506 ^views ^since ^Sep ^2016*\u000a\u000a[^bot ^info](/r/youtubefactsbot/wiki/index)
p96
aVThere are literally A TON of devices on the market right now that would suit your needs. Most people here would recommend you something like the Juul, My Von Erl, and Eleaf iCare for starter kits.\u000a\u000aAs you get familiarized with the world of vaping, you might find yourself experimenting with different setups, but that would be a topic for another day. \u000a\u000aPersonally, I'd get the Eleaf iCare. It's simple to use, small like a lighter, and you can try the nicotine salt based juices which would give you that satisfying head rush. 
p97
aVThe Ednura T18 and T22 kits are great for beginners. I wouldnt recommend the juul though. \u000a\u000a\u000aBesides that I can't really help you man. How old are you? You shouldn't have to hide the fact that you vape from your parents
p98
aVWhy not the JUUL 
p99
aVYeah I tried to quit several times (cold turkey) but always found myself going back etc. Once I started vaping I never went back, early on I had a few ciggs here and there while drinking but that stopped soon enough as well. Now I just bring out my JUUL when I'm having some drinks. 
p100
aVYou could go with the Juul ecig. It's compact like a cigalike, and it looks fairly easy to use. 
p101
aVJuul is your best bet. I use one myself and vape is extremely satisfying, especially for a recent smoker.
p102
aVThe problem with the Juul that everyone keeps recommending is that it's expensive as fuck for what it is. I'd say go with the eleaf icare. Cheap as dirt online or from the local shop. Cheap coils. Super compact. Not the same shape as a cig but you can hold it and hit it the same way.
p103
aVJuul
p104
aVJuul is special because they use a nicotine salt rather than a nicotine freebase.\u000a\u000aI'm currently using a Juul and an Endura T22 with some Mr Salt-E 45mg juice and I'm really enjoying it. The feel is similar but Mr Salt-E is smoother (which I honestly don't prefer...).\u000a\u000aThe only other company I know of that is using salts in their juice is Bombies.\u000a\u000a
p105
aVI refill my Juul pods using Mr Salt-E 45mg. Justeliquid.com has a sale going on. "holidays" for 20% off. \u000a\u000aI've mastered taking apart Juul pods without tools. 
p106
aVYou'd need someone that has used the JUUL and also recommend you a specific (style) of tank and VG/PG ratio along with the nic levels. PG increases throat hit. Bigger coils create more vapor and may need to be heated at too high of a wattage for what you want despite closing the air flow. I have no experience with the JUUL, but I assume it's a mouth to lung vape.\u000a\u000aIf I had to guess blindly, 12 mg nic with 50/50 VG/PG ratio. Most of my co-workers who switched from cigarettes started here. Most stuck here too. They have mouth to lung tanks too so restricted air flow and not much vapor. I too started here. I never liked the throat hit feeling though, but could stand 12 mg with 50/50. Even if not, I think it's a good place to start because if it's too much or too little, you don't have many more options on either side. Nic changes throat hit and head rush, more PG increases throat hit (harshness varies from person to person). I believe I'm PG sensitive.
p107
aVEither the Endura kit or one of the nextgen cigalikes like the Juul or Von Erl then. If it's just a straight case of replication at this stage, probably the Juul.
p108
aVGet yourself a decent starter kit, a charger, batteries, some juice, some extra coils for whichever atomizer you buy, do it now or before the Holiday Sales are over. Maybe an Ego AIO starter kit, Endura T22, Alien, istick Pico. Or possibly a Juul if your looking for more of a cig alike 
p109
aVJuul.
p110
aVNot for a my von erl \u000a\u000aShe smokes full strength somethings, nearing two packs a day.   24mg will be fine. \u000a\u000a24mg in some shitty Chinese regulated mod with a tfv8 on it is a different story  \u000a\u000aYou do know that the juul pods are filled with 50 something mg juice right? \u000a\u000aI buy bottles of 100mg/ml pg solution to mix with vg or juice for my Juul.   Maybe you don't understand these pod systems but 24mg will be just fine.   If not I'll buy her 18mg because the 24mg will be fine for me 
p111
aVJuul uses nicotine salt solution, so that 50mg is deceptive.
p112
aVI have the Von Earl, Cync, and Juul (thanks /u/so_sic_of_it) and I would like the von earl best if it wasn't for the spit back (they are actually for my wife).  I wouldn't even call it spit back, I would call it leak back.  Its not a little spit, but I get a pool of juice in my mouth 1/10 of the time.  The flavor is better than the others, but the throat hit on the Juul is better IMO.  If I could get rid of the spit back, I would buy another for me and drop my mod full time.
p113
aVAnd like I said, I order nic salts for my Juul to refill the pods  \u000a\u000aI'm vaping a von erl with 18mg bird brains right now.   Trust me she can handle 24.  And if not, I'll buy her 18.  Simple as that 
p114
aVI love my juul and picked up a Von Erl and Myjet because of it.  Gotta say, I really like the von erl too.  The pods are really easy to refill too.
p115
aVHow does it compare to the juul?  \u000aI have been using my juul now more than my 200w mod.  \u000aThe juul pods (at least tobacco) are perfect but the price sucks.
p116
aVIt'll be replacing my Juul... Well, I'll still use the juul but I love the MVE.   Got one for myself and this bird brains is killer.   Even the tobacco that came with the kit is good.   Better than the juul tobacco for sure imo.   I love the feel (I actually like the rectangle juul but it's a tad uncomfortable) love the finish, love the draw.. Love the amount of vapor (it IS more than the juul so if you don't want more vapor stick with the juul) and the BIGGEST improvement is the charging.   Micro USB.   Not the shitty way the juul charges.   Mines already all fucked up.   \u000a\u000aUsing micro USB is the way to go for sure.   
p117
aVI recently got the MVE and have some bottom leakage and mouth spitback issues. Did yours really never have an issue? I've noticed that some pods perform better than others but it's very inconsistent here in QC, Canada (Von Erl subcontracts their production to the country where they sell, i'm assuming it's to facilitate border issues).  \u000a  \u000aAlso, I have 1 pod (out of about 12) that gave me quite a few dry hits. The others just spit juice in my mouth if I pull to hard or frequently.  \u000a  \u000aWhat issues have you found with the Juul? I've been considering getting one even though the unit and the pods are a pain to get in this country. So far the MVE, even though I enjoy it, has left me on my hunger.
p118
aVAbsolutely zero issues with the MVE definitely no spitting or leaking a brand new pod might gurgle a little but you aren't supposed to suck on these things like they're rdas... You're supposed to pull on them softly.   I've never once had juice actually come in my mouth.. \u000a\u000aAs far as the juul, they've had to replace my actual device 3 or 4 times I'll have to check how many dead ones I have... And the charger once.  The way it charges was a horrible idea and even keeping everything clean after a while of using it it took forever to get it to start charging.   Fiddling with it until it was just perfect and the light came on and started pulsing.   Otherwise the flavor selection sucks ass... The pods are easy to refill though so get some 100mg nic salt pg solution and mix it 50/50 with some juice and refill them cheap.   Just use the mint one for any fruit flavors and it will go away after a bit.  Not so much for some of the.. Heavier flavors that stay around much longer.   Less vapor production... The MVE has treated me perfectly and my sister has no complaints as far as I know.   I make sure to keep the device connections as dry as possible.. Keep in mind I've only had it for 6 weeks... Something might happen but who knows. \u000a\u000aI did get one bad pack of pods that would dry hit so I emailed electric tobacconist and they gave me store credit to buy... More than one pack so shout out to them.  \u000a\u000aI fuckin love the thing tbh.   And Mr fritter is possibly my absolutely favorite morning juice... I don't know why but i always find myself reaching for a pod of it in the morning.   Good stuff. I've only tried the three cuttwood flavors (unicorn milk is way way way better in this than dripped I'll tell you that.   The current formula that is who knows what anymore) but they blow all of what the juul offers out of the water.   I mean just way better and was able to get some 30 something mg space jam for free with that store credit so I'll have two new flavors to try.   Bird brains is still my favorite though easily.   Never had issues with leaking AT ALL since I got it.   Will report back if that changes.   If you're having major issues with it contact whoever you got it from  
p119
aVWhere are you located? I think it might be an issue with the supplier here in Qc, Canada. I don't pull that hard on it and have had this problem with 2 different units and many pods.  \u000a  \u000aI'm waiting on some *Fill my pod* tobacco flavour in 45mg to try in my used MVE pods to try and mimic the Juul.  \u000a  \u000aIt's a shame you had so many issues with the Juul, gotta say it's making me weary of getting it out here considering I'll have a hard time getting them to cover the warranty across the border... \u000a  \u000a
p120
aVJust wanted to let you know, randomly after getting a package Saturday, that space jam actually makes some pretty DAMN good juice for the MVE.   And they go up to iirc 36mg.  It's much more like a juul throat hit.  So fucking satisfying but the flavor is SO much better.   I got the (iirc again, sorry at work) particle Z or X or something like that... It's supposed to be like a Blueberry cotton candy I think, and it's fucking DELICIOUS.   And tbh I was surprised.  I got Andromeda which is Blueberry and pomegranate and its also quite good.   \u000a\u000aRight now I took a pod of this cotton candy space jam with me to work and it is just delicious.   I used to LOVE space jam back in the day... Like when they started pretty much.   That far back. Astro was SO Good back then... But man, after they had to change some stuff it was never the same.   I never got a bottle that tasted like it used to.   But these two flavors I give two huge thumbs up.   I don't know if the mixes or ratios are different at all... But man I was surprised.   I bought them for the hell of it just to expand past cuttwood.   Mr fritter is my morning vape every morning.   I just LOVE it in the AM.   Then something lighter and fruitier the rest of the day...   Then I'll use some 18mg at night and take a puff or two every time I wake up to pee or whatever.   \u000a\u000a\u000aI'll definitely be buying more of this particle whatever (cotton candy) in 36mg.  Love love love the throat hit mixed with great flavor.   
p121
aVOnly the custard - if you want something that *doesnt* mask the nic taste go for that - it's a nice enough custard flavor but it doesn't have enough about it to even try to mask the nicotine. I'm at 1.5mg tho, so I've pretty much grown unaccustomed to its taste. As far as effect goes, two little girl hits of the 25mg from a Juul and my head was swimming. 
p122
aVthe juul or the von erl are suppost to be good stealth vape pen like devices
p123
aVLeaving the country in a couple months - bringing a Juul and an iCare with some 18mg juice
p124
aVYou cannot go wrong with the Juul, but it is not a do-it-all device so you'll likely need another.
p125
aVUnfortunately I cannot find a Juul e-cig on any Indian stores. \u000a\u000aWhat do you think about [this](https://www.litejoy.co.in/combos/monte-carlo-18650-variable-voltage-advanced-personal-vaporiser-complete-kit)?
p126
aVSo, I don't know much about these vapes such as the JUUL and this? I'm assuming its a really small hit? Does it still have a throat hit at all? I'm interested in possibly getting one.
p127
aVHow popular is Juul in your area?
p128
aVI have never seen anybody with a Juul in my area. 
p129
aVI\u2019m starting to pick up on a trend around the JUUL specifically. [There\u2019s even a (pretty funny, IMO) song about it](https://soundcloud.com/bennettc/julio). \u000a\u000aIf what\u2019s happening at ASU is also going on in other places, I\u2019m happy. Well, mixed, really. On one hand, this helps cement the viability of it. One of my fears is that the JUUL fails in the marketplace and I\u2019m out of pods. Seeing this trendiness makes me feel more secure about the long-term success of Pax and of JUUL specifically.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, I don\u2019t want to see it become a lightening rod for \u201cOMG-a-new-generation-of-addicts!\u201d when the most prevalent device on high school campuses turns out to be the JUUL. 
p130
aVAccording to Juul the closest place to Tulsa Ok, which is a pretty fair sized metro, is 60 miles away.  So would say unpopular in our area.  Had to order one from the company for my wife.
p131
aVNever see and Juuls here. I hardly see vapes here. Portland, OR smokes like it's the 90's. Weird, because in Seattle, hardly anyone smokes anymore.
p132
aVI didn't see one until I got to college (in New Orleans) where almost everyone I know either has one or smokes out of other people's actively. These are people that didn't smoke cigarettes that just want to rip the Juul for the crazy head rush -- not to mention it's awesome when you're hammered. It's huge at southern colleges, my friend at Univ. of Alabama says that he has one and that almost everyone in his fraternity does to. Juul is on the rise, big time. 
p133
aVJuul types vs others?
p134
aVAn MTL setup with some 45mg Mr Salt-E liquid is pretty fucking amazing. It's nicotine salt like the Juul. A slow, dense inhale from my Endura T22 is quite satisfying. It's smoother than the Juul but you can get a denser (fuller maybe?) throat hit.\u000a\u000aI'm really digging the salt nicotines.
p135
aVJuul &amp; Innokin Endura T22. The Endura is pretty good... the coils seem to die fast, but I've only got a week or two of experience with it.
p136
aVJuul is definitely in their own league as for throat hit and mouth feel. Their nicotine salt metabolizes closer to how tobacco is allegedly metabolized from cigarettes. 
p137
aVThat's what I use. Although I alternate between Juul and iCare. iCare produces more vapor, therefore better flavor than Juul.
p138
aVInconspicuous E-CIG like JUUL but similar flavor to vaping?
p139
aVI'm not that familiar with the Juul but the iCare isn't going to give you the same amount of vapor as a bigger kit (if that's what you mean by vape-like). It's a mouth to lung style kit with minimal airflow and tiny coils. 
p140
aVJust ordered the Juul for my wife.  Have heard many people say they have had great luck with getting others to quit.  Seems to be a quick device that just works without much fiddling.  Juice cartridges seem to be almost as expensive as cigs.\u000a\u000aHopefully if the wife likes it can convince her to move on to a more complicated mod.  If not I have it for quick trips in town or when just need that quick nicotine fix.\u000a\u000aSome have success at refilling the cartridges.
p141
aVThe juul is a great device. Also, any choice you make will only work if you truely want to quit . Good luck.
p142
aVGrab yourself a JUUL, closest thing to what you are looking for. I've heard good things about the Von Erl as well but haven't tried it myself, I do own a JUUL however and it's great for going out etc. 
p143
aVJuul definitely has the best throat hit close to a real smoke, just remember that all the pods from every device has a possibility of leaking and getting juice in your mouth. With the Juul getting juice on the contacts makes it not fire for a while. Haven't had this problem with the Erl yet.\u000a\u000aAlso rebuilding coils for the Erl actually work so you can refill the pods. The Juuls are pretty difficult and the leak factor is worse even with brand new pods.
p144
aVThe [Njoy recharge](https://www.njoy.com/products/recharge-economy-kit/0) is cheap, very cigarette-like and their tobacco flavors are pretty authentic. They taste kind of like un-lit cigarettes if that makes sense.\u000a\u000aDifferent flavors have [different nicotine levels](https://www.njoy.com/faq), so choose accordingly. If you smoke a lot, you'll want to go with the Bold tobacco, if you don't smoke so much, you may like the Gold tobacco better. The Menthol is also very authentic and appropriately disgusting/delicious, depending on your feelings about menthol cigarettes.\u000a\u000aI keep a Recharge kit around as a back up, or for when I want some high-nic. They say one flavor chamber is equal to a pack of cigarettes, and that seems pretty accurate to me. They also come in a really cool, Zippo-style case. I think for traditional cigalikes (not the pod sticks like the Juul, which I haven't tried) they're the best around.\u000a\u000aLast time I checked, the code DISCOUNT30 was good for 30 percent off.\u000a\u000a
p145
aVI like the look of these better than the JUUL.\u000a\u000aAre e-cigs better for me? (my lungs)
p146
aVThey're definitely more cigarette like than the Juul, aesthetically. I haven't tried the Juul, but I can vouch for the Njoy Recharge. \u000a\u000aBetter than smoking? Definitely less harmful. You can pick up a Recharge kit for about $10.50 with the discount code, so nothing to lose by trying it out. You'll eventually want to upgrade from there, but the point now is to get you off cigs, so just start seeing what works!
p147
aVI still don't own a "proper" mod (just a Juul &amp; Endura T22). I'd like to return the Dripbox 160 &amp; Arctic sub-ohm tank to my friend who let me borrow it.\u000a\u000aThanks OP!
p148
aVOr pick up a Juul
p149
aVAdvice on a setup for someone trying to quit the JUUL
p150
aVHave you considered the eleaf icare? Much better device that he Juul , imo, but still small and pocket friendly. Not super advanced and refills easy. 
p151
aVWhat you are looking for is the sbody elfin dna75. I am a juul user myself and alternate between the juul and the sbody with various 22mm tanks attached, using 6mg to 9mg ejuice. Lately I prefer the pico-s RTA. 
p152
aVJuul and the Von Erl for me.  I've found them to be quite enjoyable with the new nicotine salt juices available.  \u000a\u000aAlso a big fan of the kanger protank 4 on an IP5.  That's been my daily driver for a while.  \u000a\u000aSquatchberry by Yetivape is a nice juice.  
p153
aVIt's a salt nicotine (like the Juul) so it's much smoother than the standard freebase nicotine.
p154
aVDoes he want to try vaping?    \u000a\u000aIs he interested in quitting?    \u000a\u000aIf he wants to use vaping as a means to stop smoking then you can consider getting him something.   \u000a\u000aFor a two pack a day smoker , I would buy them two JUUL kits and wish them the best.
p155
aVJuul is they way to go. Upgrade later if he gets into vaping.
p156
aVMy old father, wasn't a fan of the Juul and up until about a month ago was still rocking Ego batteries with Nautilus Mini's. His favorite tank is without a doubt the Nautilus Mini, as for mods, he still likes his Vision Spinners (easier for him to pack while traveling) and this little Eleaf 20/40 watt box. For some reason, both of my parents can't stand the nicotine salts, which is no problem for me so I inherited both of their Juul's \u005co/ Most vape shops in the Chicago area here have Juul's for you to try, so find one of those &amp; let him try it. If he likes it, yeah like everyone said, Juul. If he doesn't, and isn't a pot smoker, Nautilus Mini or 2 and an Ego or 2, or a small Eleaf box. 
p157
aVYeah unfortunately I have 0 time to diy these days, and if/when I do have time, I'd honestly rather spend it doing something that I don't do 9+hrs a day every day anyways haha. I've put out over 27k orders myself, mixing and bottling every single bottle and it sure does get tiring. With regulations the way they are at the moment, it's just not worth my time at the moment either. Also, I originally started diy as a cheaper alternative to store juice, which I then got super submersed into the hobby, then got convinced to turn it into a business (thanks everyone who convinced me). All of this was really to 100% quit smoking cigs, I was definitely hooked on the cigs (up to 3pad smoker before I started vaping) and it had to stop. Vaping helped me completely quit smoking (2.5yrs 100% tobacco free going strong) and I plan on quitting vaping sometime in the near future. I can quit vaping at the moment with no problems, I've stopped for days on end with no heavy cravings or anything. I honestly just enjoy it and it sure does help with the amount of stress I deal with on a day to day basis. \u000a\u000a\u000aAnyways, back on topic lol. I totally know what you mean, I'm definitely a ton more sensitive to nic now compared to back when I was vaping higher nic. I just purchased several juuls for friends and family who I haven't been successful getting off smoking with open tank devices. I tried one of them out after I gifted it to a friend and surprisingly the nicotine wasn't irritating constricting feeling like higher nic (6+mg) normal eliquid is for me. I did get one hell of a buzz of a single hit, but the nic wasn't near as bad as I expected it to be. \u000a\u000aMaybe pick up a myjet or something and give some juice with nic salts a try? Maybe get some mr salt eliquid in 25mg and see how it helps out. Or you could go the cheaper route and try out 1mg or 1.5mg and see how you do with it. I usually vape 0.5mg, but vape on 3mg every once in a while just for that extra kick. I haven't experienced going up to 3mg every once in a while making me want to vape any more or making me feel more addicted. As long as I just use it whenever I feel necessary it doesn't really make much of a difference for me personally. Sorry for the text wall haha
p158
aVHonestly, abstinence stresses me out. My objective is not to never smoke a cigarette, but to never be *addicted* to cigs again. I've probably had 15 cigs in the past 4 or 5 years.\u000a\u000aI've been using my Endura T22 with some 45mg Mr Salt-E Fruit &amp; Menthol lately and it **really** good from a "like a cig" perspective. The Juul is good too.
p159
aVYes. Haven't smoked in 3+ years and every now and then the old addiction will be like "hey fucker remember me?"  Pick up a device like a Juul for such times.
p160
aVSometimes setups like that can be intimidating!  Have you considered an iCare or a Juul?  Ease them in to it!
p161
aVI agree with the comment above. When I first became interested in ecigs, I used GreenSmoke cigalikes for a while, as it felt like analogs. I then was introduced to vaping. But the first time I saw a box mod, I was adamant that I did not want one as it did not look/feel like cigs (to me). I eventually got an eLeaf iStick PICO 75w kit, and it eased me into the world of vaping. I'm now looking to purchase my 3rd mod and each one gets bigger and more powerful than the last. There are so many new devices on the market now, like the eLeaf iCare Mini (as mentioned above), or the JUUL, and others. These might be a good stepping stone for your cuz.
p162
aVI'm curious what part of India will you be in? \u000a\u000aA Juul, icare or another compact equivalent might be a better idea to bring along.  
p163
aVThe ones that imitate the aesthetics of a cigarette are no good. If she doesn't mind a simple look, check out the Eleaf iCare, JUUL, or myJet.
p164
aVHave a look at juices made with nicotine salts - they're typically used for pod refills for the likes of the Juul - Mr Salt do a 25 and a 50mg, Bombies...I can't remember, and Cloud Alchemist do their stuff in 30mg format which *might* be doable in a Nautilus if you're careful.
p165
aVFirst thing to keep in mind - a hit on your vape does not equal a drag on a cig. The way nicotine hits the brain is vastly different when you are breathing in medicated air vs. combustion.  The MVP is a dated mod, but still pretty stable. The Aspire Nautilus was a great tank for its age....2-3 years ago! That's like using a Pentium I computer today. Things have changed dramatically in the industry since then, I would urge you to consider a new tank. I won't give my opinions on that, since I am a vape shop owner and subject to subjectivity. Also, don't be afraid of taking a lot of vapes to make up for the different in nicotine delivery. A hundred hits off your atomizer is still better than a handful of hits from the cigarette. I would try salt-based nicotine, they have been hugely successful lately and offer 45mg nicotine strength, without the need for a large and cumbersome device. They don't even feel harsh on the throat. Nicotine delivery via 45mg natural salts is better than 24mg regular e-juice, although there is no science currently to back that up. People have been using the JUUL with great success, and JUUL uses nicotine salts. 
p166
aVGet yourself a Juul for work is probably easiest 
p167
aVYou could go the juul route. My gf loves hers. Idk if you want something like that, but it's as compact as you can get
p168
aVIf you do go this route, the MyJet is a pain in the ass. Stick with Juul or some of the newer ones. 
p169
aVPax makes a fairly sleek looking e cig called the "Juul". It doesn't look like most traditional vapes. It's small and easy to use. It takes refillable pods. It uses a highly concentrated nicotine e liquid that uses nicotine salts instead of traditional e liquid nicotine. The liquid in the Juul pods gives it much more of a smoking experience.
p170
aVGet the juul, made by same company as the pax. It's a great option for people that don't like the vape pen or box mod aesthetics really. 
p171
aVThe juul is also made by the pax. It looks like the "apple" of vapes. Very nice and very beginner friendly.
p172
aVJuul
p173
aVuhm... juul\u000a\u000abut I'm gonna let someone else chime in, I'd suggest there's an alternative because it's 2016 and perhaps get him something different for christmas..
p174
aVJuul is still so valid here. It's so easy and no hassle tech wise. Would be a great place to start. 
p175
aVI first learned of this when researching the Juul. They use nic salts.\u000a\u000aThe only eliquid I know of that uses salts is Mr Salt-E. You could always buy 0mg eliquid and add the nic salts yourself. Nude Nicotine sells nic salts.
p176
aVI've really gotta try Bombies. Very cool that they have a salt option.\u000a\u000aand yeah... I dunno about sub-ohming nic salts. I'd like to try it though. According to Juul's literature, even their super-special nic salt eliquid is still slightly slower at getting into the bloodstream than actual cigarettes, so nic salts shouldn't be any more dangerous to the heart than the nic rush cigs offer. Of course, it's good to be cautious...
p177
aVThe coil on your vaporfi tank is probably burnt out, that is why it isn't working.   \u000a\u000aReliable draw activated devices are compared in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/50w59e/the_juul_icare_and_myjet_thoughts_on_each_device/?ref=search_posts).  \u000a\u000aI like the juul but that is the only one I have tried out of those three.   \u000a\u000aWe just got the icare in my shop I work at and it seems a little complicated to fill and change coils but a nice design in general .   
p178
aVTarkin likes Juul so much he put pods on his uniform
p179
aVI cant vouch for this personally, but reviewers I trust recommend https://www.juulvapor.com/shop-juul these. The throat hit is very cigarette-like and vapor is close to a sub ohm device while retaining a more cig-a-like form factor. It's at least worth considering\u000a\u000aP.s. It may also help to know that when I first started switching to e-cigs, it took quite a long time to stop smoking tobacco alongside them. Sometimes after I used the e-cig I would be like "well that was nice...I could really go for a cigarette now". So dont expect a hard-switch right away, is what I'm saying. As one's lungs adjust to the vapor it makes e-cigs more attractive and tobacco less, but it takes time and usage
p180
aVI know you already have aa device, but a Juul by Pax mimics a cigarette nicely.  High nic content, and their tobacco taste "cigarette-y".\u000a\u000aYou can also buy juice now to refill them.
p181
aVMost of your 1+ ohming is being done in things like the juul, von erl, myjet, and icare these days. Definitely a small minority of people building their own 1+ ohm coils.
p182
aVIMO what got me off of cigs and into vaping was my purchase of a JUUL. Hands down.
p183
aVIt's no problem and you're welcome! A [JUUL](https://www.juulvapor.com) is a cig-alike that's, in my opinion, the most pleasant one out there. The flavors are nice, the amount of vapor produced is perfect, and you feel like you're inhaling something without having a harsh bitter throat experience. Like I said, it helped me and I was really iffy about the whole "vape" thing and if it would actually work with me. Because of the JUUL, it did. Since then, I've graduated to bigger more complicated things like mech mods, building, blah blah blah, but it was definitely a factor in my whole journey out of smoking cigarettes.
p184
aVI believe the cartridges are meant to die. Try looking into the juul it has pods that are refillable and some companies are selling the nicotine salt liquids to refill with
p185
aVI don't want to invest tons of money into vaping nor do I want it to become a hobby. I just want a **convenient and simple** setup that offers tons of nicotine with some flavor, so I've got an Endura T22 and a Juul.\u000a\u000aOver-sized, expensive mods aren't for everyone. I've tried my friend's ~~IPV4~~ IPV5 with high-end tanks and it's not what **I** want. You've got to respect that there are more perspectives than your own...
p186
aVI have had the MyVonErl for about a month now and that part about the liquid getting in your mouth is possible from every device. Usually its at the start if the pod is too cold and you take a tight draw the coil doesnt heat up enough to vaporize the liquid. Happens with the Juul also.\u000a\u000aThe coils can be rebuilt pretty easily using 32ga kanthal and anything over 18mg nic gives a pretty nice hit. One trick that I found is that if you cut the tabs for the top of the pod it makes it easier to slide off. Before I take a draw I just take off the top and see if there is any liquid sitting at the top that may have leaked over. Havent had any liquid in my mouth in about 2 weeks since doing that. Best of luck.
p187
aVHave a look at the new generation of cigalikes - the Juul/Von Erl/myjet/Icare - someone did a direct comparison review of them over the last couple of days - maybe /u/so_sic_of_it, but I wouldn't swear to it. Search 'juul' and sort by new and you should pick it up.
p188
aVThanks, is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/50w59e/the_juul_icare_and_myjet_thoughts_on_each_device/) the thread you were mentioning?\u000a\u000aThe Juul sounds kinda nice, though I'm a bit concerned when he says that it is kind of a stealth vape. That makes me think the smoke cloud will be barely visible, which is important to me from a psychological aspect. It also sounds like the cartridges are really expensive.
p189
aVMost of the cartridge-style cigalike devices are going to be more expensive to run than something like an eGo AIO, but they mimic the design/feel of a cigarette pretty well. So if that's something important to you, they're the best options.\u000a\u000aFrom what I've seen about the Juul, calling it a "stealth vape" is because you can blow pretty similar clouds to a cigarette if you want, or you hold it in for 5-10 seconds and absorb all the vapor. They don't mean that you can never get clouds with it, just that if you're in a place where smoking isn't allowed, you can still get away with it.
p190
aVPax Juul. Or the others /u/throwymcsock suggested.
p191
aVThat's the one. Remember when he says 'stealth vape' its compared against the 200w things that blow weather systems that you can get for $50 these days - I've used a Juul briefly and the output's pretty comparable to a fag. The cartridges *are* expensive but there's a few companies come out with high mg nicotine Salt juices to refill them - Bombies, Mr Salt and Cloud Alcehmist are the ones that spring to mind. If we say $20 (roughly) for a 30ml bottle, then Juul pods are 0.7ml each, so that $20 buys you...(can't math)...somewhere about 40 pods worth of refill.
p192
aVIt'll never be chucking big clouds like most of the 18650 mods out there, but if it breaks you off the cigarette ritual, that's a **HUGE** step in the right direction. Breaking the habit of smoking always seems to be more difficult than the actual smoke, so the Juul (or the other cigalikes) could help with that.\u000a\u000aYou can always get a more powerful setup later on. :-)
p193
aVThe Juul is the **best** if you want to feel the vapor in your lungs. Nothing beats it.
p194
aVIt would be a lot cheaper in the long-run to have a tank like that that you fill yourself.\u000a\u000aYou can pick up a 120mL bottle for $20ish, which is the equivalent of almost 200 Juul pods, iirc.\u000a\u000aThe most important thing, though, is if it helps solve your cravings and gets you off the sticks.
p195
aVIt's more about the eliquid itself. I've got some 45mg Mr Salt-E Fruit &amp; Menthol in my Endura T22 and it's good but the Juul is still much better from a "hits like a cigarette" perspective.
p196
aVSounds more like they are getting into the sex toy industry with a name like vibe.   \u000a\u000aI have tried the vuse but not the vibe, my impression was that it worked for getting nicotine but the flavor was terrible, I like the juul a lot more.
p197
aVI agree - Juul is where it's at if you want a convenience store ecig.  I think OP would be pleasantly surprised with an Endura T18 or the like.
p198
aVYeah I bring my JUUL with me when I head out, I couldn't keep it as my daily but it's great for nights out. 
p199
aVThe icare, myjet, or juul are my favorite non hobby, simple, easy to use options. Imsuggest one of those. 
p200
aV I read a post recently by /u/So_sic_of_it where he tested a bunch of the small vapes like the Icare, Juul an others an found he really liked the MyJet vape.\u000a\u000aI might take a look at that one myself too in new year.\u000a\u000aEdit:words\u000a
p201
aVSeriously, the Juul is great. The pods are kinda expensive but the ejuice in them is amazing. It's not really an all day device though. You can get it for like ~$35 (with 25% off) on the official Juul site so it's really a no-brainer. The flavors are good, but they are different from normal vaping flavors... Initially I didn't like the flavors but now I love them.\u000a\u000aI've tried refilling the Juulpods with Mr Salt-E 45mg but it's not as good as the stock ejuice. I have been really enjoying Mr Salt-E in my Endura T22 though.
p202
aVI was looking at the my jet vape as well, it didn't get as good of reviews as the juul.   Here in MA you can't test them in the store, I wish there was a place to go to test different ones, I'll definitely check out that review, thank you
p203
aVJuul? It's not a great device for all day, heavy use but it doesn't put out much vapor and the eliquid is incredible. Even my non-vaping friends think it's awesome.\u000a\u000aAside from that there's a bunch of AIOs &amp; cigalikes that you can find reviews for with a quick Google and YouTube search. None of them are perfect, so that's why I'm mentioning checking the reviews for yourself. They all have their own drawbacks.
p204
aV&gt;Myjet? Anyone have one and like it?\u000a\u000aI still need to stop being lazy and actually type up my review, but last month I tested several of the MTL cigalike devices including the MyJet, JUUL, Cync, iCare, and Von Erl. Out of all of them, the MyJet was my clear winner. Better flavor than anything else I tried, very small and light (only the JUUL was smaller and lighter), relatively inexpensive, and easy to fill/refill. Several friends and family members of mine are getting a MyJet, a pack of pods, and a few bottles of Cloud Alchemist's specialty pod refill juice for Christmas this year.\u000a\u000aThat would be my recommendation for sure.
p205
aVSeconded. You may also choose something like the Endura T18/22, Eleaf iCare, Juul, Wismec MyJet, My Von Erl, and various beginner devices that suit your needs. 
p206
aVI would get a nice cigalike maybe for example the juul has high nicotine and a nice mouth the lungh hit
p207
aVI'm pro-vaping but from a simplicity and nicotine experience perspective, cigarettes win. Yeah, from a flavor perspective, vaping wins but the idea that vaping is better in every way is nonsense.\u000a\u000aJuul has made some progress with their superb nic salt juice but we've got a long way to go before vaping will be better in every way. Until then, many people will continue using cigs even though they know vaping is likely healthier.
p208
aVYeah, for me, the cig craving whilst drinking is probably the worst. The Juul has been incredible in that area though. I still like a cig when camping and/or drinking though.\u000a\u000aCurrently, I think I'm gonna have some low-nic (or no nic?) DTL setup for flavor and a high-nic MTL setup for nicotine.
p209
aVIf your reading this thinking this is the device to finally get you to quit smoking, it's not. Get the Juul. 
p210
aVI don't think anyone in their right mind would try to quit smoking by immediately going for an RTA that does its best work above 100W... nor did I mention it would be a good choice. Plenty of other options like the Juul, the iCare or the Endura to start vaping.
p211
aVNot just to start, but to finish. Juul is the finish line, before quitting altogether.
p212
aVLeaving 2012 and arriving to 2016 would be a start. Go get an AIO, icare, my jet, juul, von erl... something that is present tech will go along way.
p213
aVIt is not realistic to look at synthetic nicotine in relation to the deeming regs in a vacuum, as the scope of the regs expands well past this argument alone.\u000a\u000aFrom what I have read and heard, yes, synthetic nicotine has a high likelihood of being excluded from the regulations as a stand alone product.  However, before everyone goes jumping for joy and sinking their life savings into NextGen Labs stock, you need to look at the other side of the equation - equipment.\u000a\u000aThe deeming regs classify any equipment (mods, tanks, coils, etc) that could feasibly have their intended use be for the vaporization of tobacco products (current e-juice) as a tobacco product.  By this logic, everything that is available on the market today is a tobacco product.\u000a\u000aNow- to circle back around to juice made with synthetic nicotine - even if the product in question does not utilize tobacco in its production, if the intended use pairs up with an existing tobacco product then, by association, this product is also a tobacco product.  \u000a\u000aTo give the logic table for this:  Ejuice contains tobacco and therefore is a tobacco product.  MOD/tank is used in the vaporization of Ejuice, and therefore is also a tobacco product.  Synthetic and 0nic ejuice utilizes MOD/tank (which is a tobacco product), and therefore is ALSO A TOBACCO PRODUCT.\u000a\u000aThe logic circles are senseless, but it is how the FDA interprets their regs.\u000a\u000aHOWEVER, if a closed tank system is made that entails entirely proprietary design (ie: no 510) and cannot feasibly be utilized with an existing tobacco product MABYE it will not fall under the deeming regs.\u000a\u000aThink Juul style device that is only packaged from the manufacturer without tobacco derived nicotine in any capacity.  That is the only realistic way in which there is a shed of possibility to fall outside the scope of the regs - and even that is not a guarantee per the FDA.
p214
aVTL;DR - but get the juul, downside is its expensive and hard to get. Upside is its the closest youll get to a cig while still being a vape. Next thing you can do is get a similar device with nicotine salts, it won't be the same but you can achieve similar results. Icare?
p215
aVPossibly. I've tried [[ Bedrock ]] and [[ Crme brle ]] through the Endura and it's got muuuuch less flavor than my Arctic. Disappointing...\u000a\u000aI tried my 45mg Mr Salt-E Fruit &amp; Menthol (bought for my Juul) and it's pretty good. Tastes practically the same as through my Juul. I dunno if that's a good or bad sign... \u000a\u000aI thought MTL was supposed to have more flavor. I'm still gonna stick with the Endura but I'll need to find flavors that work with it. I'm really enjoying Mr Salt-E high-nic juice, so I'll definitely be trying out a few more of their flavors.
p216
aVChapelle confirmed JUUL User
p217
aVI'm convinced. I'm buying a dozen Juuls and throwing them in with the rest of my **Y2K** emergency kit.
p218
aVIt's a Juul.
p219
aVthanks!\u000a\u000ai was wondering if it was a juul, for some reason i couldn't picture dave using one
p220
aVYeah its my only mod atm besides the Juul. So for now I will just go for 1k again and hope the counter ticks over
p221
aVThe Juul uses like 54mg nicotine salts and only contains .7ml per pod. 
p222
aVcan you explain the difference between nicotine salts and freebase nicotine? Does this difference make the Vuse more or less potent than the nicotine contained in a Juul? 
p223
aVThanks so much. At this point I'm just about to go to my local gas station and buy a Juul. 
p224
aVCould it be the device? I have even used a juul before which I believe are 50mg and it didn't feel like this
p225
aVAccording to a lil research, the Breeze runs around 35 watts while the Juul is at roughly 9. Still, I find it strange. My only other idea is that you're actually burning cotton instead of vaporizing juice, but you'd be able to tell if that was the case. 
p226
aV&gt; I've heard good things about the Suorin Air\u000a\u000aThey've been lying to you, albeit unknowingly. Do a search for them on this subreddit. Roughly half a dozen posts each day about them breaking in various ways. Twice that when high school isn't in session.\u000a\u000aJuul is a popular pod system. You don't have to refill it or anything, just put a new pod in.\u000a\u000aPersonally, I feel the refillable kits to be worth the savings.\u000a\u000a
p227
aVIf you find that your set-up is not doing it for you and you're tempted to buy a pack of cigs and alternate to 'ween' yourself off cigs, get a Juul instead.  You can go to Juul.com and see where they're sold near you.  The buzz and cigarette feel is very close to smoking.  \u000a\u000aIt's a very expensive system (not more than smoking though, relatively), but in my experience most smokers try to switch to vaping, get a set-up that doesn't *quite* satisify them, they decide not to *totally* quit smoking (use vaping to taper off), and eventually they're back to smoking again.\u000a\u000aThe Juul will help get you through the nic fits and help the transition to vaping.
p228
aVIf by premium you mean literally any juice that's not manufactured in house then you're wrong. If you mean actual premium juice lines then yeah, you're likely right. \u000a\u000aI think we have very very different definitions of absurd. I personally wouldn't have any issue with a shop adding nic. Or  menthol crystals. Or filling Juul pods. I don't know too many people who would have an issue with that either, but there's like 2 diy'ers including myself in my friend group so customizing juice to taste is fairly commonplace amongst our group. 
p229
aVDepending on how many coils and devices you go through the Juul may be not much more expensive.
p230
aVClosed system like Juul will always cost more. From what I hear, however, they have good customer service at least.
p231
aVHaven't tried them yet but from what I've read so far they seem to offer a different nic experience that's closer to a cigarette than freebase nic. That certainly seems to be the case with the Juul pods, people say it's the closest thing to the nic buzz of a cigarette on the market. Another good thing about nic salt juice is that you don't have to vape it as often as regular juice because the nicotine levels are usually higher. Most commercial nic juices I see these days are either 25mg, 40mg, 40mg or 50mg. It's more like a cigarette, you take 10 puffs and you're good to go. Definitely worth picking up a bottle and testing it out, that's what I'm doing.\u000a\u000a90% VG will be problematic in the Aspire Breeze, it won't wick that well and you may get dry hits. 70%VG or lower seems to be the best. 
p232
aVI came from smoking spirits and even I think that smoking a black pack of spirits feels less harsh than hitting a juul. The cigarette won't even give me a head buzz but the juul will
p233
aVI don't have the breeze, but I do have a Juul. First thing I say is when you get yours, register it. This will make it so if you have problems with it, they will replace it for you (you may or may not have to send it back). They have good customer service, I've dealt with them firsthand and it's been a pleasure.\u000a\u000aThe downside is the pods can get to be a bit expensive, I spend more than I would like to admit on them, but I would be lying if I said that I didn't love the shit out of that device and the way the nic salt formula they use hits you is the closest thing I've found to a vape as satisfying as a cigarette. It's prevented a few times where I almost lit one up, so I don't mind paying the extra money (although I am about to look into some open systems, because it's starting to hurt the wallet). 
p234
aVAlright thanks for the help, I'm planning on using a juul or something like it to quit cigs and wanted to get some info on them first.
p235
aVJuuls are a great start imo, though isn't much cheaper than cigs. I'd recommend starting with a Juul and if you like it buy something like an icare2 and some salt nic juice to lower the price longer term. \u000a\u000aAfter vaping for 2 years, salt nic is basically the same as other juices, just allows you to use lower watt devices and still get a satisfying nic feeling. Also helps be a bit more discreet than the fog machine vapes I had been using. 
p236
aVI'd recommend the suorin drop over the juul, you get to pick out of many more flavors and it's much higher quality
p237
aVHeres what I dont understand about the Sourin or JUUL
p238
aVNic salt amounts &amp; freebase amounts are different. Salts generally are higher nic. \u000a\u000aI have a juul and I use it alongside a direct lung device that uses 3mg freebase nic juice in it. I only get sick if I go and hit the juul like 20 something times like an idiot. You can generally tell when to stop, the juul also is designed to only be hit a handful or so times rather than be chain vaped.
p239
aVI prefer coils above 1 ohm for mouth to lung.  You're not really getting anything out of SS if you don't use temp control.  I wouldn't touch any ceramic coils -- they can be dangerous.  \u000a\u000a&gt;Like a JUUL with a bit more power and a little more airflow.\u000a\u000aIt sounds like you'd benefit from a tank built for MtL.  In the meantime, check out the claptons and see if you enjoy them more. \u000a 
p240
aVAnyone used this "eon" device that's JUUL compatible and vice versa.
p241
aVDon't ever buy directly from the manufacturers when it comes to Chinese vape products, it is known. I recommend a site like Vapecrawler which is basically Google for vape sites. U type what u want and they give you a list of every site selling it and how much they charge, as well as any coupon codes they have running. The sites I buy gear from mostly are eightvape, Breazy, Element Vape and FastTech when I don't mind waiting. Steer clear of dealing directly with any vape manufacturers unless you have to in the case of something like the Juul where it's not sold on vape sites. Also you'll usually pay a LOT more when dealing directly than u would on a vape site. For example, the Alien kit was like $100 on Smok's website but it's $50-60 anywhere else
p242
aVWell cigarettes surely gave you some good "feeling", didn't it? And that's already a thing. The big state University in my state has started to use the "juul" ecig to get buzzed during class due to it being so high nic content. My cousin goes there and they literally just sit in the back and take stealth hits to get through the Lecture (I go to a private University where this wouldn't be a thing). And ya I'm too young to legally drink but I never mentioned alcohol.
p243
aVHonestly, I don\u2019t know. I think it is, but my own data is skewed. I\u2019ve had 3 JUUL\u2019s. 2 work, one stopped. But I use them a lot more than my one Air. It still works, but I don\u2019t use it as often. \u000a\u000aI\u2019m guessing \u201cyes\u201d, but the price of the Air might make it worth grabbing a backup and sticking with it unless you get dinged by failure too quickly. \u000a\u000a
p244
aVLooking to get Suorin Air (coming from a Juul), does the liquid matter?
p245
aVBlu vs. juul vs. another small form ecig advice needed
p246
aVPerhaps an AIO or Pod device would suite you well. Something like an Aspire Breeze, iCare 2, Boulder Rock, Limitless Pulse, etc paired with some nic salt juice would be much cheaper than a closed Pod device like the Juul. 
p247
aVMy favorite Pod Mod is the [Limitless Pulse](http://www.vapecrawler.com/results/limitless%20pulse) as it has excellent flavor and good vapor and the draw is the closest to a cig (it's a draw fire, like Juul) to me also it feels great between your fingers at [Ecig-City it's $25](https://ecig-city.com/collections/cigalikes/products/pulse-pod-system-by-limitless-mod-co-2ml-refillable-cigalike-device) and [replacement pods](https://ecig-city.com/products/limitless-pulse-replacement-pods-3-pack) are 3 for $9.99\u000a\u000aThe [Boulder Rock](https://www.electrictobacconist.com/boulder-rock-vape-pen-kit-p1294) great vapor and good flavor and it's only $10 also has a fire button\u000a\u000aI highly recommend both
p248
aVIf you're trying to save money, I would not go with a juul. I've gone through a pod in a day and it starts to add up. I recently just bought a Suorin Drop and I am liking it very much. It has refillable pods so you can get juice that you enjoy the most (recommend going with nic salt based juice). Bought mine for $35 and after refilling the pods around 5 times they get bad so you'll need to pick new ones up. I think you can get them online for $3 a piece or a shop near me sells the pods for $5 a piece. Overall, would recommend over the juul. The drop is also very discrete you can hide it easily in your hand when you hit it.
p249
aVI tried a free one a year or so ago, among the worst juices I ever tasted was their rendition of tobacco. You hear the phrase licking an ashtray used before, this literally tasted like what I imagine it would be like. Even if it tasted good, it was still a shitty device. Basically a joye 510 (we're going back in time now) with a few changes and proprietary cartridges or whatever the hell you'd call them. It's old technology, that gives you a terrible experience overall. \u000a\u000aLike most big tobacco owned e-cigs (Mark Ten, Blu) they're I assume, still outdated, terrible flavor options, over priced, and almost pointless to use versus a pod system (Juul, Phix, Bo, Myjet, Dolphin, Penguin, the list goes on).
p250
aVThere's no shame in that, in fact I tried a few cigalikes myself in the early days. I think they changed since I had the one I was referring to since then, but there are still better alternatives I feel. That being said, if it keeps you from smoking or even smoking less, then who am I to judge? \u000a\u000aIt's also intimidating at first having to learn the technical jargon and finding something that works for you I feel, so you are not alone in that by any means. If your husband doesn't mind, maybe ask what he's using and to show you the ropes, if you don't want to go that route, there's things like the Juul (not the cheapest option out there I will warn you) and other "pod" systems (think like a cartridge you just pop in and out of a stick (the battery basically) and there's almost not much at all to learn with some of them. \u000a\u000aI have only tried the Juul so far, and yes pod prices can be more than I like to spend on liquid, but the warranty is fantastic and it kept me from giving into some recent cigarette cravings after months of not having smoked a single one. \u000a\u000aI heard good things about [this](http://www.bombies.com/starterkit-ns-bombies) and it's a great deal, so much so that I may get one myself soon when I get the extra cash. It's simple, refillable and you can order empty pods online (some shops may carry them, I am unfamiliar with the shop scene these days) which you can refill with juice like the bottle that comes with that combo kit they offer. There's a ton of other pod systems that will probably be mentioned also, my best advice is spend some time looking up user experiences, some youtube videos and other information and decide what would be best for you. \u000a\u000aIf you want a more advanced setup than that, there's a few things to keep in mind like the do's and don'ts of external batteries (with a little googlefu it's basically common sense shit), tanks with coils you screw in and change out as they wear out and a wide array of options out there. \u000a\u000aI would say start simple and if you want to, work your way up to something more advanced. And if not, that's fine too. I have a friend who uses the same setup she started with from day one and has no desire to use anything else if she doesn't have to. Personally I am into it on a hobbyist level and I like buying fancy things when I can, but I'm by no means better than her for owning more expensive and advanced setups. \u000a\u000aIn a way, I kind of envy her and wish I wasn't always looking for the next latest and greatest thing, she's saving a ton of money comparatively.\u000a\u000aLastly, I apologize if I came off rude, I just had a memorably bad time with that one Blu kit and it brought back some memories of a less than enjoyable experience. Congratulations also on quitting in November, it took me a few months to stop dual using and I had a few slip ups, so I'd say you're on the right path, and hats off to being able to do so with a cigalike like the Blu, I had to try several setups before finally finding the one that would do it for me. Keep up the good work.
p251
aVskip blu, get a juul.
p252
aVRefillable Juul like vape
p253
aV&gt; As I dont want to have seperate juice just for a MTL.\u000a\u000aKeep in mind you will go through juice far slower with the Nautilus and MTL than you will a TFV12. I was worried about the same once I recently started getting more into MTL myself, and I find my juice consumption on the setups I use for that is far less than any of my direct lung setups. \u000a\u000aI would say try anywhere between 6-12mg and see what you like. I normally direct lung 3mg, but mtl between 9-12mg, excluding the Juul which is a different case in itself juice wise. 
p254
aVPretty rampant in the schools around here, although most of them are using 0nic juice and some really terrible ego pens. Although devices like juul are also very popular as well. 
p255
aVThe transition period is far from a fun time, but at least for me it was about two weeks before I found myself craving my vape setups and ended up giving my leftover cigarettes away. \u000a\u000aJust have to be determined to push through that period, easier said than done of course, but very rewarding in the end in overall enjoyment, cost and last but not least the obvious health benefits. \u000a\u000aAnother thing to consider is that like any addiction, it's not uncommon to fall off the wagon during tough times or for whatever reason it may be, the key is to know you can always stop and try again. Of course, you shouldn't use this as an excuse or justification to begin whatever habit it was again, but it's almost a fact at this point (at least IMO) that regarding addictions this is a factor that I see often neglected to be mentioned here.\u000a\u000aI think it took me two or three tries before it finally worked for me. I still sometimes will have fleeting cravings for one, but then I remember how much I dislike the taste now (it's funny how mental associations switch like that) and the other negatives regarding smoking and I just stick it out. I think it's 15 minutes or less for the average craving to last with substances, so it's not the hardest thing to endure, and I have a high % nic salt pod system setup (Juul) as well, partially to help get through those times. The Juul may not be the cheapest option out there, but it serves its purpose for me, and does so with flying colors.
p256
aVKids love that Juul vape.  
p257
aVA friend of mine at work has been telling me that his middle school kids have been seeing Juul's being passed around at football games and such.  I did warn him of the very high nic salt content in a Juul and that it's probably not something a bunch of 14 year olds need to be doing. I vape nic salts as a former smoker of 32 years and I know how easy it is to over do it and get a horrible nic headache so I did tell him to talk to his kids about not hitting those high nicotine devices. It's not cool to throw up all over your friends and make yourself sick.  JMO. \u000a
p258
aVYeah, I quit with a Juul and I liked it for what it was....it's also expensive AF! I wish these asshole gas statons would stop selling them to 13 year olds. It's going to make nic salts harder for people my age to get. \u000a
p259
aVI feel like it's become an epidemic. I go to a public school in a good neighborhood and you can find somebody vaping in every bathroom of the school during the passing periods. I've heard schools in lower end neighborhoods have it worse, but I've heard about the same things happening at private schools as well. During finals week there were 15 kids in one bathroom just vaping and hanging out. The school sends out emails about vaping every week. Seems like everyone at the school bought a juul or a phix because they thought it was cool and then got addicted to nicotine.
p260
aVPod systems are probably the smallest, I personally love my juul and the weight and size of it, but it's seemingly a love it or hate it device based on the price of pods and sadly, some of the subculture surrounding it. There's a bunch out there, refillable and closed that would be worth researching into and seeing what you like the best out of whats available. \u000a\u000aI will say high nicotine content nic salt juice is no joke, sometimes just a handful of hits off my juul keeps me satisfied as much or sometimes moreso than much, much more off of my 12mg freebase juice I use in my other mtl setup. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's subjective. It does have its benefits though, and there's also lower level nic salt juice out there than the 50mg that is in the Juul pods. 50mg sounds astronomical, but being nic salts and the way the whole setup works, it's actually smoother than my 12mg freebase nic setup. Packs a punch though, especially if you never had salts before, especially at that concentration.
p261
aVNot cheap but the juul is my favorite stealth MTL vape. I'll buy a pack of pods and when they're empty i'll refill them a couple times.
p262
aVyup, first day off my juul I took 2 hits and was actually buzzed. 
p263
aVUsually I use a JUUL but I've been partial to the [Suorin Air](http://www.infinitevapor.com/The-Suorin-Air_p_404.html) lately. Perfect stealth vape since it's smaller than my drivers license and the flavor is surprisingly good.
p264
aVJuul is lighting up but not hitting?
p265
aVThey make the Juul
p266
aVThat's assuming he registered it for the warranty and is of age. No post history and not knowing that Pax is the parent company I guess of Juul makes me wonder..
p267
aVMy SXmini with a Kayfun Prime. Crushes my various thousands of dollars worth of other gear. \u000a\u000aJUUL with a Cool Mint pod for stealth. \u000a\u000aAs you can tell I\u2019m more of a MTL guy but when I\u2019m home and feel like being a dragon to the tikes I\u2019ll pull out my OG King Mod with a Dead Rabbit and fill up the living room in no time!
p268
aVJUUL! Quick, Easy, Discrete, Fun, and Nicotine!
p269
aVJuul for ease of use and portability.
p270
aVI've been running a kbox 200 for a while and it's been a solid mod. I just lost it though :(\u000a\u000aProbably gonna switch over to something in a juul form factor or get another kbox and try the new uwell crown tank. The first was my favorite when it wasn't leaking. 
p271
aVYou\u2019ll get some good advice here but I do know that it depends on the mod you use and other variables that are preference based. Low wattage devices tend to make less vapor which makes higher nic juices a better choice. Nicotine in salt form is smoother and faster acting at higher levels than basic nicotine. And preferred method of inhalation mouth to lung (MTL) mimics smoking sensation and also produces a bit more of a cigarette feel than direct to lung (DTL) which produces cloud like vapor (usually with a sub ohm tank) and can be difficult for New vapers/ex smokers. \u000a\u000aThere\u2019s a bit of a learning curve but there\u2019s ways to make it more convenient at an entry level. Premade juice, stock coils, internal battery device, etc. \u000a\u000aSomeone more versed in devices than I can possibly give better entry recommendations.  But I will say, a smoker who isn\u2019t ready to transition might never try it but it wouldn\u2019t hurt for you to give them the chance. \u000a\u000aBest of luck!\u000a\u000aEdit: general rule is 3 or 6mg max for sub ohm tanks, 6-12mg is usually sufficient for most daily vapers with lower wattage pen style devices but people do go as high as 50mg (salt nic) with pods such as juul. 
p272
aVHmm. I don\u2019t want a JUUL because I want to use my own juice. What MTL pod device would you recommend? 
p273
aVOk because the main reason I want to switch is I\u2019m not getting enough of a kick from 6mg subohm anymore, but 12mg destroys my throat. after trying a buddy\u2019s juul I wanted a device meant for MTL because I already MTL my subohm tank. Thanks for your help though, definitely appreciate it because I probably would\u2019ve gotten a Suorin
p274
aVSuorins are fine but they're finicky. I'm just gonna switch to a juul soon 
p275
aVI mean, you can get a DNA 250 on Fasttech for like $55.\u000a\u000aThe thing about a DNA40 mod is that even on something like a Supertank Mini, which is a pretty commonly recommended flavor tank, you're going to be running at or near the full 40 watts all the time, and that's hard on the batteries and the board.\u000a\u000aEdit: how committed to the DNA are you? Not knocking DNA board quality, but it may also be overkill for someone just coming off a juul.\u000a\u000aSomething like [this](https://www.elementvape.com/vaporesso-tarot-nano-80w-tc-starter-kit) gives you plenty of power, onboard battery, and a tank, and is a solid device.
p276
aVMy favorite moment would have to be getting my buddy who has smoked for 15 years finally off the cigs and on to a juul. May not be much but it was a great start! I think I have made it on the nice list for once!
p277
aVI gave my sister a Juul for Christmas yesterday. She opened it up and I set it up for her and explained it all and she took a hit and was shocked at how it felt. By the end of the night she was confident that she could use it to replace cigarettes. Also my grandma was not amused that my sister was ripping on the Juul in the house. (I since explained to my sister that vaping is generally considered acceptable in the same places as smoking, if you wouldn\u2019t smoke there don\u2019t vape there - unless it\u2019s your own home). Good stuff. 
p278
aVRemember That Everyone On This god forsaken forum hates anyone who wants to ask them instead of googling it themselves. If you're looking for an amazing cigalike look at the phix by mlv, the juul from pax labs, or the warlock p2 by rof. Good luck with the karma my guy!!
p279
aVIt might just be a bot downvoting you :) Give it time to balance out.\u000a\u000aFWIW I've gone from buying authentic mechs and expensive stuff (like ordering RDAs directly from a small machinist in Greece, and things like my authentic brass Kraken are just collecting dust) to a Subtank/Subox to a Cupti to currently an AL85. From Five Pawns to DIY.  I've found that after 4 years I'm over the collecting and cloud-chasing. Being a simple vaper is certainly cheaper. :D\u000a\u000aHave you looked into the Juul or Bo Vape? Bigger than a cigalike but they seem to be popular and the pods are refillable to some degree.\u000a\u000a
p280
aVyeah I was trying to consider a Juul but they seem pricier than the icare\u000a
p281
aVThe juul pods last longer than the cig alike pods. The aspire breeze might also work. 
p282
aVI love my Juul, but they are still expensive. What about the Aspire Breeze or better yet the Pockex. They're bigger but they do the trick and are both pretty satisfying vapes. 
p283
aVSo, have you heard of Ohman Mods? Made the Uno for the Billet Box, Pancake Dripper rda, bunch of stuff. Anyway, he's currently making a batch of his Dripsticks, a 14500 16mm hybrid mech, titanium, with rda, meant for salts/high nic. I haven't received the one I ordered yet, but god damn am I looking forward to a Juul sized mech/dripper, it looks badass
p284
aVThe Juul and Phix are well regarded in this current day and age. Neither are technically refillable, I know it's possible on the Juul, I haven't tried. \u000a\u000aThe pods could be cheaper that's for sure, but the great warranty they offer is why I chose it as my first pod system. I'm still researching refillable pod systems that are as close to the Juul as I can get in terms of size, weight and if possible customer service, so I can't really speak much on those. \u000a\u000a
p285
aVBo isn\u2019t TC so it gets dry burns rather easily. Juul is far better in that regard. 
p286
aVAlright I\u2019m on there but don\u2019t see any posts related to what you\u2019re talking about... maybe a photo from 2014 that looks Juul size 
p287
aVSorry I just did a quick search in the group, looks like the list closed at the end of November. It is the same size as a Juul, just 14500 mech tube, and he has redone the design from 2014. I guess your best bet would be a PM to Bret, or wait until someone decides to sell theirs once they start arriving 
p288
aVjuul or suorin air
p289
aVI was JUST watching a video on the Laan. Looks very well made AND it's available in Canada at my local shop.  VERY pricy compared to the Von ERL and Limitless but I am will to pay for a good device.\u000a\u000aLet me know how it is compared to the Von ERL please.\u000a\u000aJuul is not available in Canada.
p290
aVEither of the eleaf icares. I have both and they are very good and cheap. I also just bought kandypens rubi. Closest thing to a juul but you can fill the pods with your own juice. 
p291
aVPlease let me know how this is! I just bought a Suorin Drop and have found that it hits great with good flavor but after a couple refills of the pod I have been getting a burnt taste. I have around 5-6 replacement pods and with 2 left have been slowly realizing that I have not yet found the Juul-replacement I was looking for.\u000a\u000aThe Dolphin looks sweet and is in the same price range. Would really like to be satisfied with the product of choice so I'd really appreciate hearing your feedback after a couple of days!!
p292
aVSo refreshing to hear this kind of insight! \u000a\u000aI feared as much but it\u2019s indeed comforting to hear someone else confirm my beliefs. Makes me a bit more content on rebuying pods for my drop as that\u2019s the cheapest option and just waiting for the true \u201cJuul killer\u201d. \u000a\u000aI\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re enjoying your Dolphin. Sounds like some innovative tech that\u2019s going towards the right direction. I\u2019m definitely going to pick one up now for whenever I want a more consistent vaping experience than my Drop but I probably won\u2019t be taking it around as much, I just hate the aesthetics lol.\u000a\u000aI really appreciate this man, hopefully we\u2019ll be able to find the perfect product to talk about!! 
p293
aVJuul.  I went through the steps.  Juul is the best. 
p294
aVCan't get a juul in the UK, or at least not without ordering it from the US and hoping you don't get customs taxes or issues, even then your stuck for pods as we get a 20mg/ml cap on everything 
p295
aVI am 4 day\u2019s cigarette free and have been using a Ghost.  It is basically a Juul but you can buy empty pods.  I have been using Mr. Salt E\u2019s high nicotine juice but I think I\u2019m going to switch to the CRFT brand since I don\u2019t really like the taste of the two flavors I have tried.  Honestly though, I have been snusing some since snus satisfies me much more than vaping does.
p296
aVHonestly if you can the juul is a great alternative at first. 
p297
aVThat sucks. I like a lot of mods and juices but once I started using Juul it changed the game for me by a lot. The tabbacco flavor hits and like a cigarette and the flavor is damn good.\u000aIf you can't get it in the UK i would look at other nicotine salt options. Maybe mix your own if there is a cap on nicotine levels.  \u000aOther than that I would say just experiment.  \u000aI tried many devices before I found what I liked.  \u000aStarted with blue e cigs. Went on to vape pens. Got a low watt box mod. Then a high watt mod. Finally ended on my Juul.  \u000aAs for flavors start with what you would like.  \u000aNothing is 100 percent like a cigarette. Price is not really a good indication of quality. Wait for sales then mix it up some. Most vape companys I have tried had one or two that were really good and a few that were misses for me but hits for others. Its all about preference. The worst flavors I have ever bought came from my own local vape shops unique in store mixes.  \u000aBuy online. I dont know about in the UK but the shops here jack up the prices and have weak sales if any on mods at all and they charge full to over price for juice brands.  Not even close to a competition.  \u000aWould make some recommendations but you are in the uk so I dont know how helpful they would be.  \u000aGood luck and have fun
p298
aVI'm not the op but this is a great answer\u000a\u000aI went the diy route but would try a juul if not for the shipping costs of it +refills, but I am debating ordering some nicotine salt base from the US soon to get something similar at a reasonable cost\u000a\u000aJust hard to pull the trigger at 30+ for the shipping when I have a huge stock of normal nic base in the freezer

aVThe company that has impressed me the most is Sigelei.  Their customer service from a store's perpsective has been fantastic.  Even when things are out of range of our vendor's RMA process, they have replaced defective mods.  Great stuff.\u000a\u000aSmoant's Battlestar has been great for us as a super reliable, but still inexpensive mod.  \u000a\u000aThe Recoil Rebel is my favorite RDA of the year, with an easy to build deck, great airflow no matter which top cap you use, and the ultem ring that helps me with my consistent overdripping.\u000a\u000aThe Freemax Fireluke is hands down the best subtank I have used this year, with coil heads that just seem to last, and a build deck that made me give up on all my other rebuildable tanks.\u000a\u000aInnokin's T20S has been the best starter kit of the year in my opinion.  Great performance, low price, wonderful packaging.  The T20 is a great runner up.\u000a\u000aThe Baton pod system is the store favorite this year.  It's a simple little button-activated pod system that is styled much like the Juul, but the pods are made to be refillable.  The eliquid is made in Washington State, and tastes pretty dang good.  I rarely use mine anymore, but when I did it was very satisfying.\u000a\u000aStill my favorite DTL starter kit is the Eleaf iJust S.  Uses the ubiquitous Eleaf EC coil heads, has a 3000mah battery, and is overall a pretty solid, and great performing unit.\u000a\u000aAs for eliquid, I've been solidly impressed with Cloud Alchemist's liquids, and their Glacialis Menta has sold super well in our shop.  Cloud Nine from Oregon has always been big for us, but I'm still stuck on their Oregon Blackberry.  Oregon 33 makes another store favorite called Rogue.  Another new addition to our lineup at the store is the Aqua line, which has also been a big hit.\u000a\u000aAs for reviewers, I find myself watching GrimmGreen and Ruby Roo quite a bit, mostly because I like their personalities.  For pure information I watch DJLSB. 
p301
aV&gt;Anyone had any luck besides buying another one?\u000a\u000aNope. But I ain't mad. It's $20 china device. Any more and I might be salty over it, but a pack of JUUL pods costs about the same.
p302
aVJuul or iCare. You can\u2019t fix an auto firing Sourin as the multitude of other posts on here about the same issue have already dealt with this issue.
p303
aVI'm not salty either, man. Like you said, it's 20 bucks. I'm used to these salt-nic mods dying pretty quick, I just hoped for more than a month out of it since the others I've had last me at least a few. I guess it's time to go Juul, I've just been trying to avoid that since it's the priciest and most wasteful of them all.
p304
aVTo be fair, I've had JUULs shit out on me in a similar timefreame. They'll replace them, but they don't make it easy and it takes a fucking while. And 50mg is just too much for me anymore. I'm doing 25mg salts in the air.
p305
aVNoted, and thank you. I'm sure anything I buy has that chance, of course. I just feel like people who've had a Juul have had better experiences. 
p306
aVIf it was possible to fix the autofiring and it probably is, it'd cost you more for the repair than it did for the device.. , sorry bro\u000a\u000aOthers have already mentioned aspire. Breeze, i care, juul. I've had the icare and breeze. The breeze liked to give a little spitback but fiddling with the coil s wicking port tended to fix. I care was great all-around.
p307
aVHey thanks man! I mostly was concerned that it was going to crap out on me fairly soon due to reading reviews on them, so I wanted to find something that has a better rep and is compatible with my battery and Smok tank, do you have any advice for finding honest reviews? I\u2019ll def check out those joyetech coils btw. I still have some e-salt from when I was refilling my Juul and Von Erl(spits like crazy!) and it\u2019s working well for me.
p308
aVTl;dr - get nic salt juice in 12mg 6mg and 3mg. Get something mouth to lung preferably with an internal battery. Juul is $$$ but also easy and discreet. \u000a\u000aThere are some good suggestions here already. Definitely think success for a smoker switching over to vape is dependent on getting a few variables right, compared to how willing the person is to deal. For example: if she is desperate to quit, she\u2019ll vape through a juice even if she doesn\u2019t like the flavor. Some people won\u2019t vape a flavor they don\u2019t like at all. I\u2019d suggest getting something that is 12mg and 6mg so she can see the difference in hit (how harsh on the mouth/throat) as compared to how much nic it provides. I find new vapers not willing to hit vape over and over until they get their fix so going higher mg can help with making that transition. \u000a\u000aThat said, I found having some 0mg flavorless helped me at first too to cut down the strength so I could see how it affected me. Vaping nic is different than puffing. Smoking will hit you and remove cravings in seconds. Vaping takes a bit longer. For that, I\u2019d recommend for sure getting the salt version of the juice being bought. It\u2019s smoother at higher levels than regular and gives a bit more rush like a real cigarette. \u000a\u000aAdditionally , I find mouth to lung (mtl) style vapes are more natural for smokers in transition. Box style mods with external batteries are the best for price (eventually to save money people build their own coils for pennies to the dollar) and battery length. That\u2019s said, internal batteries are way easier and much more discreet vapes, if less satisfying to some degree (less vapor production = less nic on any given pull). Given that you may get a bit less vape this supports my opinion that going higher nic with an option for lower is good. Also the smaller ones can be easier to fill with often a bit cheaper coils. For some reason people will be shocked at buying a $5 coil but will spend $15 on a pack of Marlboro lights they can run through in two hours on a night out. \u000a\u000aLastly, I can\u2019t stand the juul but it\u2019s everywhere, it\u2019s easy to use, and it\u2019s small/discreet, and has loads of nic. A quick pull on that can deliver a good dose of nic while she figures out the rest. I think it\u2019s important to remember the goal is to quit and it\u2019s ok to buy something and not completely use it. Or not use it forever. Still cheaper than smoking and definitely way better for you. Lots of bumps in the road to quitting but we all get there. 
p309
aVI just tried Blvk Unicorn FRZNCHEE (frozen lychee) and it tasted really awesome, very lychee-like. It's a pity I was only able to find the 35mg one, as I'd imagine the 50 would maybe hit more menthol like? (I'm not sure though, as I don't think I'm very informed)\u000a\u000aI just got the Drop and I've tried a fair amount of juices since. It's a bit hit or miss for me though, some juices definitely seem to even pull differently and I've already got a bunch of cartridges to try various flavors. \u000a\u000aFor instance, NKD Brain Freeze and Frost Bite both hit really strong, with strong menthol taste (I greatly prefer Brain Freeze), and the tobacco flavor is not bad too. On the other hand, I hit the Hi-Nic Cereal and it took a lot more to draw and the smoke just tasted less flavorful (maybe it was the cereal?)\u000a\u000aI wish there were consistent answers but it seems like nic-salts are a relatively new domain, and just coming off of the Juul myself I figure it's the best option for my budget, but having a little reluctance with the unpredictability. I especially don't like filling up a cartridge (waiting a couple mins, which is fine), but only to find that the juice doesn't hit as nicely as I would've wanted!\u000a\u000a
p310
aVIndeed. I still go to r/juul for some comedy though 
p311
aVDepends on how strong you're vaping or style. Mtl vapers who want sth like 18mg or higher, or those who use those juul pod type devices will definitely want nic salts, as normal nic will get very harsh at that level. If it's just at 3 or 6mg, regular nic is fine. 
p312
aVthank you.  I got my Air YESTERDAY.  Waited 10 minutes, but every hit has been super like.. hot on my mouth? and SO harsh, like nasty.  The coil isnt burnt but I guess enough juice wasnt getting to the cotton/coil.  And the air side of the pod is extremely filled up with condensation, is that normal?  I blew into the fill hole and it pushed a bunch of juice into the cotton/mouth side.  It seems to be tasting a little better, just hoping I didnt hurt the coil/pod.\u000a\u000aAny suggestions for this new device? I am coming from the juul, which i LOVE.  I am looking to get some nicotine salts for the Air.
p313
aVA: the mouth piece of the air (and the drop) does get quite warm during normal use, especially if you are chain hitting it. this is probably adding to the feeling of getting super dry, harsh hits. you probably aren't burning your coil.\u000a\u000aB: the air side of the pod isn't covered in condensation, its actually just small droplets of e-liquid which have spattered out a little bit. you don't normally notice this on other vapes because the area around the coil isn't transparent.\u000a\u000aC:Blow into the fill hole more if you aren't getting the flavor you want, worst you are gonna do to your pod is push liquid too far,at which point you might suck some liquid into your mouth. Blowing into the fill port isn't just for when you prime the coil, but for whenever you get dry hits.\u000a\u000aD: Nicotine salts are the way to go with devices like this. and if you have a bunch of used juul pods laying around, you can refill those up with the juice too, and use the juul as a backup device. just be careful with the nic salts, as the air hits harder than the juul.\u000a\u000aE: Suggestions: be vigilant about preventing dry hits, buying new pods because you burnt your current ones sucks. Depending on your juice, and how good you are at preventing dry hits, you can get more then the 5 refills that the company recommends. be vigilant about the air continuing to hit even after you have stopped pulling; since you aren't inhaling and pulling juice into the wick, the wick can easily run dry and burn.either pull the pod out of the device, or hit the on/off switch. Carry a napkin or two on you, depending on where you keep your air(pocket, jacket, wallet, purse) the air pods leak a tiny bit the more you use them, but the leak occurs between the metal casing and the outer surface of the pod, and the surface tension of the e-liquid keeps the leak contained.The leak is very minor, but its something to be wary of. Another minor cosmetic thing, the glossy plastic of the pod scratches very very easily, so if you care about the aesthetics of your air, carry it in a different pocket than your keys, coins, e.t.c.\u000a\u000aF: Juice! I suggest Mr.Salt-e's watermelon flavor, and I've tried the non nic-salt version of Naked's Brain freeze, which is my favorite flavor of all time.\u000a\u000aSorry for the essay, I'm on break with time to burn and I like being thorough. Happy New Years and Happy vaping!

aVJUUL draws fine, but light no longer turns on
p315
aVI have the Mi-Pod and I love it. Perfect little on the go type vape. I'd also recommend the Juul, even though not refillable. I haven't used one but people seem to like that as well.
p316
aVWith a bit of patience (like 5 minutes for a pod refill) you can refill a Juul pod 2 or 3 times.  \u000a  \u000aPeople that have had no luck doing this usually forget to take out the cotton under the mouthpiece and dry it. Leaving it soaking with the previous pod's juices just makes it spit back and draw bad.  \u000a  \u000a  \u000aHow is your Mi-Pod I was looking into it because I want a Juul again...  \u000a  \u000aSome reviews were talking about leaking pods?  \u000a  \u000aDo you use Mr. Salt-E or some other nic salt juice, and if so what strength/brand?
p317
aVoof, a bit late.  \u000ai found a limited edition juul in a kind of local shop (15 miles away)  \u000aif i ever tire of the juul i'll probably re-look into the mi-pod again.  \u000ai appreciate the reply :)
p318
aVA pod system. There's open (refillable) and closed systems, but even one like the Juul (closed, not the cheapest pods in the world either) is cheaper than smoking, healthier, discrete and satisfying.
p319
aVMi-pod is very loose draw, so it might be effective in achieving the cig feel. I\u2019d recommend something like the Juul or Phix personally. The SMPO kit has the closest throat hit to a cig and the nic hits you like a truck.  I\u2019d definitely get a small cigalike with nic salts to help you quit cigs. 
p320
aVIf the Juul keeps you off the fags go with the Juul. That's the crux of all this shit IMO.
p321
aVDo you prefer the style of inhale on the juul or the Smok stick? They're very different devices.
p322
aVIf you want to use whatever juice you want there are a bunch of cigalike pods vapes that you can get refillable pods for like the limitless pulse\u000a\u000aThe bo functions the same as a juul with the one and done pods
p323
aVI'm weird I like both large clouds DTL, and the heavy nic of the Juul in tiny MTL puffs.  \u000a  \u000aIt's all about how much I get out of how little work I put in.  \u000a  \u000aJuul refilling is a bit more work than changing a coil once a week (if that's even possible anymore)
p324
aVThe Bo is only 10 bucks cheaper than the Juul, and comes with 2 pods instead of 4.  \u000a  \u000aHave you used this? I Have some questions if you have...
p325
aVjuul or suorin 
p326
aVYes it can!! In 2013 when is started vaping i developed severe stomach pains which ulitimaley led me to the er on a couple of occasions. At first I didn't put 2 and 2 together (the correlation between vaping and stomach pains) but sitting in the doctors office in early 2015 he asked me if I've changed anything or if I'm doing anything different and I said well yes...I started vaping in mid/late 2013. At that time I was using high pg eliquids and 18-24mg nic (for a year) and I did some research and found out pg can cause stomach pains as well as other ailments. I switched to MaxVg ejuices and went down to 3mg nicotine and it was much better. Unfortunately I got H.Pylori (no joke I think it came from dirty juice bc back then I got my ejuice from the flea market) and I was in pain from that and had to take antibiotics. As some ppl know I was in the hospital in September for pancreatitis which imo can't be from vaping (but who knows) but I'm still vaping and my stomach is much better now. Long story short switch to lower nicotine and get rid of pg and hopefully that'll work. I know MaxVg has some pg in it but I've been doing ok with MaxVg. This is just my personal experience, you might switch to maxvg and low nic and see zero improvement but it's worth a shot. If you can't use ur Juul there are other similar style vapes u can use that let you put ur own ejuice in it. If you like a tight draw the innokin endura t20 or t20s is really good. \u000a\u000a*EDIT* The [Limitless Ply Rock Pulse] (https://www.elementvape.com/ply-rock-x-limitless-mod-co-pulse-pod-system) has refillable pods (you can use ur own ejuice).
p327
aVWhats cheaper to do use? Mods with E-Juice or Juuls?
p328
aVAn open system is going to be far cheaper than using a juul. The expensive part is finding a setup and juice you like
p329
aVWell if you\u2019re interested in a juul type system, you could get one that has an open pod so you can use your own juice.
p330
aVMods with tanks and juice you refill yourself is a LOT cheaper than a Juul. Those pods are very expensive, hard to get sometimes, only have a few flavor options and only hold like 1.7ml. You're much better off with an open system imo. But something like the Joyetech Penguin/Dolphin might be a solid option that's kinda in the middle. They're only like $25 and hold 8.8 or 6ml of juice respectively and they're small and compact like a Juul. Not quite as small but little enough to fit nicely in your pocket
p331
aVGrandpa has lung cancer, should I get him a Juul?
p332
aVfresh air &gt; juul &gt; cigs. though, if you have lung cancer that should be a strong enough threat to your life to make you want to go cold turkey.
p333
aVNeither are great but a Juul or vape would be better than cigarettes. a regular vape might be better\u000a
p334
aVReally sorry to hear. Just lost my father in law to cancer. Same situation. Juul would be better. 
p335
aVThe figure put out by studies is 95% safer for vaping in general.\u000a\u000aThe juul is a very low output device,if he's still smoking it will be a drastic improvement.
p336
aVThank you for your advice guys! I will definitely ask his doctor if it\u2019s okay, my grandpa wants to quit smoking but he\u2019s doing it gradually, so now he\u2019s trying to smoke only 2-3 cigarettes per day. He hates the gum/ patches, so as long as the doctor says it\u2019s okay, I think the Juul will be a good alternative to the cigarettes. 
p337
aVI think you would fit right in on /r/juul 
p338
aVSychophantom has the right idea, a more involved set up will certainly provide you with a better experience, and something like the pico/Super Tank Mini would be a great set up.\u000a\u000aIf that doesn't sound like something you're interested in, I'd suggest looking into Innokin's line of produts, most notably the endura series. They'll be very similar to that smok stick you've got, but Innokin has a great reputation for quality and ease of use. I got a friend of mine the T22, and it's a great product.\u000a\u000aOther all in one (AIO) options would be the pod devices that have been big this year. I don't have much experience with them, but lots of folks here seem to love them.\u000a\u000aThe Juul would be another AIO thing to consider, though it's a bit pricey to own/operate from what I understand. Again, no experience with this device, so I can only say most feedback I've read is pretty positive.
p339
aVIf you mean very small, then definitely take a look at the juul. If you haven\u2019t heard of it, it\u2019s a pod system so they\u2019re pre filled and have nicotine salts so it had a smoother hit.
p340
aVThe ultimate vape in public device is a Juul, even though a lot of people here don't like it.  It's expensive to run all the time but it's the closest experience to a cigarette there is.  
p341
aVThe only other pod type system I\u2019ve tried is the icare and Juul. I love my Juul. Swear by it but I love my drop too. What other pods have you used?
p342
aVThe Boulder Rock, which I like but has an annoying whistle. I don't buy pod systems that aren't refillable because it's too expensive. I make my juice so I really can't defend paying for Juul pods. Do ypu hack your Juul pods to refill?
p343
aVYes I definitely refill my Juul Pods. I am a huge fan of how the cucumber and mango pods taste. I would kill for some good cucumber juice. Do you make Salt Nics? 
p344
aVIs it possible for you to return the Alien altogether and get a different mod? I never had anything but problems with my Alien. It sucks because the potential is there. But it's just little things like...the top fill door swinging open in my pocket every day. The battery door not shutting right from day 1. Etc.\u000a\u000aCan you go get a Juul or cigalike (blu etc) to tide you over and swap it out? That's really my only suggestion, unfortunately. I'm sorry. I switched over to the VooPoo drag recently and am very, very happy.
p345
aVThe Juul is a great device, but with the steep price tag and non-refillable pods, you can do much better with your money. I'd love to suggest a few mods but MTL vaping isn't my forte. 
p346
aVUS: Juul Raising $150M, presumably for Expansion
p347
aVI quit my job last month and starting selling Juuls full time outside of schools. I sell them for double retail and make atleast $100 a day. Easy money. 
p348
aVGreat, an opportunity to hop on my alt account and talk shit.\u000a\u000aJuul/Ploom is one of the oddest birds i've encountered. I was at the Miami show a month before they launched and tested them out and put in a small pre-order. I've had them at all locations since launch and they've been nothing short of a nightmare of a company to work with. They routinely take months to fill orders and have never, ever caught up to the demand. Sure, its cool you have a hot product and all, but they've seemingly done nothing to support their retailers. Its rumored they do this on purpose to drive people to their site for orders, but even on the site they have delays and backorders. If you don't want to sell them in shops and want to just sell online, JUST TELL ME SO. I'm perpetually stuck in a spot where I can't tell them to "fuck off" because customers are beating down my door looking for pods. I don't know what they put in those pods, but Juul customers are like rabid lemmings looking for their fix, so i'm forced to keep stocking it. I just have to put in a $30k order and hope that they'll show up in under 3 months.\u000a\u000aI was glad that Phix and Von Erl converted a few of those customers, but still the demand is high. As a company with so much rolling in, I find it astounding that they need to do a round of fundraising to finance whatever they're doing. \u000a\u000aHere's an idea Juul: If you need to raise money, how about selling some fucking product? You've got endless PO's but you can't get your supply chain together after a year? \u000a\u000aI'm well aware that i'm the odd man out when it comes to financial and investment strategy. The correct thing to do is ignore your fundamental business and make up a bunch of fluffy optimistic numbers and get a bunch of VC whales to bankroll whatever hair-brained project you shat out. Then, you funnel out funds into bonuses and salaries until the money dries up and you do it all over again. Maybe i'm reaching here - - i'm reaching.\u000a\u000aAnyway, i'm jealous of Juul, that they can make a product so hot it doesn't matter if they fulfill it because people will line up and wait until they're goddamn good and ready to put it out. I wish I had that kind of product. Until then, i'll begrudgingly fork over cash and wait like a good little bitch for them to send me product.
p349
aVLmfao.. I\ufe0f thought I\ufe0f was subscribed to r/juul it\u2019s too damn early..
p350
aV&gt;I don't know what they put in those pods, but Juul customers are like rabid lemmings looking for their fix\u000a\u000aCan confirm. Switched from high quality open system rigs that this sub loves to Juul. Am rabid lemming.\u000a\u000aI loved my Kayfun but it is nothing next to the Juul. 
p351
aVI dont get it.\u000a\u000aI'm a volume vaper. I like vaping a lot, not taking a few vapes and not vaping for a while. I'm chucking that shit 24/7. Juul makes me nauseous and the battery dies fast. Good for in-flight vaping, but not great for day to day (for me)
p352
aVNeed money? I have a crazy idea. How about you actually make your Juul pods so people can buy them.\u000a\u000aYou are already charging way more than you should for the fucking things.  How about using that profit to actually, you know, make more, than just sell those. With the massive demand you have for pods, it should be pretty easy to come up with that 150 million.
p353
aVMy shop sells juul, and while it was a bit Rocky at first due to their high demand, I get large orders from them every week with no problem. That being said, I still do so alternate pod-based devices just to help alleviate the demand for them. They have really stepped their game up since they first started.
p354
aVI've tried to respond multiple times but can't quite articulate what I'm trying to say.\u000a\u000aI think you nailed it at the end with the "for me" thing.  If there's anything this sub has taught me, it is that different people have divergent preferences in regards to how to ingest their  nicotine.\u000a\u000aWith the Juul craze in particular, I think there are two factors of why it is so popular:\u000a\u000a-It is incredibly easy.  I bought my first Juul because I was going on a trip and bringing my mod, juice, cotton, etc wasn't practical.  The masses aren't into the hobby side.  I was for a while but I learned from this trip that I really dug the no hassle, maintenance free approach.\u000a\u000a-This is the bigger one for the craze, I think.  **Juul is addictive af.**  Like, cigarette level of addicting.  The fact that you can get away with using it in many places that you can't smoke probably adds to this.  I too am a volume vaper -- I'm hitting my Juul all day everyday.  I am under no illusions here: I am insanely addicted to this thing.  I'm sure that is driving demand.      
p355
aVI was waiting for someone to jab me on this.\u000a\u000aVaping on a plane is definitely a bad idea. Not only does it make vaping look worse than it already is (can it get worse?) but it can also ding your wallet. IIRC, its a $2500 fine if they catch you.\u000a\u000aHowever, I take heavy precautions when I do it. When I see a lot of people vaping in places they shouldn't, they make **no effort** to conceal the vape. They exhale normally as if they aren't capable of holding it in and exhaling slowly, or they simple don't care and are authentic douche nozzles. \u000a\u000aWhen I vape at 30,000 feet, I take great care and preparation to position myself for full concealment. I put my sunglasses on and envelop myself in a cocoon using the provided $0.25 fleece blanket. I then nod to the side as if i'm asleep. Little do they know i'm actually awake (haha!) and preparing to strike. I've already secured the Von Erl / Phix / Juul in my hand deep inside the cocoon I ready it for action. I wait for the precise moment that the stewardess is walking away from me into the galley and bring it to my mouth, drag, and hold. The hold is the important part and where most people fail. You don't need to exhale like you normally would. The exhaust is what gets  you caught, and you need to hold that in. Finally, engage in a series of short exhaust puffs **through the nose**. This is key. Between these pulses, you inhale 30% more than you exhaled. This seems to reduce the amount of vapor until it's virtually nothing. Additionally, you want to keep your window closed. Light rays will show the vapor and get you nicked. In a pinch, you can also use the aforementioned $0.25 fleece blanket to exhale into and reduce the vapor further.\u000a\u000aIn closing, I know plane vaping is wrong, but with the effort I put into concealment I am certain nobody is aware of what i'm doing and i'm not contributing to the negative perception of vaping. 
p356
aVHIT THE JUUL
p357
aVI'm used to it. I've never even seen a Juul irl. Lul 
p358
aVI use my Juul when I\u2019m out and about, mostly beacause it\u2019s so much easier to carry around than a regular mod and juice.  However, when I\u2019m back at home, I\u2019m on my squonker pretty much the whole time.  I\u2019ve not really noticed any addictive qualities to the Juul other than the convenience of only needing to carry one extra pod and maybe an extra battery if I\u2019m out running errands - I switch back and forth all the time.  I\u2019m actually on a business trip with my Juul right now and really missing my squonker and regular juice...
p359
aVI have a love hate relationship with Juul. But I can't bring myself to use clunky mods or separate coils/separate juice.\u000a\u000aIn your opinion, what's a better pod system with the same type of functionality/quality at a lower price point? \u000a\u000aI'm a heavy user at a pod a day and sometimes I run out before my autoshipment comes. I'd like to switch to something cheaper but I'm busy with work and Juul just works
p360
aVIt's **ALWAYS** too damn early when it comes to r/juul.
p361
aVDo juuls destroy the throats of anybody else? \u000a\u000aI mean I totally stopped vaping after getting my SO a juul to switch from smoking. And every time I hit it DESTTTTTOORRROOOOYED my throat. Like incredibly harsh. \u000a\u000aIt seems like they're products are incredibly inconsistent, a ton of the pods we bought locally were tasteless (menthol) and leaking when we got them. 
p362
aVI feel like a third party company from another country is missing out on a huge opportunity by not selling refillable juul pods. I'd be all over those. 
p363
aVWhat do you think makes Juul so good compared to other vapours?
p364
aVPercentage wise? It's pretty obvious the juul smoker is using upwards of 50mg compared to the average vapers 3-6mg
p365
aVOh I definitely 100% agree. When I tried a juul I thought "damn I haven't had a buzz in years!"
p366
aVAh the Juul, every kid on my campus has one and laughs at my voopoo for not being a vape. 
p367
aVI had no problems switching from cancer sticks to e-juice. So, the Juul doesn't appeal to me. Especially when I consider the price. 
p368
aVThey are super discrete, dead simple to use, and reliable. I've been vaping for 5-6 years and I was getting really tired of getting the random bad coil in a pack, occasional leakage, buying juice online because all the local vape shops sell juice that was saccharine-sweet, etc. \u000a\u000aEverything about the Juul is easy. You drop a pod on the Juul and draw. The battery lasts quite a while since you're not taking multiple long hits to satisfy your craving. To charge it, you just drop it on the charger. I've not had a single official Juul pod with a burnt taste, though I've had some that don't hit as hard as others. Since they're so small, they lend themselves well to people like myself that fidget from time to time. I'm looking at some alternatives to Juul, but they'll have a pretty high bar to reach. \u000a\u000aThe downsides to the Juul is the cost, availability, and variety of pods, and they are more addictive than regular vaping. I was on my out of the vaping game when I tried a Juul. At that point I hadn't hit my vape in a couple of days, and I wasn't going to touch analogs. I stupidly tried the Juul and was instantly hooked -- the hit is definitely similar to a cigarette. I can definitely see why they're popular with the high school to college-aged crowd, which is unfortunate because a lot of them didn't grow up smoking, so they're picking up a needless habit.
p369
aVI would definitely say the reliability of the Juul would be up for debate as you can probably see in the comments and are you not worried at the amount of nicotine you're consuming? I was informed it was around the 50mg range which is ridiculously high comparing to the usual 3, 6 or 12mg dosage.
p370
aVVery similar experience here as well. I\u2019ve been Vaping for 5 years and have started used everything from cigalikes to high end mech mods and attys. I was also weaning off it getting a bit tired of the hobby (time consuming and $$$$) and the Juul got me hooked instantly. It reminded me of why I started vaping and the ease of use and quick portable nic fix keeps me using it. \u000a\u000aI\u2019ve since used a handful of similar systems but they all fall a bit short in some way. I recently got to try a phix last week and it may very well be the closest thing to a Juul if not on par with it. The downside to me is the device is considerably bigger and the pods require tools to pull apart. I love that it uses magnetic pods since the Juul pods become loose over time. I really wish someone combine the 2 devices and created one with easy to refill pods. The Juul pods last me about 4 refills so that helps even out the costs. Even if they were cheaper however, I\u2019d still opt to refill since there are so many better nic salt juices out there (ex flavor chaser). 
p371
aVEverything in my post is true for me. The Juul could be a very unreliable product in general but I've never experienced major issues with it in the four or so months I've been using it.\u000a\u000aRegarding the amount of nicotine, it is far higher than standard vapes per hit, but you're also taking less hits. Trying to vape a Juul as you would a mod won't work. Not sure if that's true for other nicotine salt-based systems.
p372
aVWhy anyone would get a Juul when the Suorin Air exists is beyond me.  Well I guess brand recognition and convenience. 
p373
aVcheck /r/juul    
p374
aVThere's a reason people are feinding for juul pods no? More so than other devices. It's a fact juul pods are more addictive you can ask anyone who's used multiple devices, maybe not from the concentration but the nicotine salts themselves. 
p375
aVSee I can't quantify that, but I use similar strength nic salts in stronger devices and don't feel the same "addiction" I did when using Juul. 
p376
aVI put my old mod at 220 for my friends with juuls and they lost their fucking minds. 
p377
aVMy mom just started using one and she can hardly feel it since she's used to cigs. I tried it and it's quite strong. About as strong as using 12mg juice with freebase nic, even though the juul is 50mg nic salt.
p378
aVThe reason why they're so addictive is because of the Benzoic acid they put into the juices. The 5% nicotine is equal to 59mg nic/ ML per pod. \u000a\u000aThe benzoic acid is that allows the nicotine to be absorbed into the body at a much faster rate. Hence why the consumer always receives the experience of their first cigarette after hitting the juul for the first time of the day. Every. Day.\u000a\u000a https://support.juulvapor.com/home/learn/faqs/juulpods-juice    -     Sauce \u000a\u000aI manage multiple vape shops and receiving 25+ calls a day about juul pods can easily be aggravating . \u000a\u000aAlso, a customer is paying 16.99-19.99$+ for a pack of pods. In each pod is 0.7 ML , so they're paying close to $20 for 2.4ML of juice. That's over $170 for a freaking 30ML!!!! I want to feel sympathy for the juul users, and I try to explain the math to my customers but a lot are too intransigent to switch to a Suorin or a breeze.
p379
aVI read that same article and I own a Saurin and a Pulse. They arent nearly as good a product. They give dry hits and leak ultra high juice into your mouth. \u000a\u000aThe reason Juuls are taking over the market is because they are simply the best nicotine delivery system on the market.\u000a\u000aThat's all ecigs are. Nicotine delivery systems. \u000a\u000aEveryone is throwing a fit because they used science to find a better way to do it.
p380
aVOr for people that physically cannot fill pods and tanks or fuss around with the other nuances of vaping. I just bought a Juul for my sister because it's literally the best option for her (has MS and terrible tremors, she shakes so much there is no way in hell she would be able to fill a pod on a different device). 
p381
aVNo its WAY more addictive. I know from personal experience. I have all kinds of devices from series mechs and rdas to a nautilus tanks and micro vapes. \u000a\u000aAt .14-.17 ohms and 3mg.... I cant EVER get close to a nic buz like a juul. \u000a\u000aIf it was 12mg or 18mg in the juul or even 20, not a big difference. But at 50mg, its a huge difference. 
p382
aVHahaha dude... Hit your juul.
p383
aVEverybody I know has experienced dry hits and spitting from their juul.
p384
aVYeah.. don\u2019t do that.\u000a\u000aThat was what originally got me to transition from RDAs to a juul. I hated how obnoxious the clouds were especially when people would chuck clouds during highly populated areas. The juul was preferable to me because it was discrete and it did not bother those around me.
p385
aVI don't know how you deal with these people. They sound like heroin addicts. This is one of the top posts of the sub:\u000a\u000a\u000a&gt;hey reddit, my name is Max and I'm an 18 year old senior in high school. I just wanted to give some light on what the Juul is like at my high school, because honestly what it has become is truly fascinating. To start, vaping in the Men's bathroom was always a frowned upon activity. Kids would shit on others for it, and even smoking cigs people look down upon (except for the angsty kids that listen to Mac Demarco and such). But what I love about the Juul, is it has become so addicting that it has become seen as cool, almost as a way for people to subconsciously cope with their addiction. Between classes the big bathroom in my school averages 20-25 kids, and 5-10 juuls. Kids usually will give you a dollar for a juul rip if you don't know them, if you want to buy a pod for 5$ you just head into the bathroom after lunch. We call the kids in there between every class begging for rips "Juul fiends." Pod boys are the freshman that say "can i put my pod in ur juul?" and are in there every block. I myself spent about 180$ on mango pods and bought out a store, and sold these pods for 10$ a pod, making myself an absolutely massive profit in literally 9 days. Given because I'm 18 with a car and that's the tobacco age around here, I always get offers to get pod runs or juuls for kids. people even understand the best system to get a head rush in your 2 minutes between classes, is all the juuls at once. So someone yells "GIVE ME ALL THE JUULS" and 3-7 are passed around, two hits each. This saves us all juice, and gives you a massive head rush. Kids also scratch logos and words onto their juuls to make in their own, every day you can find the pod covers in my student parking lot. I know this sounds exaggerated, but with a school with 1400 kids near the city and juuls being perceived as popular, it's truly fascinating what can happen. Also, one smoke shop had the crisp pear pods, and a kid sold them for 15$ a piece. Those pods are fucking amazing by the way, they taste like a green apple jelly beans. Well, just thought I'd type this out to see if anyone has a similar experience to me in their school or was interested in it, if you have any questions i'm happy to answer. Thanks for reading!

aVJesus that was some horrid shit to read. I figured out the douchyness of it when a customer who was in between HS and freshman year kept asking if I had pods in. Then another day I had about 4 groups walk in, and not shitting here, 5 phone calls in one day asking for pods. I've been doing this almost 5 years and this was out of the blue. Finally asked my younger customer what the fuck, why that instead of the 9 other options we have? \u000a\u000a"It's small, portable, sleek, and you don't use it as often. Oh and it's really smooth for being high nic"\u000a\u000aThen I remember he never smoked. \u000a\u000aAnd that's when I realized that kids are vaping it just for the nic buzz. Whatever their marketing is (I haven't seen any) is working.\u000a\u000aJuul is fucking Joe the camel. 
p387
aVHow many refills can you get out of the pods? Do you have a Juul as comparison? It\u2019s caught my eye however every Juul alternative I\u2019ve tried so far is now collecting dust. I\u2019m looking for a similar draw. Any leaking issues? I saw that suorin also has a new device coming out called the ishare (stick device with pcc). 
p388
aVI feel you. I work for a vape shop and getting ahold of these bastards are a process. I\u2019m in the Texas Tech area so students are obsessed with these. Just recently have we been able to get ahold of a good amount of Juuls and the pods and it\u2019s been great for business but still I definitely agree with you. 
p389
aVI know people who go through a pod every day, easily. When they are out drinking, they'll kill a pod in a night. Ezpz. And it's not just like one person out of a hundred who does that, it is a lot of customers who tell me the same thing. My shop is located in a highly populated area with a lot of locals AND tourists. So I meet people from all over the US who uses the juul.
p390
aVIts kind of common sense. Different nic levels at different quantities of vapor deliver different amounts of nicotine. Resulting in a nicotine rush. Basically if you dont get one with device a, and you get one with device b, then you are absorbing more nicotine with device b. Just because you like to be condescending and and ass hole, it doesnt change the fact that juul delivers WAY more nicotine than 95% of devices/set ups out there.\u000a
p391
aVLmao no its both. Of course it has moatly to do with the fact that its a nicotine salt. Im not illiterate. Ive used juul before. Ive done my research on it before. And i know what im talking about. But the fact that its still 50mg per ml is ridiculously high. And the fact that it absorbs so quckly into your system means you are getting all that nicotine even faster. \u000a\u000aWhich gives you the nic buzz. Idl why you keep repeating that stupid phrase over and over. That must be all YOU care about.... \u000a\u000aI know for a fact that my nicotine tolerance was sky high while i used the juul. It was higher concentrations that absorbed faster. \u000a\u000aIf you compare it to any other product that i used, it only made me more addicted to nicotine. \u000a\u000aIdk why you keep arguing with me about this. 
p392
aVTalk like that gets you banished to r/juul 
p393
aVLook man, if Juuling on some dope mango pods makes you wrong, I don't want to be right.\u000a\u000aCan't wait for the Juul craze to die.
p394
aVI fear the juul scene will never die. \u000a\u000aWas another shit show today in ECR. So many people posting about RTA and **BEST** lol
p395
aVI wouldve never believed I could quit, never in a million. \u000a\u000aMy kids bought me a Juul...and that was bankrupting me so I got my own ....and thank the Gods for this place. Im freaking thrilled I found it! 
p396
aVIf she smokes menthol, that Juul will be the closet to a cigarette hit she'll find. Thats what got me off the stinkies! 
p397
aVI've heard great things about the Juul, but haven't tried it yet.  I tried the Von Erl, the Limitless (Plyrock) Pulse, and the Phix.  Von Erl died after a month.  Pulse has pods you need to fill yourself. Not too difficult but adds a bit of mess and complexity.  Phix is little more econonomical then Juul.  Phix pods hold a little more than the Juul pods and are 50mg of nicotine. For on the town and in the car,  I use the Phix.  If you are willing to deal with coil replacements and e-juice refilling, the Aspire Breeze works pretty good with some 25mg nicotine salt e-juice.
p398
aVShit man. Went to Circle K and got my sister a Juul for Christmas... $82 for the device and four pods.. what a fucking racket!
p399
aVShe has MS, is in a wheelchair, and has horrible tremors. The Juul seemed liked the best option with no refilling and pods are readily available around here. Was going to go with the Boulder Rock but there\u2019s no way she can manage to fill the pods. 
p400
aVYeah I have a pulse. But I don\u2019t see her often enough to be sure I can always have pods filled so the Juul was literally my best option. I\u2019ve been going back and forth on this decision for a few weeks now. 
p401
aVOf course. I\u2019m the same way. She\u2019s just not capable of filling her own pods or anything so I need the most plug and play option available and the Juul is it at this point. 
p402
aVLogic seems to have stepped up their game. Went from a Juul to this, and I\u2019m pretty impressed. On another note, any idea how to refill the cartos?
p403
aVCan anyone in the uS help me get a juul ecig kit?
p404
aVTry [Kindergarten](/r/JUUL)
p405
aVFree juul skins
p406
aVI'd say to turn down the wattage, but seeing that you are using Juul...\u000a\u000ago to r/juul
p407
aVYeah, realistically I find cigalikes don't work for most people trying to quit but that depends on your vaping preferences.  I suppose something like the juul would work.  I second the zelos kit.
p408
aVHonestly Juul is still the way to go. If he's already a heavy smoker, then the initial cost will not be more than smoking. Eventually he will taper down and start to save money. Juul really is by far the best device for people who aren't interested in the hobbyist side of things.
p409
aVWhats the big deal about the juuls?
p410
aVUnder 18 crowd. They are in every gas station and extremely easy for underagers to get. Rather than go into a store like ours and get id'ed, they go with the juul. 
p411
aVI really like my juul as a second device. I refill the pods with 50mg salt nic and its a nice cigarette-like hit for when I don't want to blow clouds. I usually use it at work so I don't annoy people. In terms of vape quality for a mtl I'd much rather use my squape rs or kayfun prime but it's much more upkeep compared to the pod devices and I'm lazy 
p412
aVThe Juul is an awesome little device, but its image is being trashed by all the kids glomming onto it.\u000a\u000aIt gives the closest approximation to an actual cigarette I've experienced. Also very no-fuss in its operation, which is great for anybody who doesn't want vaping as a hobby, but just as an alternative to smoking cigarettes. \u000a\u000aThe drawback is the expense. The pods are very expensive. $4 on the cheap end, $6 or more in high-tax states. 
p413
aVwell juuls have their own proprietary salt nicotine formula and both are super portable
p414
aVYeah. A pod is roughly a pack. The price comparisons vary by state. For example, smokes in CA are now about $7 a pack, and pods are $6 each. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s intentional on JUUL\u2019s part. \u000a\u000aSo if you\u2019re comparing to cigarettes, it\u2019s still cheaper. But not nearly as cheap as vaping on a more conventional mod/atomizer combo.

aVPIC: Charge MyJet with Juul charger
p416
aV"What rips better, a saurin air or saurein drop? I don't llike juuling, so dont bother recommending it."
p417
aVOh dude I\u2019m there with you. I always have people saying \u201cdude, your tank doesn\u2019t even rip, get a dripper\u201d and like...I hate that huge clouds and \u201cripping\u201d Juuls has become a thing. It pisses me off that much more when it\u2019s underage kids telling me this. I\u2019m not even old but I wanna tell them to get off my lawn and shake my cane at them! 
p418
aVAn alarming amount of people are using JUUL as a clan tag and it's passing me off.\u000a\u000aGoddamn children.
p419
aVWWII\u000a\u000aLike it's insane how many people are using it. Some people even make fucking emblems of juuls. \u000a\u000aI've never been more disappointed at anything.
p420
aVXbox. That might be part of the issue.\u000a\u000aI haven't seen it much in hardcore, but juul is all over core game modes
p421
aVCall of duty WWII. \u000a\u000aThere's not even really structured clans in this game, just a lot of idiots using juul
p422
aVI've used the following:\u000a\u000a* **Suorin Air**  - refillable 2ml pods are nice. One went bad on the 2nd fill, but the other 2 I've tried lasted longer. Lots of posts about these failing. So far so good but I want to find a replacement.\u000a\u000a* **Phix** - I liked this device a lot, and really enjoyed the Butterscotch Tobacco but the pods spit back and leak to the point I was constantly blowing through it to clear juice before using.\u000a\u000a* **iCare v1** - hated this, constant dry hits and just bad performance.\u000a\u000a* **Envii Fitt** - this was pretty nice. Good variety of flavors, though the pods did leak some. Might try it again with refillable pods.\u000a\u000a* **Juul** - I used Juul for a year and a half but their QC is garbage, they seem to have changed the flavors some, and the popularity with high school kids means pods can be hard to find.\u000a\u000a* **Innokin Pocketmod** - So far this is my favorite of the bunch. Solid build, bulkier than the others but the 1.2ohm coils work well with nic salts. Will buy another.\u000a\u000a\u000aI also want to try the Fuchai v3, Warlock Peas, and Kimsun Slim 2R.
p423
aVI'd love a good dry herb tank bro, I'll have to look into it. I've used a concentrate tank before and it was dope, as for MTL the juuls been getting mad good reviews, I've used one and it was good honestly no throat hit. high mg nicotine salt pod system, but the nic salt doesn't have a throat hit it's fire 
p424
aVIMO the juul is best

aVI would be happy with finding a reliable source for Scorpio juice by Twelve. All i can find now are things for the juul
p427
aVA Juul. 
p428
aVI've been vaping on dual battery box mods for the past two years, and hands down the best MTL experience I get is from a ploom Juul
p429
aVNo juuls in the great Northern states?
p430
aVYou can definitely get that \u201cfirst drag\u201d feeling with a Juul or high nic salt device. Still not the same as lighting up that first cigarette in the morning though 
p431
aVThis is answered explicitly on the website you linked to.  Distributors pay the excise tax.  Purchasers outside that supply chain are expected to self-report and pay a "Tobacco Use Tax" (only) if their consumption is more than $50/month.\u000a\u000aJuul is also sold all over the place, not sure where you got that business about website exclusivity.  They have a store finder.\u000a\u000aAll that said, the best solution for your mom is probably the one that is easiest for her. Nothing sends a smoker back to cigarettes like suddenly realizing you have to wait a week for eliquid. Literally any e-cigarette option is going to be cheaper than smoking if you've already paid for the hardware.  Highly suggest checking the retail options around her and picking a solution that allows stocking up locally if a shipment is delayed.\u000a\u000aOblig: Not your lawyer. Don't take Internet legal advice.
p432
aVWhen I used vape in the past, I had few ego batteries 650 and 1300mah, i dont remember all atomizers but I surely had CE5+. As for the coil I dont know the english name for it but it probably was called clearomizer dual coil (?). It was pretty good and gave me huge clouds, but I want something much smaller, more solid with no drips and spills, something more "pocket proof". I dont need a large battery as its going to increase the size of the pen. I would probably not exceed 20 puffs per day, it would be nice to be able to charge in in the car. \u000aI think that Juul would be perfect if I was able to buy lower nicotine level cartridges or was able to fill it up with my own liquid, it looks slick and pocketable. 
p433
aVAs far as I know, nope.\u000a\u000aA pod system really sounds like your best bet. Like the Breeze or Sourin Air. The issue is that pod systems came about from JUUL's being so expensive and non-refillable, so any pod system you will have to fill just like any atomizer.
p434
aVOkay so I am left with 4 vapes to choose from:\u000a\u000a- Aspire Breeze, its little bulky, the liquid fill system is not great, no replacable pods\u000a\u000a- Suorin Air, I like that its so thin but Im not sure if its comfortable to use, the battery is not too big\u000a\u000a- iCare 2, I dont think there is anything to complain about here, they fixed the driping issues\u000a\u000a- iCare Solo, its the best design for me, i like the Juul-like style, dont know too much about this, there isnt many comparison\u000a\u000aWhich would you recommend? 
p435
aVIs refilling Juul pods worth it?
p436
aVI refill my Juul pods. I get about 4 refills in them (clear juices) before they taste a little burnt and I toss them. It\u2019ll still be more expensive than most refillable systems because you inevitably need fresh pods. I have an icare mini I used for a short while but the spitting was too much and I didn\u2019t like the draw/hit that was produced. Ultimately it comes down to preference and budget. 
p437
aVHey Team,\u000aI have just uploaded a video to YouTube on how I refill my pods using a syringe. I\u2019ve figured out a way to refill with NO leaks.\u000a\u000aI am also getting 10+ refills on one pod and it still runs the same as the first time.\u000a\u000aI was living in the US, using Juul, then when I left I had to figure out a way to keep refilling whilst away. I tried all the tutorials and watched all the videos, but always ended up having a leaking pod.\u000a\u000aThis is not for profit or fame, I was just bloody sick of the leaks and wanted to let others know how I do it to prevent them.\u000a\u000aHope it helps team!\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18K0eN4Jq44
p438
aVAny suggestions for an alternative to juul?
p439
aVI'm really digging the Peas from Rofvape. It's like $10-$15 depending where you buy, pods are sized similar to the juul but have a removable butt plug for refilling. 5 packs of empty pods are like $5 and I've been getting about 10 refills out of each pod before it turns a bit meh.
p440
aVI've had my suorin air 2 for about 6 weeks with absolutely 0 problems. I also personally know about 5 other people at my school who are using the air 2 without problems. I know it gets a lot of heat around here but as someone who has no interest in big mods or customizing anything this thing has been amazing. I usually switch pods every 15-20ml of juice (im using the solace nic salt 30mg rn but am going to try out normal juice at 18mg soon) and have never had problems burning out pods or had any leaks. Its less than $30 for the kit and about $3-$4 for the refillable pods which is much cheaper than your juul. Looks cool too
p441
aVI can refill them in under a minute but I\u2019ve done it many many times. Still in search of a refillable alternative that gives me the same experience. So far the phix has been the closest (just as good imo) but refilling them is harder than the Juul and they cost around the same price. 
p442
aVMy mother picked up a Juul because I said it was the simplest option out there. She loves it. I've taken some drags from it and the 50mg/ml is quite powerful and it tastes really damn good for a "cigalike." Really simple use. 
p443
aVRecently got a juul and my eyes are getting red. Not sure if it\u2019s the juul or me playing pubg everyday. Need tips
p444
aVGetting Juul for my dad who has been a cig smoker for a few years. Is it a better alternative and will he like it more Importantly?
p445
aV&gt;He obviously is older (60) so he probably isnt going to like the fruit flavors\u000a\u000aWhat does age and liking fruit flavors have in common? The propaganda against vaping must be working.\u000a\u000aThe juul is a fine choice for a smoker quitting, although it can get very expensive because of the pods. If you think he'd prefer to fill his own and save a good 50% (not everyone wants to hassle with that) then there are probably better pod systems out there for him, but the juul is still one of the better non-refillable systems.
p446
aVThe upside to the juul is it's very easy to use and mimics smoking.  The downside is you're locked into its propriety pods when compared with alternatives are very expensive.  If your dad has expressed interest in vaping you may want consider something like the aspire zelos.  If he hasn't, the juul is probably the closest thing to smoking, so it's worth a shot for his health alone.\u000a\u000aEdit: there's only one nicotine level.  Most vaping devices can be very helpful in quitting because you can step down the amount the nicotine.  the juul is much more of a smoking replacement than cession tool. 
p447
aVDon't vape oils. It'll give you pneumonia and possibly kill you.\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aYou might like a pod system. They're about the size of 2-6 cigarettes tied together. Some of them have a button you press that starts them and some just autostart when you begin sucking on the mouthpiece.\u000a\u000aJuuls aren't refillable, but they're popular. You just have to keep buying their pods with their juice in it.\u000a\u000aDon't buy Suorin products; lots of people have issues with them.. probably stay away from Eleaf iCares, too.\u000a\u000aAspire Breeze seems decent, it fires when you draw on it.. Atopack Dolphins seem OK, they have a button that fires them and they can fit a lot of liquid.\u000a\u000aThere are a lot of other pod systems that I'm not aware of. Maybe try watching some YouTube reviews. (Just remember that most reviewers aren't reviewers.. they're salesmen disguised as reviewers. Some are trustworthy, but those guys are few and far between.)\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aIf you really want something the size of a cigarette, you might just go to a gas station and pick up a cigalike. They're honestly crap.. with tiny batteries and not much juice in them, but if you're just an occasional smoker the low entry price might be up your alley. I know I quit smoking using MarkTens from the coupons they sent me through the mail. (Regularly they're ~$10 for one battery and one cartomizer, then ~$10 for two cartomizers. One cart would last me about a day.) I found out you can remove the back of the cartomizers and fill them up with your own eliquid, provided you have a small syringe to get it in there. (Once I did that for a few weeks and decided that I liked vaping, I gave those away to another smoker and bought myself real vape gear.)
p448
aVMonq, Corked, and KININ are basically just all in one vaporizer cartridges with their own battery, tank, and coil. So basically any pen or mod is gonna work just the same or better. I'd look up some threads with recs for pens or pens for beginners and see if anything catches your eye. \u000a\u000aOr you could also find some help on the daily questions thread. If you say what you want from the pen/what your use is, people will generally list off a few recs, just gotta give them something to go off of.\u000a\u000aBasically things like\u000a-can take other e juice/not a closed pod system like the Juul\u000a-has coils for max 100% vg e-Juice (resistance matters depending on the blend of PG/VG, affects the flavor, vaporize times, etc)\u000a-battary usage, etc\u000a\u000aA common rec off the top of my head is the Joye eGo AIO Starter Kit, but I don't personally have any experience with it, sorry!\u000a\u000aYou might also check out /r/ejuice to get better reccomendations since it's a juice focused community.

aVVaping for 2 months. Since day one, I\u2019ve had pain in my lower, side, and mid back. Might be gas/dehydration?. Wondering if anyone else has had this?\u000a\u000aHey guys. I am trying to figure out what it is that is causing this dull pain I\u2019m feeling. I feel it in my lower back sides or sometimes in my stomach. It seems to go away a little bit when I drink more water. A little bit.  But the feeling or pain is all day. From morning to wake. I won\u2019t stop vaping. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not causing me health issues but I need to fine tune something to keep that \u201csymptom\u201d away.  Again idk if it\u2019s gas or dehydration because my Pee looks fine. Maybe 18mg nic is giving me bloat? Maybe cigarette chemicals aren\u2019t completely out of my system yet?\u000a\u000aVape history if that helps: started with a JUul for a month. Switched to 70vg30pg 18mg. Then vaped 60vg40pg liquid. Then tried 12mg 80vg/20pg liquid.  Now when I tried this liquid which tasted amazing. It was giving me really bad cotton mouth. So I did drink a lot of water that night and felt pretty good in the morning for the first time. But I went through 12mg so fast. I had to refill in less than a day. \u000aJust to clarify. Before two months ago I smoked a pack a day camel blue cigarettes for 17 years. \u000a\u000aMaybe i need to switch to subohm at like 3mg or 6mg\u000a\u000aI can\u2019t figure out if it\u2019s the nicotine, vgpg ratio. Sweeteners or if vaping really does dehydrate you more than smoking. \u000a\u000aAny helpful ideas?\u000a\u000a

aVWhere can you find nicotine salt juice for sale if you don't mind me asking? Juuls are nice but way too expensive in the long run and I can't even find WTA juice.
p455
aVIf you just want a small setup for work and like MTL.. and you've been gone from the vaping scene for two years.. you may be interested in nicotine salt liquids.\u000a\u000aNicotine salt isn't salt; it's a different form of nicotine that's used in vape juice. It enters the body more quickly, so people can get a buzz like with a cigarette.\u000a\u000aWhen people use salt based juice, they usually don't go for 3/6/12mg strengths.. they go for 24/36/48mg strengths and only MTL it. There are new devices called pod systems with 2ml-6ml pods that you can refill (on most of them.) The pods easily fit into your pocket, so people take them on vacation and to work.. and they're a discreet MTL device, so you're not chucking clouds and drawing attention on your vape breaks.. and the high nicotine content means just a few drags is all you need to catch a nicotine buzz and get back to work.\u000a\u000aJuul makes the most popular one, but I think its pods aren't refillable. Stay away from Suorin products (Smok/Eleaf tier quality control, apparently.) Also, I've heard a few bad things about Eleaf's iCare 2.\u000a\u000aI think the better ones are Aspire Breeze / Atopack Dolphin (not Penguin, the Dolphin can MTL, the Penguin can't.) Sigelei and a few other manufacturers are getting into the market, too. Here's the first site I can think of that has a Pod section of devices they sell: http://www.myvaporstore.com/Pod-Systems-Ecig-Starter-Kits-s/525.htm\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aOh, and the nicotine salt juice.. (remember, it's not salty, it refers to the chemical form of the nicotine.)\u000a\u000aHere's a thread where they discuss some vendors and list another thread where other vendors of nicotine salt juices are listed: https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/7i6fww/alternative_nic_salt_companies

aVI highly recommend the juul. I\u2019ve vaping for a couple years now and have switched to a juul for about the past year. I use to enjoy building coils and using bigger mods but don\u2019t have as much time now so the juul is very convenient.
p457
aVKeep an eye out for Juul starter kits cheap - my mate got one for a buck in a Circle K in the Chicago burbs last week - he was buying cigarettes and the machine asked him if he wanted a Juul for a dollar so he did. He still hasn't opened the pack he bought. And he's been drunk at least once since then. I know, I was there.  Super proud of him. 
p458
aVThis is the new juul... 
p459
aVI really prefer juuls, but the pods are a fair distance away.
p460
aVI would like a pass that when presented to any vape shop owner allows me to take whatever I want for my Juul.
p461
aVI want a lot of juul pods and rent money
p462
aVAs much as I don't like them, JUUL may be your best bet. It's probably the easiest device to use. I ou purchase prefilled pods that you use then discard.\u000a\u000aI don't know your brother though, and what he could or couldn't handle as far as maintenance.

aVI'd absolutely agree with this except $100 isn't gonna get you that far with Juul - maybe a months worth of pods, but certainly not 6.  They do run periodic starter kits for $1 deals - my mate picked one up in a Circle K in the Chicago burbs last week. Maybe check over at /r/Juul and see if any of the folks over there know if there's anything happening like that near you just now.
p464
aVIt can be a lot to take in. I hear great things about the juul, like most people do. 
p465
aVGet him an atopack dolphin or penguin. Both are made by joyetech, are incredibly inexpensive, coils don't cost as much as the pods for the Juul. Very easy to use. Not as easy as the Juul but it fires harder and you get to vape any flavor you want. 
p466
aVI might recommend a Juul, they are about the size of a USB stick and give the throat hit that many smokers enjoy. Rather than bottles if juice they come in little pods that you swap out when they are empty. Great easy to use device. 
p467
aVA juul would really be the best bet. Or a similar pod system. They're basically plug n play. They have a higher cost due to having to buy pods, though some are refillable.

aVUltraportables might be worth a look. From reading this I think you're in Blighty so the strongest nic you're gonna be able to get is 20mg, but even at that, if you're not smoking much just now, something like a Juul pod is gonna blow your head off. Maybe pair one of them up with juice you're not particularly keen on - sounds a bit daft but if it deters you from firing it up outside of when you're three sheets and everything's out the window maybe so much so the better
p471
aVI tried to get one and a Von Erl. But not easy to find it in Germany. Maybe I should get a Juul?
p472
aVA juul in Germany? They are not sold in Europe, thanks to the TPD2, as we have been limited to juice not stronger than 20mg/ml. 
p473
aVi\u2019ve given the juul a thought but i don\u2019t know if the flavors compare to the bo, despite the shit quality control i\u2019ve been dealing with lol
p474
aVIf you\u2019re using the 1.2ohm coil for mouth to lung you could go with some high nicotine nic salt juice. 45mg is pretty standard, similar to juul levels. Nic level is all personal preference so try it out and see what feels good to you. 
p475
aVI'll be getting a dead rabbit (finally, super stoked), some prebuilt coils, and some cotton pads for myself. I'm going to get my mom a juul most likely (some type of pod device) and I've already got my dad an aio device. 
p476
aVGonna get a Juul so I can take quicker smoke breaks when we're busy at work, aka 24/7. Thanks!

aVIt just hit me that you're talking about the iCare and I was talking about the iJust. Derp.. I'm not fully awake, at the moment.. and I'm sitting down, taking breaks from Photoshop and photographing old Masonic hats I'm trying to get on eBay before 8pm EST.\u000a\u000aSorry.. My experience was the same with the *iJust 2*.\u000a\u000aI think Eleaf just makes terri-bad coils.. and stores will never refund anything that's been used. I'd just suggest you save up for another device and learn to distrust Eleaf.\u000a\u000aThe Aspire Breeze / Atopack Dolphin are things I don't hear too many complaints about. Maybe look into one of those. Juuls have non-refillable pods and avoid anything from Suorin like it has leprosy. 
p478
aVOr always have some sort of stealth in your pocket.  That's why I carry a juul around.  
p479
aVIf you want a pod system like a Juul, Aspire Breeze or an iCare 2, go with nicotine salts. 24 / 36 or 48mg strength.\u000a\u000aI think Juuls aren't refillable, though.. so you might be happier with one of the other pod systems. \u000a\u000aOh, and stay far away from Suorin Air or Drop. We get more people coming here having problems with Suorin pods than any other pod.\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aThis link has some companies that sell nic salt juice: https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/7i6fww/alternative_nic_salt_companies In the comments of that post is also another post that has a few more listed.
p480
aVI just recently bought a Juul, and honestly it\u2019s pretty cool. I still have my large 200w box mod to use at home. I have mainly been using the Juul outside of my house. The nic salts work quickly, and I really only need 2-3 puffs off of the Juul at a time. I would recommend giving it a shot.
p481
aVIt sounds great, but would you have a recommendation for something that looks more like a pen? I think the biggest gripe with Juul was that it just didn't feel like a cigarette. I copped an eGo AIO with Mount Baker but I personally didn't like the flavor at all (maybe I am just used to Hadaly and Wasp :/)

aVLast week some of "you people" downvoted me for claiming Juul was a temperature Controlled device. I present my case
p485
aVPick your dad up a Juul. It is the closest thing I've found that will satisfy the cig. cravings. Simple device that he won't have to spend a lot of time getting used to. If that works for him, in time, he may find interest in refillable tanks and mods. I purchased mods and passed on some of my mods/tanks to my son and DIL (in their 40s). The only thing that worked for them was the JUUL. I'll be 64 next month and cig. free for over 3 yrs. I think it would be a great xmas gift for your dad.
p486
aVGet him a Juul.\u000a\u000aI tried with my dad for a while with Joyetech mods and things of that nature and while he got into it, he hated dealing with burnt coils and shit like that.\u000a\u000aSince he has gotten a Juul, hasn\u2019t touched a cigarette. It\u2019s been about a year and a half now. Anytime anything goes wrong with it, he just sends it in and they send him a new one. Their chat support is great (my dad is partially deaf).\u000a\u000aHe loves it and I love knowing the fact he\u2019ll be in my life longer.
p487
aVLike the above poster and my comment, Juul. Lifetime warranty.
p488
aVI think what gets him is the ease of use. The cartridges, never refilling tanks, the warranty.\u000a\u000aI think the Juul is only like $40?? I\u2019ve noticed older people generally aren\u2019t cloud beasts and want something inconspicuous. Plus comparing an old blu to a Juul with the salts is night and day my friend...
p489
aVThe juul only has one strength 54 mg/ml. Sounds like a lot because... it is, but it produces much less vapor and uses much less juice than normal settups. A pod is .7ml and supposed to = a pack.\u000a\u000aI'd never recommend one to someone who has not previously smoked because a lot if poeple in the frat scene got addicted to them but I've heard from multiple poeple that it is the one vape that could get them off cigs.
p490
aVI see, thank you for the info.  At this point I'm willing to give it a shot.  Having a hard time finding them online...seems breazy has them, as well as the juul website...any idea why that is
p491
aVSorry for just now getting back. The Juul pods only come in one nic level unfortunately. One pod is equal to one pack of cigarettes. So your dad probably go through one half a pod per day. I recommend getting him the starter pack. They sell for $50. on Juuls site. I'm going to guess your dad will probably like the mint flavor. I wish him luck.
p492
aVWell, you can start with a pen device that has a 510 connector, so you could get other tanks to use on it and keep diffferent flavors in them. The Innokin Endura T18 and T20 are fairly popular. I wouldn't recommend an iJust because it's only for direct lung inhaling (that's hitting it like a bong.)\u000a\u000aYou can also go with pod systems. You can't use other tanks with them, but they tend to be smaller and easier to fit into your pocket. Juul / Aspire Breeze / iCare 2 / Atopack Dolpin seem to be decent and fairly popular. I'd stay away from Suorin Airs and Drops, as they appear to have quality control issues. We see a lot of new vapers come here because their Suorin pods unexpectedly died.\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aNicotine salt juices also might help a new vaper transition from smoking.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/7i6fww/alternative_nic_salt_companies\u000a\u000aNicotine salts are absorbed into the body more quickly than regular vaping nicotine. You can get your morning nicotine buzz using salt based devices. If you go with a mouth to lung pod system, a lot of people run those with nicotine salts in high concentrations. I think 24 / 36 / 48 are the normal amounts of nicotine used in them.
p493
aVThe Juul is a simple to learn and seemingly well built pod system. It's not as cheap as some of the refillable ones (pods can be pricy compared to using systems using traditional e-liquid which are often far more complex to learn comparatively, or even refillable ones which seem to be very hit or miss from my research so far), but it works damn well and still cheaper than smoking. There's also a one year warranty that I hear is very good and if any problems arise they generally will make it right in a relatively short period of time from what I've heard. Can't say many other pod systems offer warranties like that (that I know of at least). \u000a\u000aPeople aren't the biggest fan of it compared to a lot of the others because of its popularity and sadly the kids who seem to enjoy it and do dumb shit, but it really helped me recently after I gave in and had a couple cigarettes after a long time not smoking because I was frustrated with some of my complex setups that day and life in general. Now that I own this, it provides the same satisfaction if not more (it doesn't taste like shit like cigarettes do!) and has helped me avoid further temptation. Yeah I may be paying more than I normally like to on vaping (well at least regarding liquid and prebuilt stuff) but it's cheaper and healthier than relapsing on cigarettes.\u000a\u000a50mg nic salts are strong, so 3 puffs or possibly a handful depending on tolerance is really all you need probably. It's best to take it slow and determine when to stop before you get nauseous (like how you would if you chainsmoked a few non filter cigarettes). \u000a\u000aIt's a mouth to lung device though, meaning you inhale it or in lack of better words "smoke" it like you would a cigarette. The draw is very close and so is the throat hit. Direct lung setups (like what you see people doing huge clouds with for example) you inhale similarly to a hookah or bong (hate to use that example but it's one of the few I can think of) and may be weird to transition to if you're used to smoking. \u000a\u000aThe benefit of pod systems like the Juul is it's literally plug a pod in and make sure your battery is charged (in this case a simple tap or two near the top before the pod section will show an LED indicator for battery level) and you're ready to rock and roll. \u000a\u000aAn alternative would be maybe something like an eleaf pico &amp; nautilus 2, which also is going to be similar to a cigarette in how it's inhaled (or in smokers terms, the way you would smoke it) and that would be a solid beginner mod kit with more bells and whistles. It also requires you to know a little bit about what to do and not do with batteries (easy but something you need to be wary of) and you will have to change coils (and buy replacements) as well as wash and maintain the tank. You'd also need to know what to set your wattage at (generally I think its around 15-20w in that tank depending on the coil) and get an external charger as well. \u000a\u000aThe Endura T18 &amp; T20 are always great suggestions as /u/AnTi90d mentioned, those you just need to charge the battery via a usb cable and swap out coilheads and clean the tank. Swapping coils is pretty easy regarding that, Pretty sure it's just opening the tank when it's empty or close ideally or otherwise dump out remaining juice that's in there and screwing a new one in after washing it out i imagine like many other tanks. As far as telling if the coil is dying, you can tell by the flavor decreasing and starting to taste shitty. \u000a\u000aIn terms of ease of use and what I feel would work best, assuming you aren't familiar and comfortable with direct lung a pod system like the Juul or an Endura T18 or T20 would be the cheapest and best bet to give it a shot if you want a draw similar to a cigarette and minimal maintenance and things to learn about in the beginning. I would say the only thing with the juul is you have to be careful to maybe not over do it but you can generally tell when you're cravings are satisfied and nic salts hit faster than the juice you would use in the enduras or any other non nic salt juice. \u000a\u000aRegarding juice, I would say try 9-18mg somewhere in that area with 50/50 vg/pg ratio for the endura, and the Juul has prefilled pods (cartridges essentially) which make it so you don't have to worry about this. If you went with the Juul I think you would like the Mint pods the most. The starter kit comes with 4 flavors (Fruit Medley, Creme Brulee, Mint, and Tobacco) and there's Mango pods and occasionally some limited release flavors also. \u000a\u000aI'd say look into those and see how they work (YouTube can be useful, not so much for the Juul, I would say look at the official website, there's a lot of stupid shit people put up about the Juuls that may turn you off based on the content some idiots upload) and see what thing appeals to you the most and grab one offline or in a store ( vapordna.com, elementvape.com and e-ciggity.com are all vendors I've had positive experiences with and would recommend). \u000a\u000aGood luck and don't feel bad if you dual use for a period of time before completely transitioning, that's how me and my friend both quit smoking (i slipped up a few times but got right back on the wagon) and either way it's less cigarettes smoked than normal and healthier than only smoking. 
p494
aVJuul is a great device for the transition from smoking to vaping but not a long term solution. You can be just as addicted to the Juul as cigarettes, I know because I\u2019ve been there. I was happily vaping 3mg not even needing to vape any longer, then I got a new job in a big city, didn\u2019t want to blow huge clouds anymore, picked up a Juul and it ruined all the progress I made with needing less and less nicotine. \u000aAlso the build quality is absolute shit. Of course Pax just throws another device at you when it breaks or doesn\u2019t hit anymore, all their money comes from keeping you hooked on pods which are absurdly expensive for what they are. 
p495
aVYoure making a GREAT choice! \u000a\u000aThe Juul is a great place to start, easy, peasy, no mess, no fuss. and the menthol hit is fanfuckingtastic. It made it possible for me to quit. 
p496
aVI would start with something like a Juul easy and simple and will give a noticable cigarette style hit. It's a no fuss device to get started on. I went a little too hard to fast when I quit and ended up frustrated I wasn't getting the results I wanted. This led me to smoke for an extra year until I finally started really getting my vaping situation figured out. 
p497
aVI think a Mi-one is a great starter device, additionally, any podmod would be great (I would recommend the Juul personally). \u000a\u000aAlso the Endura's are good, but if you wanna jump straight into direct lung hits, those Smok Stick v8's aren't really bad.\u000a\u000aIf you want something that you can grow into, and looks really nice; A voopoo Drag mod with a Wake Tank, although that's not really a "beginner" device, but if you smoke out of a bong ever it's kinda like that, really airy and open and straight into your lungs. I would suggest the latter (if you're serious about the switch and wanna give it a chance) because nine times out of ten, you'll end up with something similar within a few months of vaping. As far as juice, that's the good part, buy a couple bottles of cheap juice that match a flavor profile that you'd like (you can get around 4 bottles for the price of one bottle if you go onto /r/DIY_classifieds, you cant go wrong with u/hashslingingslashur) get like a fruity, a cream (strawberry and cream is a really beloved profile by many vapers) and maybe a tobacco. That way if you don't happen to love one of them, you can move on to the next one. GOOD LUCK and STICK WITH IT, (it works if you work it xD )
p498
aVI haven\u2019t had any issue with mine but I\u2019ve only had it half a week so who knows. I like it more than the Juul but that\u2019s the only experience with pods I\u2019ve had. 
p499
aVOutside of the refill option (outside of opening and filling a used juul pod) what do you like better about it? I've had a juul for about the same time span as you have had the sourin, but the only con I can find is how expensive pods can be  (I've yet to try to refill any since I have a 2 half used ones and 2 full ones, and 8 coming). \u000a\u000aI was looking for a refillable option and the sourin is up on my list, but the size and shape of it made me look at a few others. \u000a\u000aI'm curious though as to what you found made you prefer it than the Juul, because it may be things I never considered or understimated. 
p500
aV&gt; Boulder Rock deal at Bombies - you get a 30ml bottle with that for $25\u000a\u000aI've considered this in addition to the Juul because worst case I can use the salts to fill a different refillable device or used pods. I wish they did 50mg, but I think 40 would be good enough and the price is nice enough to where there isn't much room to complain. I heard mixed things about the Boulder Rock though, it'd be interesting to hear from anyone who's had long term experience with one.
p501
aVPersonally I get much better hits off my drop. I have to take the stupid pods out of my Juul every 4 hits and shake the bubbles out. My only issue currently is finding Salt Nic juice that\u2019s good. It\u2019s expensive and there\u2019s so few choices/reviews. Solace strawberry hard candy is really good though. If you buy from [vapordna](https://www.vapordna.com/Holiday-Promotion-Suorin-Drop-and-Solace-Bundle-p/hpsula.htm) they have a holiday bundle where if you spend $25 or more you can get the Suorin Drop and the choice of either Solace Strawberry Hard Candy or Solace Mint for $19.99 using coupon code "DROP". That sounds weird but I copied and pasted that last bit from their website cause I\u2019m lazy but it\u2019s how I got mine plus some juice to try. 
p502
aV&gt; I have to take the stupid pods out of my Juul every 4 hits and shake the bubbles out.\u000a\u000aWeird, I've yet to have this issue. I've seen bubbles but the performance on mine is consistent regardless. Could be a bad batch of pods. I'm looking into some nic salts myself (trying to find more at 50mg than Naked's and maybe a few others) so if this kind of thread pops up again and I find some and see you in it I'll try to remember to mention what I've tried. So far I have a fair amount of pods to go through while I find what the best option on the market that's as close to the Juul as I can. Otherwise, I'll buy pods until I find one, for as much hate as it gets, this little thing is everything I hoped it would be.
p503
aVJuul or any old system. I don\u2019t have any experience, but just what I understand from those setups. 
p504
aVAs someone who uses them almost exclusively outside of a recently acquired Juul, there is no benefit. I use mech squonk mods and haven't got the money for the regulated ones I've had my eye on and I'm used to the building and safety aspects from using tubes for a good part of this year. \u000a\u000aOutside of those personal reasons regarding why I use them, there's little reason to get into them unless you do the research enough to where you're confident enough to ask maybe if what you read and learned is correct at the most. Dual battery regulated mods will outperform any single 18650 and pose any risk of venting at the same power levels, and deliver consistent power instead of a slowly decreasing amount as you vape (the time it takes is also dependent on how much power you're asking the battery to deliver). \u000a\u000aPeople who are "serious" vapers are probably people who like to tinker, have the time and know how to do so, and just like the form factor, aesthetics and things like that. They trade off a consistent vape experience (I don't find it that bad, but there's a difference for sure, and some hate it, others like me don't mind it at all), the lack of any safety features besides what's between your ears, and all the other options for those reasons mostly for the reasons I listed prior to this sentence. \u000a\u000aThe only benefits to them is that theoretically they will stand the test of time better **if** maintained properly and maybe if some spare parts are to be had once some things are worn out, besides that they generally look better than any regulated device (subjective) and right now the most of the best options for a $100+ squonk mod are mechanical unless you are willing to shell out the extra it costs for a DNA or Yihi one, and those are almost all single cell and cap at 60-70w. The only dual battery options I've seen are quite costly compared to their single cell cousins. There may be a few cheaper options (Therion 75c BF) but if I'm spending that money already I'd rather get it from a small modder and pay more for a much higher quality device than that (subjective). \u000a\u000aTldr: outside of aesthetics and squonk mods being abundantly common as single cell mechanical mods, there really is no reason to unless you're a hobbyist who is knowledgeable enough to already know the answer to this question. 
p505
aVBest refillable juul size vape?
p506
aVWhat's a good e-cig like the juul?
p507
aVI have a Limitless Pulse and dig it. It has refillable pods and a similar form factor to the Juul. I use it with 25-45mg nic salt e-liquid. 
p508
aVI second this. Almost as good as a JUUL but way cheaper to operate.
p509
aVI'm interested in finding something as small (well so far I haven't) or even just slightly bigger, metal construction, mtl draw as tight or slightly tighter than the Juul, and refillable. \u000a\u000aI have a Juul, it's not that cheap to buy pods for but with the warranty, reliability is much less of a worry than a lot of other pod systems that seem almost entirely disposable. Outside of the fact they don't make an empty refillable pod for it, I would say it's pretty much what you're looking for. I thought it would be overrated bullshit myself until I got one and I'd be lying if I didn't use it during the day as much as some of my $200+ setups.  There's sales also from time to time based on region, but you seem against it from the start and they don't pay me to sell it so I'm no salesman trying to convince you. It's popular because it works well and has a good warranty to back it up. It's a shame it's so popular with kids and those barely above age who act like kids still, because it'd be a great thing for smokers (or those tempted to go back) to use as a tool. That all being said, I'm on the market myself for something that's pretty much identical (or as identical as we can get, and yes that's shape and weight also), so I'm curious as to what you can find.
p510
aVDo you have a juul for comparison? How is the draw? The juul has a near perfect draw to me and a lot of other pod systems disappointed (myjet, icare). 
p511
aVYes I do. The Boulder Rock is a bit airier, but I find if I cover one side of the pod/airflow it cuts it down to just a touch looser than a JUUL. 
p512
aVDepends on what nicotine level you are vaping at I would say. Here is a quick run down of why:\u000a\u000aIf you have already brought your nicotine intake to lets say 6 mg(freebase), and find that you are satisfied and don't have active cravings I would stick to what you already have going. \u000a\u000aIf you are at 6mg ( freebase ) but find yourself relapsing more often than not to traditional tobacco, I would go for it. Nicotine salts allows the user to be able to vape higher concentrations of nicotine while maintaining subohm free base throat hit levels. That being said, NS also hits your system faster but has a shorter half life. So if it is the nicotine buzz you are chasing after then this is the route to go. NS is recommended to be used in MTL set ups with lower wattage and/or pod mods ( Juul, Bo, iCare, Mi-One). \u000a\u000aThere is a trend of DTL vapers who are now going back to MTL and starting to use NS, but this comes with a catch. You will be upping your nicotine levels again, if you are at a 6mg or a 3mg freebase, it is going to feel like you are vaping on air if you use the same mg NicSalts. Nicotine salts are a amazing way to convert newer vapers from traditional cigarettes. It is for those people who the 24mg on a freebase MTL set up is too harsh but they also find themselves still smoking because it doesn't feel " enough ". \u000a\u000aAlthough I will say having a small stealth MTL mod with some nic salts thrown in to it handy for times like travel, work ( limited breaks etc ) !! \u000a\u000aHope that helps answer some of your questions, let me know if I can clarify anything else. 
p513
aVThe rule of thumb is whatever strength NS you have is going to feel like  the equivalent throat hit of half that strength in freebase. NS juice that's readily available is for the most part manufactureed for pod and MTL systems since it was the journey of replicating the JUUL pods (55mg NS) that initially brought NS mainstream. That is why NS juices are not recommended to be used in sub ohm devices. \u000a\u000aNS has a much smoother throat hit. The reason you're getting the buzz is not because of throat hit but rather  high nic and NS hits your system faster than freebase. If you're looking to make your own I would suggest sticking to about 10-12mg NS to achieve the throat hit of 6mg freebase.
p514
aVAlthough not even close to the least expensive, I would recommend the Juul due to the simplicity, the high nic content (soothes cravings well) and a couple of people I met irl managed to quit smoking with them pretty painlessly
p515
aVI may be wrong, but I thought you get 5 pods filled with each of the available flavors when you buy the Juul. 
p516
aVI'd second the Juul. There seems to be two stages to vaping, the first stage is where you want to replicate the experience of a cigarette so you can finally quit smoking, then once you're off cigarettes there's the more fun stage where you begin to discover the different types of vaping, the enormous selection of juices and hardware. The Juul really shines in that first stage because it gives you the closest experience to a real cigarette, which is what most people want when they first quit smoking. \u000a\u000aIn terms of the Juul juice pods, the mango one seems to be the most popular but many of my friends love the tobacco and menthol ones too. Best thing to do is to order the Juul starter kit and see which flavors you like the most, then order more pods.\u000a\u000aThere's an upfront investment when you enter the realm of vaping but in the long run it saves you a crazy amount of money. When you go deeper down the rabbit hole it becomes even cheaper when you start making your own e-juice and using rebuildable tanks. But there's no rush, one step at a time. Vaping is fun.

p521
aVWhat do you mean make yourself sick with the juul pods?

aVThe juul pods have something like 50mg of nic salt juice in them and you absorb the nic very quickly. If you\u2019re only a casual smoker and you start hitting this thing hard after a week without any nicotine you may get nausea and feel like shit.

aVim probably gonna get downvoted into oblivion.... but if your just using it for the fuck of it try a smok stick v8 big baby beast. its something like $25 and you can use 3mg nic when you want nicotine and 0mg when you want to throw crazy cloud without getting addicted. a little more maintainance than a juul but you'll have less chances of getting brutally addicted to nic.
p524
aVIf you're not a smoker don't touch it. For reference I managed to quit a 19 year pack a day habit on 18mg/ml liquid. The liquid in Juul pods is 59mg/ml. While there's some evidence that nicotine taken in isolation isn't as addictive as when combined with all the other shite that's in cigarettes, that's strong stuff to be fucking around with. There's no point risking developing a  nicotine addiction if you don't currently have one.
p525
aVRegular juul use is more expensive than smoking in my city...still see every basic bitch walking down the street with one 
p526
aVI'd go with the Breeze, social or not. You'll go crazy searching stores for Juul kids. Breeze is great for controlling nicotine levels, using virtually any juice you want, and being discreet. Battery level is all day. I went from a 50 w istick mod vaping all day 6 mg nicotine. Bought the breeze for discrete use as I'm a Realtor and didn't want a heavy mod. Travelling through South America with it now and it doesn't weigh me down or anything. And the draw on the breeze is so easily controllable. You can take a mouth to lung hit by covering the airhole or straight to lung. Dude, def go with the breeze. Any vape shop will be friendly to your needs. Juuls I heard are decent but you have to use only their products.
p527
aV7 icare coils.  Always spitty.  I think it\u2019s just a design flaw.  \u000a\u000aI\u2019m still on my first Suorin Pod purchased on Black Friday and I think it\u2019s just the nature of these types of Pods.  Even the myjet had wick density issue, most were over stuffed with cotton.\u000a\u000aBut the experience has been pretty solid.  I\u2019ve been using Juul and Bo.  Between the two I\u2019ve found the Bo to be very consistent, but it got expensive.
p528
aVCould be a Juul or something. But without knowing exactly what it is, there's no advice to give. 
p529
aVThat's a wide range of flavors.. and you have a menthol tobacco. I smoked M Menthol for 20 years, so when I try a new vendor's juice I always go for the menthol, first.. although none of the ones I've tried ever seem to have enough menthol, even when billed as a strong menthol.\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aIf you're trying to increase your visibility, you might consider adding yourself to the Xmas/NewYear sale megathread.. along with a sale.  https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/7i7oc8/vendorsplease_submit_your_christmasnew_years_sale\u000a\u000aA giveaway here and there will also help people to realize that you exist.\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aYou should really spend a few hours adding yourself to the Juice DB: https://www.juicedb.com That's where a lot of people go to shop for juice by reading reviews and looking at their sales page. It's tedious work, but it's one of the things that differentiates large scale vendors from mom &amp; pop shops.\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aAlso, salt nicotine popularity is on the rise. People like high nicotine content salt liquids to use in pocket kits like iCares / Juuls / Aspire Breezes / Suorin "poor QC" Drops. They're mostly for a few short pulls while at work or on the go, when you don't want to rip clouds but still need a nicotine fix. Crafting a handful of salt liquids will put you on some people's radar that wouldn't otherwise bother with you.\u000a\u000a
p530
aVI think the problem that you're going to have is that not a lot of places even keep those in stock anymore. You might end up having to "upgrade" to one of the all-in-one systems that are more common now, like the juul.
p531
aVBe 18 first. You sure you meet that requirement? Why else would a non smoker want to "enter the vape world". It doesn't impress the high school chicks, they think it's douchey. It might impress the juul bros in the bathroom. Or the overweight duck dynasty bearded guys with shitty faded tattoos who you see at gamestop when you wait in line for the newest FPS.
p532
aVMost of the Juul or Suorin questions are asked by the underaged. It's just a matter of finding the evidence.
p533
aVokay cool thank you so much.  yeah i bought a JUUL last week, and after spending $75 on pods with inconsistent hits threw it in trash i bought warlock 2 days ago, and been through 2 pods.  how do i open it?
p534
aVDoes anyone have any recommendations for a good mtl starter kit? My wife has been using the Smok stick v8 baby to try to quit smoking but she is still smoking cigs more than her vape. Ii don\u2019t think dtl is working for her right now. \u2019m thinking not might be a better way for her to quit. I\u2019ve been looking at the bolder rock and the Juul. I\u2019m looking for something with an internal battery and is easy to use for beginners. Hoping to have her off cigs completely sometime next year.
p535
aVThey are still around. One popular example is the JUUL.
p536
aVYou'd be happier with a Juul / Aspire Breeze / iCare 2 or some other pod system. They all use pressure sensors to start the vape when you draw on the mouth piece.
p537
aVBeen vaping nearly the same way for 3 years - looking for opinions on Nic Salts, Juul-like devices, and the seemingly total reversal of vaping trends
p538
aVFrom what you have wrote it seems that you have nicotine tolerance(in dumb terms; you\u2019re used to the nicotine) you can see what will work for you if it is raising your nicotine level or even quitting everything for a couple days so you can break your tolerance, and get a buzz back. Don\u2019t use nicotine salts in sub-ohm devices btw. I\ufe0f like the juul a ton, nice compact, and it\u2019ll get you satisfied.
p539
aVI am always on the lookout for small devices that pack some punch - good for quick hits at work, between flights, etc.\u000a\u000aI used Juul for a good year and a half but their QC is awful. They seem to have thinned out the liquid and cheaped out on flavors as they have all seemed to change in the last year and the pods burn through much faster, if they work at all.\u000a\u000aI just picked up a Suorin Air and love it so far. I have some nic salt 35mg (NKD 100) arriving today. It has 2ml refillable pods and hits really nicely so far.\u000a\u000aI've also tried the Phix, Envii Fit, and iCare at various times and neither really did the trick. The Phix pods had good flavor but so much spitback I had to blow through the pod to clear juice every so often. The original iCare was just not good and dry hit constantly. The Fit definitely came the closest, but the refillable pods weren't available at the time.
p540
aVI have a good disposable pod system similar to Juul I want to sell
p541
aVIf you're worried about cost, get a suorin air or suorin drop. Look up "Pbusardo suorin drop" on YouTube for a good review. If you don't mind spending the money on pods, then get a Juul. The Juul is far and beyond the best pod system, he's just the cost of the pods that's a little over the top.
p542
aVIt depends on the pod mod, but they're usually 2ml or lower. Specifically 1.2ml-1.8ml. How long it lasts depends on nicotine content. A 50mg (if I recall the amounts correctly) of nic salts should last a day or more. 18mg of standard nicotine in such a pod wouldn't last as long obviously.\u000a\u000aSome pod mods such as the Juul have pods which are supposed to be thrown away after you empty the liquid. Other pod mods have pods that are meant to be refillable and thrown away only once the coil goes bad. Again others only require you to replace the coil and the pod is reusable.\u000a\u000aI personally think all pod mods are easily broken or just don't last that long. Flavor or the tightness of the draw can vary but in terms of quality they're all more or less expendable items. Therefore, I don't recommend spending more than $15 on a pod mod as I believe you just sink money into them with maybe the joyetech pod mods being a bit of an exception.\u000a\u000aOther than the joyetech penguin or dolphin they all have poor liquid capacity, and poor battery capacity. Granted the joyetech pod mods are much bigger and don't resemble cigarettes or cigars.\u000a\u000aIf I was going to buy one it'd be the Eleaf iCare2 or Rofvape Warlock Peas. That's just my 2 cents.
p543
aVI have not tried the Breeze yet, or the new dolphin from Joyetech. Penguin is definitely DTL to me. Nicotine salt on mech mod? I thought it was just for pod systems like Juul or Bo.
p544
aVHell, a lot of the guys I knew back in high school didn't even vape nicotine, just 100% VG juice for "maximum clouds."\u000a\u000aApparently juuls are the new big thing, though, so there goes that argument. 
p545
aVComing from a 19 year old, vaping hit my school hard. In my late junior and senior year tons of people had vapes or they had a juul. They would always be hitting them in the bathrooms sometimes in class. I myself have a vape but I don\u2019t do it because it\u2019s in, personally I do it so I don\u2019t actually smoke cigs as I did start smoking but quickly went off and got a vape.
p546
aVAlso had quite a dream, woke up craving a MTL hit from a JUUL (no idea why) then used my Crown III and got over it before the meeting I had to take a shit during. Noises and all, sir.
p547
aVNPR Reports That Teens are Using the JUUL to Stealth Vape.
p548
aVI've been thinking about getting a juul.\u000a  \u000aI've got a few mods and several tanks, and I think I am at a point where vaping feels more like a chore than something I am super excited about. 
p549
aVthe phix it's a bigger battery, bigger pod version of the juul.
p550
aVI wish more schools would start cracking down this hard. Although this kid was 18, the underage vapers are threatening the industry for the rest of us. Like every other high schooler has a Juul now. Most of Juul's revenue probably comes from underage users.
p551
aVWhen is it the schools place to police kids. First step should be the parents or guardians of the kids.  My parents knew exactly what I was doing and when I was doing it when I was a kid.\u000a\u000aNext stop should be the gas stations selling the oh so popular juuls to kids. 
p552
aVTry a juul or something similar. It could be the throat hit you\u2019re missing
p553
aVNever heard of juul, seems like anew type of vape?
p554
aVWholesale Juul Pods?
p555
aVThe fact you\u2019ve now reached the stage where the cost of Juul pods is a problem means you\u2019ve reached the stage where refilling is a more cost effective option, and trying to source pods at wholesale is just deferring the inevitable.
p556
aVProbably the Juul itself. Have a look around - there's $1 Juul starter kits knocking around in Circle K gas stations - my mate got one in the Chicago burbs the other day - which would obvs add to your pod budget. 
p557
aVI got one from juul directly as part of some NYC promotion. Deals come and go. Surely they'll come again
p558
aVPersonally I\u2019d buy him 2-3 Aspire Breezes, a variety of Nic salt juice, and some coils. It\u2019s $20 or so, built well, and works great. Coils last a long time and are extremely easy to replace. And that way if he loses or breaks one you don\u2019t have to buy a new expensive Juul. 
p559
aVBest juul alternative?
p560
aVDo any other closed salt systems use a set temp control like juul?
p561
aVHuh? Since when does a Juul have temp control?
p562
aVI dont feel like digging. it's common knowledge. \u000a\u000aDoes your juul shut off when your pod is dry? 
p563
aVIt doesn\u2019t, no. Every Juul I\u2019ve had will continue to fire if you use it, even if the pod is dry. I\u2019ve had many pods burn out on me when using it, especially the creme brle pods. And they weren\u2019t even dry. This has happened with my Juul and my friends and coworkers Juuls. If it does use a fork of temp control it doesn\u2019t work very well at all\u2019s \u000a\u000aIt\u2019s certainly not common knowledge though if this is true. With that said, I\u2019ll do some digging for you and see what I come up with. 
p564
aVInteresting, they claim they use a temperature regulating technology to keep an optimal vaporizing experience so there is no combustion. Personally, I believe this is less temp control as we know it in modern devices as it is a fixed temperature that they keep it at. I\u2019ve used the Juul extensively when it came out and I\u2019ve never experienced anything close to temperature regulating technology. I\u2019ve had many burnt pods before the pods even dry. If they are using any sort of modern temp control in the device, it is very inaccurate and really doesn\u2019t work well in my experience. \u000a\u000aI guess the answer to ops question would be most likely no, there aren\u2019t any devices that use the same technology as the Juul, but devices such as the Phix would definitely be an improvement to  and an upgrade from the Juul. 
p565
aVI'll bet that it just detects the volume of air being pulled through the device and then adjust the power applied accordingly. \u000a\u000aThe JUUL pods use nichrome wire which has an extremely low TCR value and detecting the minuscule fluctuations in the resistance is still impossible for most modern mods. 
p566
aVStrange, TC would avert burnt coils, yet every Juuler has experienced those.
p567
aVthe digging was done years ago.. Im not speculating here. \u000a\u000aSearch for temp control and ari atkins and juul. \u000a\u000ahttps://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S07F5jPRdF6yj5tHZjz37QYIUfQ=/2000x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3626942/Screen_Shot_2015-04-20_at_11.26.42_PM.0.png
p568
aVHow are you guys burning juul pods that use silica wick and temp control? I've Vaped through dozens of juul pods and never burnt a pod.
p569
aVAlready found it on their site. I\u2019m skeptical since I\u2019ve never experienced anything even close to temp control with the Juul. It might be set to an ideal temperature in the device but I doubt it\u2019s actually temperature sensing or using temperature control/protection. 
p570
aVlol right?\u000a\u000aI have maybe had 2 burn hits on a juul pod in my nicotine career. \u000a\u000aI switch out pods when they are no longer hitting. These kids yelling they get dry hits all day \u000a
p571
aVJuul Question
p572
aVThere's loads of cheap units and after a month of reading this sub I'm almost overloaded with all the gear. Mostly it seems to depend on how you like to draw on your vape (Mouth To Lung) MTL or (Direct To Lung) DTL.\u000a\u000aThat said, my first vape from a BM (Brick and Mortar store) was an aspire PockeX. I still love it for it's simplicity and maybe because she got me off the ciggies. I bought a replacement for 11$ somewhere off the Internet.  I saw last night a juul look alike called Boulder (Google "Boulder vape"). $10. Refillable. \u000a\u000aBottom line: save money and don't do pods. Refill your own or save thousands and jump in on the DIY ejuice. Sometimes the flavor isn't the best in the beginning but it's always going to be long run cheaper than buying juice and short run cheaper than any pod style vape. 
p573
aVAspire breeze seems to get good reveiws and be eelativiely cheap. Id 100% recomend it over a juul. 
p574
aVI jut lost my job so I can't afford and to get into DIY yet. I will be doing that once income resumes. \u000a\u000aI read that you can refill Juul pods, but not knowing anything about them I could have misread that, or not understood what it was saying. \u000a\u000aSince I break stuff (I'm a klutz) I got a lifetime warranty on my primary from a B&amp;M, but it could take them a couple of days to repair and place. I'm sure my rebuilt K2 would last that long, but I'd rather be safe than sorry hence looking at the cheapest possible, most satisfying entry unit I can.\u000a\u000aI'll check out the boulder vape. I've tried the Camel and Marlboro closed system products and after having a DTM system I don't want to go back to that. Obviously the K2 isn't one, but it will satiate my need for nic until I get something fixed. Typically I don't do warranties, but as I dropped my K2 in an ambien induced haze I accepted the realist of doing the same thing with a much more expensive system although it hasn't happened yet. 
p575
aVHonestly I never even used a juul so I actually don't know if they can be refilled. Sorry to hear about the cash flow. But for sure the biggest cost in vaping will be the ejuice. The sooner you get in on that game, the more you'll save. I bet you could get started with $30 upfront bare minimum and spend the money you would on juice on adding slowly. I get that money's tight. Definitely keep reading and consider it. Basically buy pg/vg/nic, a few flavors to start and some took to measure and you can be set for a few months easy. Hopefully someone more knowledgeable will respond. 
p576
aVI have a juul, you're only going to save money if you refill the pods, depending on what flavor you like, it is a good enough option.\u000a\u000aProblem is that the battery costs 35 bucks and then pod replacements cost 15-20$ for 4 pods, with ejuice inside. You can't really change the menthol flavored pods to fruit flavors (already tried) because the menthol sticks around (or mint, whatever, the green ones.)\u000a\u000aI just picked up a Warlock Peas, roughly the same size unit, charges in a MUCH better way (juul uses a magnet to clamp against a charge pad, was constantly picking up metal shavings at work for me, led to intermittent charging issues. The pea plugs into a standard USB port, and I like that.) You get replacement pods in a 5 pack, for 10ish bucks on the internet. The battery costs 15 bucks (cheaper if you wanna get a knockoff or whatever).\u000a\u000aBut, I like it almost as much as I liked the Juul. My only problem with it is there's no easy way to tell while fumbling it out of your pocket which end to suck on. Since I'm constantly tossing it in my shirt pocket, it falls to the side, and when I dig it out I literally gotta look at my hand to tell. If that matters, skip the warlock pea lol.
p577
aVDepends what nicotine strengths you have. To get the juul effect you need 50mg salt nic or 18mg non salt nic. But I would suggest the salt nic for best results.
p578
aVIts signifigantly cheaper than a juul, especially since pods cost so much. 
p579
aVAlternatives to refilling JUUL pod that won\u2019t give me a throat hit?
p580
aVIf you've never smoked before, jumping into 59mg/ml nicotine is gonna hurt. Literally anything short of a knife in the throat is going to give less throat hit than a Juul. Why nicotine if you're not currently addicted to it?
p581
aVYeah it was intense. As for nicotine consumption: when I first bought my Volt cig, I stupidly picked the atomizer with nicotine. Since I had already used nicotine, I didn\u2019t feel so scared to move up with JUUL, but I didn\u2019t know it was such a big jump. I seriously should\u2019ve done more research. 
p582
aVAre there any known dangers of silica wicks? Saw the thread a few days ago about ceramic coils and was wondering what people thought about the juul 
p583
aVLooking to get into vaping, just for fun. I'm the type of person who buys gum not for the flavor but to blow bubbles. the type of person to learn skateboarding for tricks, not for quick transportation. \u000a\u000aSo where do I start? I don't care about the flavor, but I was smoking a cigar with a buddy and we were trying to do smoke tricks. I'd love to do it more but cigars are awful for you, so perhaps I could get a Vape with no nicotine or flavoring?\u000a\u000aWhat brand should I start with? What juice do I buy that has no nicotine or flavoring? As you can imagine, I'm unfamiliar with brands and parts of vape. I've only taken hits off my friend's juul and phix before.
p584
aVSo-Urine-Air strikes again! There have been so many posts on these devices going south, in the last month, or so. I don't know of any nic salt pod devices that are any better. The Juul isn't great, either. I've had a Pax One for a few years, and it's still kicking (same manufacturer as the Juul). So, it must be the design of salt nic mods that is the problem. Have you considered just getting a regular e-juice mod?
p585
aVAll of these high airflow devices you guys reccomend ive tried, they do not hit the spot for me like the juul or suorin (when it worked)
p586
aVGet an Innokin Endura T22 kit. Fill it with 30 or 45mg salt liquid. It\u2019s a restricted airflow setup, runs at 14W, and works great. \u000a\u000aI have Juuls and a Sourin, so I know where you\u2019re coming from. The setup I just described is rock solid. Might be a little much, airflow wise,  but you can drop the nic slightly to offset that. \u000a
p587
aVThe thing is i dont care how big of a hit i get, i literally cannot get nic sick and i dont feel "harshness" from nicotine. the more the merrier. i can smoke 2 packs back to back, not trying to brag obviously just trying to show you how high my tolerance is. But if the airflow isnt tight like a cig it feels off. the suorin and juul hit *perfect* but ill probably go to the vape shop and try it out if they have it
p588
aVNobody hates salt liquid. Everyone agrees that it's an excellent option for smokers looking to quit. Favorites of this sub such as Bombies and Level Up make it. There may be a bit of a resentment growing towards these systems solely based on the amount of 15YOs coming thru here asking 'is Juul or Suorin best for getting buzzed and where can I hide it from my parents' but nobody is going to tell a quitting smoker other than to go with what works for them.
p589
aV&gt; There may be a bit of a resentment growing towards these systems solely based on the amount of 15YOs coming thru here...\u000a\u000aThis. \u000a\u000aYou should see the shit I have to remove in /r/juul. Place is riddled with kids posting asinine crap. 
p590
aVYa that makes sense. I was just feeling around for something like the suorin or juul bc you guys know all the new stuff and half the people are trying to sell me on a regular vape that i can guarantee i know more about than them, again not bragging it was just my hobby for so long. Pair all of this with deeply craving nicotine and sheeit
p591
aVYa but think about it. I started smoking at 16. So did all my friends. If there were juuls out then, i can guarantee we would have never picked up cigs. So ya its annoying how the jits buy em and illegal and bad for them but its better than cigs
p592
aVTrust me, I've considered this as well. I think a decade or two from now, we (as a society) will look back and recognize this revolution for what it is. Not just smokers finding a way to quit without quitting. But a generation of stupid kids being stupid in a *much* healthier way. \u000a\u000aBack in the day\u2014when *I* was a stupid kid\u2014it was burning tobacco that I got myself hooked on. The teenagers now have one massive consequence they don't have to worry about.\u000a\u000aThat said, I still don't like underage users on the sub. For one, they're just plain annoying. Useful posts and interesting content gets drowned out by inane pics of pods, or what they just scratched into their Juul during free study period.\u000a\u000aSecondly, there's a difference between being thankful they have a less hazardous outlet for their experimenting, and encouraging it. 
p593
aVThat's a way more balanced and thoughtful approach than I'd have managed. I'd be threatening people with actual physical violence upon mention of the word 'juuling'. BRB, have to go punch myself in the face for writing that now.\u000a\u000aEDIT - ouch.

aVI was going to start her out on the juul but I went to al85 smoking way less than her and thought the transition would be the same\u000a
p598
aV&gt; Has anybody else experienced this?  ....or doing something seriously wrong when I prime?\u000a\u000aMan, the iCare *was* great when it first came out.  With each subsequent re-order I received, the quality greatly worsened to the point where even looking at the iCare would shatter the built-in glass tank.  I decided to stop carrying the iCare because of the issues you mentioned.\u000a\u000aThen I brought in the Boulder Rock.  It's still a pretty damn good device for nicotine salts, but as you mentioned, the pull and flavor could be better.  I think this has to be from the silica wick, you're just going to get that much better flavor from cotton since it is more absorbent than silica.  The Boulder Rock does solve the QA issues and also fixed the iCare's issues of constant leaking and breakage.\u000a\u000aI almost picked up the Suorin Air, before deciding to go the distance with the Kimsun Slim.  In my humble opinion, the Suorin Air is great as a novelty, but I feel the hit it gives is severly underpowered and the credit card shape feels unnatural in the hand when vaping.\u000a\u000aNow the Kimsun Slim 2R.  It's different than anything I've ever tried.  I think it's because it's the first refillable disposable pod system that uses temperature control titanium wire instead of wattage and kanthal.  The first 15-30 pulls is just pure cotton taste, and because it's not silica wick like the Juul or Boulder Rock, the burn in is longer than any other ultraportable you may have used.  Here are two tips I do to make the Kimsun better:\u000a\u000a* The pods come with two clear rubber stoppers that plug the mouthpiece and airhole.  I cut the airhole plug in half, and put it back in, to decrease the draw and increase the flavor.\u000a\u000a* Remove the two stickers on the side of the Kimsun to see your juice level better\u000a\u000a\u000aAs of right now, I think the Kimsun is the best device on the market to use to Max VG nicotine *and* 50/50 nicotine salts.  Is it perfect?  No, but we're getting there.  If and when I can find a device that provides superior flavor to the Kimsun, you bet I will carry it in the store.  \u000a\u000a\u000aLet me know what you think --
p599
aVI've owned at least a dozen different devices over the past ~3 years. Everything from mech mods, VW devices, a Juul, and cigalikes. \u000a\u000aI've been cig-free for the longest amount of time recently, almost a month and a half, because of the iCare 2. I absolutely adore this device. Is it as great as a mech mod? No, hell no. Is it convenient? YES! The coils last a good amount of time if you use 50/50 juice. The cloud production is satisfying. I run Nic salt on it and it's great. I'm actually picking up a second one this week along with one for my Dad for Christmas. \u000a\u000acheers

I just purchased three After Dark flavors after switching to the Suorin Drop only a week ago and I\u2019m beyond excited to try them! \u000a\u000aUnfortunately, I am not running into the same smooth experience with my device itself. After testing various juices that I could quickly find locally, I seem to be stuck with the same issue of burning the cotton too quickly in my pods. \u000a\u000aI only switched to a mod after tiring from the Juul and its issues, and I was really hoping my solution to my troubleshooting with the Drop was just finding the right juice. \u000a\u000aI\u2019m awaiting my Bombies package to arrive, but since I managed to catch this post I was wondering if you could please advise a pod mod that I could try and snag before my juice comes? I\u2019d love to get a reliable set up working and if the Kimsun is the answer I\u2019d buy right away. I\u2019d really appreciate some insight!! Thank you.
p601
aVI'd only get the Rofvape Warlock Peas or Icare 2. The Juul is very expensive for something that's worse than every other mod in terms of battery capacity and quality.\u000a\u000aThe fact is though most of those stealthy lil pod mods break easy and cost way too much. The ones I mentioned are cheap, they work, they're basically equivalent to anything else. 
p602
aVejuice is made of PG (Propylene Glycol), VG (Vegetable Glycerin), nicotine (optional), and flavoring. It is better than cigarettes because it doesn't have the thousands of chemicals and other shit that cigarettes do.\u000a\u000a\u000aIf you don't want huge clouds and just want your nicotine fix you'll want some sort of pod like the Juul, Sourin Drop, Breeze, Penguin etc. Or you can go with the AIO like the [T20 or T18](https://www.truenorthvapor.com/collections/starter-kits/endura). There are many more AIO that's just an example.
p603
aVI've heard good things about the Limitless Pulse, if you want another option.\u000a\u000aOr, you could get a tiny mod an an MTL tank, such as the Digiflavor Siren v2 (rebuildable), Vandy Vape Berserker MTL (rebuildable), or Aspire Nautilus 2 (prebuilt coils). Alternatively, you could look at an all in one mod kit, such as the Mi One (prebuilt coils). All of the above should give you much better flavor than a Juul and allow you to use any juice you like, with more battery life to boot.
p604
aVI own the berserker personally and I can attest that it has a really tight draw if you want it. Throw in some microcoils and salts and you can definitely get a Juul like experience. You just have to be comfortable with rebuilding. Otherwise, the Nautilus will definitely go super tight too. All of the options I listed are MTL though!
p605
aVI heard something about the juul formula being patented as unique, due to its use of 1 specific ingredient which other "salts" therefore cannot use. And they have been out for a while.
p606
aVDoes this work with all nic salts or just the Juul pods with that acid they use?
p607
aVStandard nicotine is a freebase, meaning the outer electron shell is open and actively bonds.  This nic also leaves your system quickly and can be quite harsh.  Salt based nicotine is far closer to the form found in the plant and the outer electron shell is almost fulfilled.  (think noble gasses but not actually filled)  This leads to almost like a time release in your system, the nicotine stays longer.  It's also less harsh as noted in other comments, most companies hit it with a small amount of one of two types of acid to introduce throat hit.  I've vaped salt nic for about two years now from the juul to bottled liquids in other devices. I love it.  Typically you'll find nic strengths in 20,25,30,35,45,50 .  Always remember that these are not exactly suitable for high power applications.  I use a 25 in an ATOpack Penguin. 45's in suorin products or similar low watt, semi-closed loop devices.  
p608
aVThere is a local shop that sells starter kit. The pods are more widely available with different nic levels. It charges super quick, you can also refill the pods with a little bit off work. The pods sell for 25 for a 3 packs but are a lot bigger than Juul Pods. It\u2019s a pretty good system.
p609
aVit has a little docking block similar to a juul that you just put it on. the charge is advertised to last for 2 days IIRC (that isnt with heavy use)
p610
aVThis is the thing that looked interesting to me.  It's difficult to charge the Juul while out and about, even with a portable battery pack.\u000a\u000ahttps://bovaping.co/?scrollto=bopower
p611
aVThe Juul doesn't leak...and had no spitback when I used them. \u000a\u000aI smoked menthol and their menthol was spot on. I cant speak about the other flavors, I thought they were gross but that's because I only wanted menthol at that point. 
p612
aVNever had leaking problems using a juul and their prefilled cartridges.
p613
aV&gt; juul\u000a\u000aThanks, I'll check it out. I originally had a stick from Native roots that didn't have any problems. I picked up some cheapo no name carts off of ebay and they were great. Went back to get more and they were gone. Tried 2-3 other ones and they either burned or leaked. Sometimes both...*sigh*\u000a
p614
aVDid I\ufe0f just break the battery for my juul?
p615
aVYou don't say? A juul user in high school? Howndid they get into this sub!? Oh yeah ...
p616
aVIt sucks that you got bad advice, but when you take something apart you assume responsibility for whatever happens. If you look at how the juul works about the only thing that's serviceable in the battery section is cleaning the contacts which should be doable with a qtip or a paper towel.
p617
aVThe Juul will definitely work mate; the pods work out to be 59mg nicotine per ml. For ref, I managed to kill a 19 year pack a day habit on something with the same power output as the Juul and 18mg per ml. The pods are spendy tho; you can refill them but it might be a bit more fannying around than you can be bothered with. \u000a\u000aThere's a rash of pod systems out just now and also little ultraportables that you can put your own juice into. You can get bottled 50mg liquid from Mr Salt E and Level Up (I'm sure there's others by now). I don't know a whole heap about them but have a poke around for the following: ICare, Aspire Breeze, Suorin, Boulder Rock, Rofvape Peas and the Limitless...shit...Limitless wee thing that looks like a flash drive. Oh, and also /u/templetam's review of the Dolphin a couple of hours ago.
p618
aVThe daily\u2019s are what I\ufe0f use when I\ufe0f can\u2019t find pods for my JUUL (hasn\u2019t been an issue in the last 6 months. \u000a\u000aGet the JUUL with tobacco pods, you will NOT regret I\ufe0ft. \u000a\u000aI\ufe0f have been cigarette free for 14 months by using the JUUL with the occasional NJOY Daily supplement. \u000a\u000aAnd just so you know, these products both actually work because they use salt based nicotine which has a much more similar action to real cigarette combustion. 
p619
aVI know this is late but i have a solution for this if you didn\u2019t find out already. The cotton in the pods get burnt after time. When they get burnt, they taste .. burnt. That\u2019s that fire taste you got. You got to replace it at the minimum every two weeks maybe even earlier depending on how hard you use it. \u000a\u000aNow for the firing after the hit, it\u2019s because there is most likely juice leakage on the contact pads and it is interfering with the hit and keeps causing it to think you\u2019re sucking. Get a napkin and just dab it all up and make sure it\u2019s all dry. Usually when there\u2019s leaking it\u2019s a sign you need to replace that pod too. They\u2019re only $5 where I\u2019m at so it\u2019s not that big of a deal compares to a Juul pods. 
p620
aVIm an old Mom too and it WAS weird to vape a "flavor" at first. \u000a\u000aNow...i love my deserts at night...\u000a\u000aYes, there are tobacco flavors our there. \u000a\u000aIf shes not into refilling you could get her the Juul to start with. My boys got one for me. Im 3 months stinky free! \u000a
p621
aVI quit dipping by getting a juul it was great at first but they only have a few flavors that aren\u2019t the best. 
p622
aVThe frost bite juice reminds me of the juul cucumber flavor. The cucumber pod actually tastes like honey dew melon to me, kinda like the mango pod tastes like peach. 
p623
aVHard core ex menthol smoker here too... 3 months stinky free! \u000a\u000aI also quit with the Juul ...but damn those pods were going to bankrupt me! \u000a\u000a\u000aOnce over the hump of the first month (w/the Juul) I got some Strawjiki Freeze from Blue Dot and that's the one I use the most often as an ADV.  I gotta jump on that Brain freeze train, sounds like right up my alley.
p624
aVI am all about that brain freeze, and that Salty Mint with vanilla, but they almost can\u2019t compare to Brazz Chilled salty chitz from Dr. Shugarchitz, the fruit and mint blend so well on all my nic salt devices... even refilled juuls/phixs!!!
p625
aVare there any effects of using silica wicks like in juul?
p626
aVI'd try it sober first mate, drinking's gonna potentially exacerbate any feelings of nausea and if you're three sheets then you might not notice nic-sickness creeping in and stopping.  Couple of blasts of 25mg from a Juul knocked me on my arse. I'm generally 1.5mg ~40w for comparison. 
p627
aVsame exact experience with the rubi! i\u2019m extremely disappointed, as it has the potential to be the juul killer.
p628
aVI'm sick of juul. Was going to get a sourin drop with all the hype, but just found mipod. I did find some bad reviews about quality just now though. \u000a\u000a3 weeks later, you still big on mi pod over sourin?\u000aAnything that I can refill my own pods would be great. Sick of juul quality and brown cartiridges... 
p629
aVDid you check one out? Was about to buy a drop and ditch juul when I found this thread. Now I'm torn
p630
aVWhat juice have you found to be the best? \u000a\u000aSo excited to open up the world of unlimited juice flavors and not deal with the sticky finicky mess that is juul! Thanks brother!\u000a\u000aClouds are still small enough to blow in to the street while walking NYC without being an asshole?
p631
aVI've been doing anything but Naked nic salts. So I don't really have a recommendation, just that Naked's nic salts are all disgusting.\u000a\u000aRight now I'm doing some Summer Vibes by Ripe Vapes and I love it. 30mg. I also like 50mg, which is probably a better transition from Juul.\u000a\u000aAs for clouds, it's all in the draw. You can choose to be annoying or not :) very flexible!
p632
aVYeah, or 3% or 5%. I think Juul is 55mg maybe? \u000a\u000a
p633
aVJuul is 5% and I've tried eon smoke which is 6% and available in 30mg pr 60mg bottles. \u000a\u000aBuying right now, thanks:)
p634
aVBuying empty juul pods
p635
aVYou have posted in a sub dedicated to underage kids using the Juul. That puts your age into question. This subreddit is for people of legal vaping age. I\u2019m just giving people a heads up before they sell/give/trade you anything. \u000a\u000aAlso, if you just crossposted from the classified subreddit I doubt anyone would care but this subreddit isn\u2019t for buying and selling. We have a separate subreddit dedicated to buying and selling. \u000a\u000aCurrently with you posting all over reddit trying to buy empty Juul pods and posting in a subreddit dedicated to underage kids just 2 days ago (the second post your account made)...I\u2019m skeptical of your age and as I said, this is a subreddit dedicated to people of legal vaping age whether that is 18, 19, or 21 depending on where you live, though with New Jersey raising its age to 21 I don\u2019t know if there are any states that have a vaping age of 19 anymore. Still, your post history puts your age in question. 
p636
aVYou can help me by deleting your post.\u000a\u000aNo one on the sub is going to be stupid enough to sell juul pods to someone who posts on r/underagejuul\u000a\u000aSo like I said earlier, kindly go fuck yourself. 
p637
aVAlright buddy listen. I just typed in juul and clicked a sub and posted. Did not realize I posted in that underage category. Mistake, yes. Me owning up to it, yes. Deleting from that page, yes. Happy? Probably not.\u000a\u000aSo how about this, you go fuck yourself bud. \U0001f44d\U0001f3ff 
p638
aVLike I just told that last guy. I typed juul and clicked he sub and posted. I didn\u2019t mean to post there and I apologize for that. I took it down and want nothing to do with it. First time on reddit. Mistake, yeah. Which I fixed and owned up to.
p639
aVNot that I care if you believe me or not, but regardless of who post in your sub or anyone else\u2019s you don\u2019t know if anyone is of legal age. You kind of have to assume, yes? First time on reddit for me, ya. I type juul, and posted on that site, not realizing the underage part. Just clicked a sub. I owned to my mistake and deleted it. And for a further heads up, class of 2015, can be 21 or over.
p640
aVIf you were held back a year or started kindergarten/first grade late you could be 21. You\u2019re at least 19 or 20 if you graduated in 15, younger I\u2019d you skipped a grade. \u000a\u000aWith that said, you\u2019re right. without proof I can\u2019t say how old you are. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s a possibility that you are underage seeing as how the second post in your post history was in an underaged subreddit. But that\u2019s just a heads up to the users on this subreddit. \u000a\u000aThis still isn\u2019t the place for asking for Juul pods. The classifieds section is the correct place. You already posted there. Crossposting that post to this sub would have been a better idea than just posting here directly. 
p641
aVYou would think since he searched juul, he'd have some posts in the actual juul sub.
p642
aVPeople definitely make mistakes. I could easily be mistaken and you\u2019re in your 40\u2019s. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s a heads up and I won\u2019t say anymore about it.\u000a\u000aYou apologized for something that doesn\u2019t need apologizing for. A simple \u201cI fucked up\u201d\u2019would suffice which you have said and it is appreciated. \u000a\u000aAs I\u2019ve said a few times before, this is still the wrong sub. I hope you get a thread going that gets you some pods because the Juul isn\u2019t too terrible though I prefer the Phix. 
p643
aVThanks man. I actually appreciate that. I will take it off of this sub. And personally I like the juul. I have a few buddies that want refills for these, as I make my own juice. I have never heard of the Phix actually. 
p644
aVThe Phix is more reliable and more...cigarettey in my experience. Aside from that the flavors in the prefilled pods are better and the pods last me 3 times as long. I\u2019d totally recommend it. I have owned most pod based systems (Juul, Phix, von erl, bo, etc) and the Phix has been the best performing. 
p645
aVSee I smoked for 7 years prior to switching to a vape. Now it\u2019s just bulky and a hassle. I switched to the juul and really like the flavors I can put into. The charge is disappointing though. An hour, maybe an hour and a half. How\u2019s the charge on the phix?
p646
aVThat\u2019s a quicker charge than the Juul. Pod size is very nice though. Need to look into that. With me making my own I can run the nicotine high, makes me hit it a lot less. \u000a\u000aBoy do i like my pipe Tobacco.  Strawberry pipe tobacco. I know I know. Love my fruits though.
p647
aVI\u2019ve been told that the air is the better of the two. The drop is known to have loose pods that rattle a little in place. I have an air and have had it for a bout a day or two now, and I love this thing to death. Switched from the juul because I was done using pods that leaked and shit out after like 20 hits. The air is all around a solid little device in my opinion, but personally I have not had any first hand experience with the drop. I would say do some research online or watch reviews of both on YouTube before making your decision though
p648
aVMy juul won\u2019t draw but charges fine
p649
aVI've been using a Juul for a few months now and I've found that this sort of thing happens frequently. Try cleaning the metal connections inside the Juul device and on the bottom of the pod. I usually use a q-tip with a bit of alcohol. If you have a can of compressed air, you can also blast the inside of the device just to clear out any gunk that may be in there. As long as there's a clean connection between the pod and the device, it should vape no problem. Hope that works for you.
p650
aVMOST INSANE JUUL HACK (60PODS 20$) NOT CLICKBAIT
p651
aVBecause this should be titled \u201chow to refill a juul pod\u201d. Instead you took the clickbait route
p652
aVYou can add whatever you like - because salts are generally higher mg, it's not recommended to use them in big chunky setups, lower power devices like the Suorin and Juul and whatnot are ideal. If you're using 'traditional' juices, stay around 50/50 to 65VG/35PG - much higher VG than that and shit gets to thick to wick and vaporize effectively because the device doesn't have enough grunt.
p653
aVJuul is very nice. Just recently picked one up and it's super great as far as mtl goes. Pods can be expensive but you can refill pods with your own nic salt juices. 
p654
aVRip trippers... I swear his main viewer demographic is the 15 year old with a black market juul, impatiently awaiting the day they can finally hit the big leagues, and buy a SMOK!
p655
aVLast summer, I went through about a Juul pod a day. That's the equivalent of a full pack of cigs worth of nic per day. I was 150 pounds and couldn't  really afford to lose weight, but I lost five pounds over the summer. For some reason, it felt like my stomach had constricted to the point where I was rarely hungry and if I was, I would only need to eat a little to feel full. \u000aI think everyone probably has different experiences  with how nicotine affected their appetite but it definitely killed mine. \u000aI wouldn't recommend vaping as a weight  loss regimen since it will cause you to eat less and probably not get as many essential vitamins and minerals. It does however definitely work. 
p656
aVGet a juul. 
p657
aVFirst off, I'm relatively new to RTA, so thanks in advance for your guidance. A couple of months ago, I switched from Juul to using nic salts in a Nautilus X on a Pico, with pretty good results. I decided to take the next step and get a Kayfun Prime, figuring it would be even better than the Nautilus.\u000a\u000aUsing 28 gauge kanthal, I build a 1.8-1.9 ohm coil and wicked it with japanese cotton. As this is my first RTA, I watched several videos first, including videos specifically for the Prime, so I think my build and wicking were at least moderately ok, even if not perfect. On the first day, the flavor was pretty good, but by the next morning the flavor was seriously diminished (almost non-existent) so I dry burned coils and inserted a new wick. This time the flavor was pretty harsh right from the beginning and frequently had a faint burnt taste. I experimented with a range of wattages from 9-14, but nothing seemed to help. For reference, on my 1.8 Nautilus X, I would normally vape between 12-14.\u000a\u000aSo far, the Prime is delivering much worse results than the Nautilus and creating much more work, but I'm sure it must be user error. I haven't tried non-salts in it yet, because I really like the salts. Any suggestions on how to fix my Kayfun experience? Thanks!
p658
aVBest Juul replacement?
p659
aVI second the Aspire Breeze. Small and compact. Allows you to put ANY juice in it. I use 50mg nic salts. Coils are dirt cheap and last a decent amount of time. Dirt cheap compared to other coils. Flavor isn\u2019t amazing compared to a full set up type thing. But flavor is definitely better than a juul and cheaper. 
p660
aVThat's the thing though, even with the same juice, juul pods last me easily 3-4 refills.
p661
aVJuul Art???
p662
aVOK I get it. Forgive my ignorance on the juul, I'm not 15. Any reason why you can't use beads or any ojuuy more readily available form of plastic? 75c each x however many hundred you need seems like an incredible waste of $$$ imo
p663
aVNonoo no worries I\u2019m asking a weird request to begin with. Nor am I 15 I\u2019m just a creative. I\u2019m using Juul pods because it\u2019ll appeal to the current generation as apposed to everyone else that\u2019s making art with paint and paper. Trying to go the extra mile 
p664
aVWow underage juul subreddit? Didn\u2019t know such a thing existed... stay there... https://www.reddit.com/r/UnderageJuul/comments/7g93el/juul_art/?st=JAKENCAF&amp;sh=e2e662d4
p665
aVSo why post in a underage juul sub reddit? Like taking to children?
p666
aV\u201cTaking to children\u201d good one! And no lmao nice try though I put it there because a majority of juul users are underage [USA Today Underage juul use]  (https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2017/10/31/juul-e-cigs-controversial-vaping-device-popular-school-campuses/818325001/) 
p667
aVSo you were soliciting minors for their used Juul containers? 
p668
aVThe current generation meaning high schoolers?\u000a\u000aFor real though, I don\u2019t know who you think the current gen is and why they would give a shit about Juul caps.
p669
aVnot sure if this is what you're looking for at all, but figured I'd throw it out there. there's a thing called the Bo which is similar to a Juul/Phix/etc. and the tobacco pods for them taste exactly like a honey berry Backwoods
p670
aVWill do. I'll probably order one this week. I loved the Juul for travel but the shit quality control did that in. The iCare was awful. Hoping this fits the bill. Flying with a full setup is a pain in the ass.
p671
aV&gt; Flying with a full setup is a pain in the ass.\u000a\u000aAgreed. I don't like the puff-activated pod kits, personally. Too many instances of either not activating the atomizer or having it continue to fire after a puff.\u000a\u000aYou might want to look at the Joyetech Dolphin as well. I'm testing one for review right now and have so far been impressed. It's much larger than a Juul, about the size of an Eleaf Pico.
p672
aVIf you want super easy go with one of the pre-filled pod systems. \u000a\u000aJuul or Von Erl are the ones that you buy the pods and just snap them in, no refilling, wicking, etc. 
p673
aVHave you talked to her about this? Has she shown any interest?\u000a\u000aYou can't just throw these at a smoker and expect them to switch.\u000a\u000aUnless something has changed recently, you're going to get recommendations for the Juul. Easy to use and widely available - she should be able to pick up new pods at a local gas station, you may want to check before you buy anything. \u000a\u000aOnline is always an option, but Mom user levels vary widely, is that something she'd be comfortable with? Are you going to be ordering  for her?
p674
aVI've not talked to her about this... no. She would say no if mentioned. I thought a surprise attack may work. May not.\u000aI like the option of her getting pods at gas stations.\u000aThis is just something I'm thinking about at a gift for her. Thanks for the suggestions. I'm going to look at the Juul.
p675
aVA second recommendation for the Juul. Going to look now. And if it worked for you! I'll hope for the best!
p676
aVI got my gf to quit on a Juul and she eventually wanted a actual mod. She is now staying off cigs with a Super Tank mini and Ipower 80w.
p677
aVGood Luck!\u000a\u000aMy kids sort of did a sneak attack on me. Got me one for my Birthday. I did say frequently though how I wanted to quit...just never could/would. \u000a\u000aI tried a couple times but nothing ever "felt" like smoking til the Juul. \u000a\u000aI hope this works for your Mom!! 
p678
aVget the Juul AND the Endura then she can experiment :)
p679
aVThe Juul for ease of use and closest representation of a cigarette, the Joyetech Penguin/Dolphin and Innokin Endura series would all be solid options. The Penguin/Dolphin are only like $20-25 and hold a ton of juice.
p680
aVArticle saying vaping may be more dangerous than smoking. Brain damage, damage to DNA... Link says vaping but when you read the article it focuses on juuling. Either way, I don't believe it.
p681
aV"...Studies suggest that Juul devices and \u201cvaping\u201d can lead to problems  with brain development, lung damage, increased risk for high blood  pressure and increased risk for nicotine/smoking addiction..."\u000a\u000a\u005c- So it's not air and does the same thing as cigarettes\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a"...It uses a battery and contains a solution of nicotine, flavorings, and other chemicals, some of which may be harmful.\u201d ([2](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/electronic-cigarette)) \u000a\u000a\u005c- Failing to  enunciate the 5 chemicals is amazing.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a"...there\u2019s evidence that Juuls may be doing more harm than good." (again) "...What we do know is that evidence suggests they aren\u2019t totally *harmless*, especially when used by teens or young adults or for long periods of time."\u000a\u000a\u005c- then in one of the studies you read this :   "It's clear that more carcinogens arise from the combustion of tobacco  in regular cigarettes than from the vapor of e-cigarettes," says Silvia  Balbo, Ph.D., the project's lead investigator, who is at the Masonic  Cancer Center at the University of Minnesota "  \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aThey go on and on, on how dangerous juuling is, compared to breathing air, true it's not air,  but in comparison to cigarettes, this is a far less dangerous withdrawing tool\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aThis article was probably written by a frightened parent, mainly targetting parents and teens, I totally agree that juuling is more dangerous than breathing, it could even be more dangerous than vaping since 2 new chemicals are added to the mix!\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000avaping and juuling isn't ment for childrens and non smokers, if someone wants to try these things to look cool, do not use one that contains nicotine, it will only damage you!

aVPlease Stop Spreading Misinformation RE: Juul's Alleged 70% Market Share
p684
aVSure but those online shop, head shops, and vape stores all carry Juul and sometimes other gas station brands. \u000a\u000a
p685
aVI think it's telling when you look at the majority of articles that cite this information - most talk about JUUL and underage use. \u000a\u000aThese are the readily available numbers available for reporters when they went looking. And since they were looking for a boogeyman to the main point of their articles, underage use, and not writing an article about ecig market representation they didn't bother digging deeper. \u000a\u000aBecause that would require actual research.
p686
aV&gt;Nah. I'm still going to rail against closed systems.\u000a\u000aGo ahead, I don't like closed systems either. I like rebuildables and DIY liquid. \u000a\u000aWhat does that have to do with Juul's actual market share and all the misinformation about it? You're not saying you're going to help spread the BS because you don't like Juul, are you? Lol, I don't think that's what you mean. But your comment seems only tangentially related to the post unless I'm misunderstanding it?
p687
aV&gt;Call it whatever. It's willful ignorance at best. I've seen it repeated so many times in the process of googling this info that 'purposeful' seems like a more appropriate word to me.\u000a\u000aOr, ya know, the reporter Google's "JUUL", sees the stat, and then uses it. Further reporters do that, which makes those stories with those stats more likely to pop up on search engines and appear more collaborated, and boom, that's what everyone reports. You know how you couldn't always find the source of that data? That's because a lot of them likely cited other articles rather than citing the data directly. The alternative here would be spending weeks trying to aggregrate data from various sources, likely relying on a lot of cooperation from stores and sites they contacted and then extrapolating from that, to come up with a stat that, while more correct, is tangential to the point of their story.\u000a\u000aThese reporters were likely told "Hey, this is some news that seems to be trending, write on this and make it clickable. Don't spend too much time, just hit the key facts others are reporting." Most of them likely don't care. Most of their editors likely don't care. But people on Facebook share the story so they've got to have something on it.\u000a\u000aAs far as the FDA is concerned, they don't seem to have access to a lot of this data either (because it literally doesn't exist). They used the Nielsen date (which is correct, but not *complete*), combined with their focus of sales at non-specialty physical stores (at which point that data is correct *and* complete) to identify the biggest players in the relevant niche of the market they want to regulate further. Coincidentally, these are also the players they can actually regulate as far as devices, as the other major manufacturers are Chinese without US based operations.\u000a\u000aAgain, man, I agree with your premise that the 70% figure is wrong as far as the market as a whole is concerned and shouldn't be quoted on here.
p688
aVJuul doesn't have 70% of the brick and mortar market. Juul owns the market in stores where they only carry cigalikes. In stores where they carry a variety of non-pod devices and ejuices, all the money comes from repeat juice sales, coil sales, and sales of higher end mods to new Vapers. Those Vapers are the ones who started with Juuls. Pure vape shops carry like 10-20 different mods, 20-50 eJuice options, and various tanks, coils and supplies. \u000a\u000aAnd you really think they do this because 70% or their income comes from selling Juuls?\u000a\u000aSource: multiple shop owners
p689
aVAnd there are how many convenience stores in each of those 35,000 recognized towns? Towns are not boroughs, cities, or other forms of organized populace, either. So how many boroughs and cities? About 35,000 of those, too, I bet. \u000a\u000aBut the more important point from the beginning: How many convenience stores in each of those towns? How many in the boroughs? How many in the cities? 20 convenience stores to every vape shop. EASILY. 20 places to buy juul to every 1 vape shop. 10 people in line at any given Sheetz or Wawa buying tobacco and electronics, no one in the vape shop up the road.\u000a\u000aLots of sightings of juuls and vuses, I'm pretty lonely with my box mod... It's all just obvious. Yes, they are fudge numbers, but they are easy to fudge from everyday experience and simple logic. 35,000 vape shops? 154,958 convenience stores. See it from a new angle.
p690
aVI wrote 2014 for a reason. That was 4 years ago, and vape shop numbers have doubled year over year in years leading up to 2014, and no one's tracked Nationwide in a while.\u000a\u000aSure, convenience stores are aplenty. But what exactly is your point? Do you have anything beyond "I see ppl buying juuls", or do you actually have something besides anecdotal non-statistical opinion on the matter?\u000a\u000aI have been to a shit ton of vape shops over the past years and I've never seen anyone buy a Juul. I've seen plenty of packed vape shops, and plenty of people buy refillable pod systems. Does that mean my version of "obvious logic" trumps yours? \u000a\u000aLet's just agree to disagree.\u000a
p691
aV Since you like hard info, I have a few fancy numbers that I hope explain where I'm coming from better.\u000a\u000aAccording to Physicians Weekly, "*JUUL Laboratories\u2019 average annual market share of total e-cigarette sales increased 515 percent during 2016 to 2017, from 2 to 13 percent. JUUL Laboratories\u2019 sales comprised 29 percent of total e-cigarette sales by December 2017, giving it the largest market share."* \u000a\u000aAnd the competitors that are being swallowed by Juul in each and every single one of these studies?  British American Tobacco, the leader in marketshare from 2014 to 2017. You know, BIG BritishAmericanTobacco, the huge behemoth behind super popular ecigarettes like Vype. If you haven't heard of them, it's actually because they're not famous - they're just another convenience store brand sold only to vaping newcomers.\u000a\u000aThe other brands in this marketshare pie chart? Altria's MarkTen, Imperial Tobacco, and companies like Vuse and V2 Pro. That's right - literally all starter kit sellers. The big 70% market that keeps getting passed around is a who's who of nobody in the vaping industry, except for Juul. [https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/02/juul-e-cigarette-sales-have-surged-over-the-past-year.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/02/juul-e-cigarette-sales-have-surged-over-the-past-year.html)\u000a\u000aIt doesn't count refillable pod makers. It doesn't count the people who manufacture 3rd party pods to fit the Juul. It doesn't count Chinese companies or their products. It doesn't even count ejuice manufacturers. It literally only counts the brands you see at gas stations, convenience stores and Rite Aids. Okay - you say, but Juul sold over a billion dollars in 2018! That is clearly above what VooPoo, VandyVape, Smok and all of them do, right?\u000a\u000aNobody knows how much they make, because they're in China and they don't have to tell you. But do you know who bought the 1 billion+ in product from Juul? The same convenience stores, the same gas stations and the same Rite Aids and CVS-type stores that are around the country. \u000a\u000aTheir sales are from selling orders directly to the stores. Not to consumers. The sales heated up because Juul made the news, and every retailer with a brain said if these things are selling, I'mma buy some and put them on my shelves. \u000a\u000aI don't doubt the the idea that they're trying  turn vaping into a closed monopoly at all. I've tried one before - and they're really convenient, so I can see why they're successful. It's a great marketing plan tbh; if you turn the public media against your product, it gets free advertising for like a year and teens see it plastered 24/7.\u000a\u000aBut that's not really the point of what we're talking about. Juul isn't nearly as commanding of a market behemoth as they've been made out to be - and that's what I'm trying to communicate. 70% of brick and mortar? Not even remotely true. The people putting out these numbers never once looked into sales of other vape products.

aVIt could be your pg/vg ratio, 50/50 is good for the juul but not a falcon. Could also be the nic level of the liquid, which you definitely want to step down for a sub ohm tank like the falcon. I use 3 mg. 
p693
aVYeah, I\u2019ve been letting the bottle steep since 11/5 or so. It\u2019s been tasting great in my low power vapes (JUUL and Sourin Vagon)
p694
aVThis happened to the wife a year or so ago.  Then I got her a Juul.  I know they're not widely highly regarded in this sub, but for quitting/killing the fix for analogs, they cannot be beat.  Afterwards, you can get you some 50mg nic salt refills. $20 will last you a month. Best of luck bro, you got this!

aVThe Breeze and Breeze 2 are a bit higher output than most - they're about 16w compared to somewhere round 7w for the likes of the Juul, so I'd be looking at those. Nautilus AIO runs off OG Nauti coils - they'll do 70 if you live in a warm climate - I could get away with 70 on them when I lived in Miami. 
p704
aVPod wise not really, imo pod systems are 2012 tech wrapped in 2018 hype, id recomend a small mod and tank such as a pico kit or armour pro kit over a pod system. The only pod system that consistently worked for me was the juul but that seems like its got way way too much nicotine for what your after

aVMy boyfriend and I haven\u2019t smoked any cigarettes in 7 days because of Juul. We\u2019ve both smoked for about 25 years each.\u000a\u000aI like the size and convenience of the Juul. A lot of other products seem large, awkward, and complicated like starting a hobby. \u000a\u000aI bought us each a Juul starter kit with 4 different flavors. I like that the flavors are discrete compared to the sickeningly sweet stuff I smell when others are vaping. \u000a\u000aIt feels enough like smoking that we\u2019ve had no issues. We even went out for drinks and enjoyed our Juul on the smoking patio with no problem. The bar even sells the cigarettes we\u2019ve always smoked and we were fine. \u000a\u000aI enjoy getting some nicotine and not smelling like shit from smoking. By day 3 we weren\u2019t coughing in the morning. The device charges in under an hour. 4 pods have lasted me a week and I smoked 1 - 1 1/2 packs a day. I\u2019m saving about $60 a week compared to cigarettes. It\u2019s also convenient that I can buy pods at 7-11, as well as several smoke shops in my area. \u000a\u000aIn the past I\u2019ve quit a few times using nicotine gum, even for as long as 2 years, but it was always difficult. I always wanted to smoke and had cravings. While I\u2019m only a week in, this is the easiest thing I\u2019ve ever done. And I can see quitting Juul eventually. My habits are changing and I\u2019m already not as attached to it as I was cigarettes. This feels and smells so much cleaner, I doubt I could ever enjoy a cigarette again.\u000a\u000aWhen you light a cigarette, you commit to smoking the whole thing. With Juul, I take a few puffs and put it back in my pocket and I\u2019m good.\u000a\u000aFor the low cost and ease of use, I highly recommend it. I wish I\u2019d done it sooner. I wish these existed 30 years ago when my grandparents tried to quit smoking.

aVI'll be honest. I started vaping about a month ago. I tried a gas station cig alike - Totallywicked Switz2 Basic for a couple of days and it wasn't effective as a replacement for Cigarettes even with 18 mg/ml juice. Then a friend lent me a Juul for a day (approximately 1 pod). It was much better and I learned a little about nicotine salts. I went to buy my own Juul device at a local B&amp;M. They were out of stock but offered me a Breeze 2. I bought it. I tried it and I liked it better than the Juul. I used it for about 4 or 5 days and my brother decided to follow my example and try vaping. He borrowed the Breeze 2 I had and didn't want to return it. (He gave me an old 3 battery Mod he had received as a gift and an Aspire Revvo Tank but there turned out to be a problem with the mod or the batteries and it didn't get much use). So I went to purchase a replacement for the Breeze 2. The B&amp;M didn't have any Breeze 2 in stock any more so the attendant suggested Breeze 1 or Nautilus. I went with Breeze 1. I used it for a day or so, wasn't happy and returned it for a Nautilus AIO. I used that for about a week. It wasn't as good as the Breeze 2 but better than the Breeze 1. The flavour was muted. Nicotine didn't feel as punchy. I ended up returning that too and in the meantime the B&amp;M had gotten new stock including a Breeze 2. This time I got an iridescent crimson version that I absolutely love and have been using for about a week.\u000a\u000aSo all I can say with certainty is at least a week to a coil. I really haven't had the opportunity to try the same set of gear longer. But the coil seems to still be working on my original Breeze for my brother but he isn't vaping as regularly as I am.

aVI would suggest getting another juul. Back up device plus new charger. 
p713
aVim 17 and my mom hates juuls so its hard
p714
aVI\u2019m going to be buying an aspire breeze 2. I\u2019ve been vaping on a Juul, what mg of nic salt juice is equal to %5.0 that the Juul pods come in.
p715
aVI\u2019ve never used a Juul but I run the Breeze2 with 24mg salts on the 0.6ohm coil and it\u2019s solid. 
p716
aVI used a juul at their 5mg and switched to a breeze 2 using 35mg. I found that the 50mg at the breeze 2 gave me a huge headache and I'm pretty satisfied with 35mg. 
p717
aVYou don't want the same strength as the Juul. The Breeze 2 makes much bigger clouds than the Juul; the bigger the cloud, the more nicotine *in* the cloud  and thus the more nicotine you get per drag. The highest you want with the 1.0ohm coil is 35mg and for the 0.6ohm you want no more than 20mg, but if you can find nic salts between 12-18 somewhere that could suit it a little better. I have the Breeze 1 and the 0.6ohm coils make pretty decent sized clouds.
p718
aVSuggestions for Juul alternatives?
p719
aVI have tried Juul, Breeze, Breeze 2 and Nautilus AIO and I prefer the Breeze 2. Breeze 1 is weaker, less flavourful and less vapour. It has a smaller battery, so need to be charged sooner.\u000a\u000aNautilus doesn't have sub ohm coils so I found the vapour weaker, nicotine and flavour more muted and it wasn't as satisfying.\u000a\u000aI have not tried the Spryte but it has less battery capacity and I think doesn't take subohm coils. Worth checking those points out if they're important to you.\u000a\u000aJuul has limited flavours, less power, proprietary battery charger and the nicotine hit less punchy. \u000a\u000aI recently started vaping and unless your best friend is a vape hobbyist with a collection of prominent devices to let you try out, you'll just have to take a leap and find your happy place with trial and error. I think the links on the sidebar are a helpful starting point, like the Anthony Vapes recommended list and reviews but between similar devices, you just have to wing it at first. 
p720
aVWell, we didnt really pick up cigs in our youth, I got into it on my first job because it was the only proper break you got (paramedic). But sure, no hard feelings. Is there a Nicotin free version of the Juuls products?
p721
aVYeah, a bit exaggerated, to say the least. I'm not a fan of Juul, or any of the nic salt pod devices. But, this is a bit much.
