VI tried a free one a year or so ago, among the worst juices I ever tasted was their rendition of tobacco. You hear the phrase licking an ashtray used before, this literally tasted like what I imagine it would be like. Even if it tasted good, it was still a shitty device. Basically a joye 510 (we're going back in time now) with a few changes and proprietary cartridges or whatever the hell you'd call them. It's old technology, that gives you a terrible experience overall. \u000a\u000aLike most big tobacco owned e-cigs (Mark Ten, Blu) they're I assume, still outdated, terrible flavor options, over priced, and almost pointless to use versus a pod system (Juul, Phix, Bo, Myjet, Dolphin, Penguin, the list goes on).

aVI feel like it's become an epidemic. I go to a public school in a good neighborhood and you can find somebody vaping in every bathroom of the school during the passing periods. I've heard schools in lower end neighborhoods have it worse, but I've heard about the same things happening at private schools as well. During finals week there were 15 kids in one bathroom just vaping and hanging out. The school sends out emails about vaping every week. Seems like everyone at the school bought a juul or a phix because they thought it was cool and then got addicted to nicotine.
p2
aVPhix cant take multiple or long hits
p3
aVLooks like the phix is in, your Phix wasn\u2019t really phixed.
p4
aVRemember That Everyone On This god forsaken forum hates anyone who wants to ask them instead of googling it themselves. If you're looking for an amazing cigalike look at the phix by mlv, the juul from pax labs, or the warlock p2 by rof. Good luck with the karma my guy!!
p5
aVThe Juul and Phix are well regarded in this current day and age. Neither are technically refillable, I know it's possible on the Juul, I haven't tried. \u000a\u000aThe pods could be cheaper that's for sure, but the great warranty they offer is why I chose it as my first pod system. I'm still researching refillable pod systems that are as close to the Juul as I can get in terms of size, weight and if possible customer service, so I can't really speak much on those. \u000a\u000a
p6
aVMi-pod is very loose draw, so it might be effective in achieving the cig feel. I\u2019d recommend something like the Juul or Phix personally. The SMPO kit has the closest throat hit to a cig and the nic hits you like a truck.  I\u2019d definitely get a small cigalike with nic salts to help you quit cigs. 
p7
aVGreat, an opportunity to hop on my alt account and talk shit.\u000a\u000aJuul/Ploom is one of the oddest birds i've encountered. I was at the Miami show a month before they launched and tested them out and put in a small pre-order. I've had them at all locations since launch and they've been nothing short of a nightmare of a company to work with. They routinely take months to fill orders and have never, ever caught up to the demand. Sure, its cool you have a hot product and all, but they've seemingly done nothing to support their retailers. Its rumored they do this on purpose to drive people to their site for orders, but even on the site they have delays and backorders. If you don't want to sell them in shops and want to just sell online, JUST TELL ME SO. I'm perpetually stuck in a spot where I can't tell them to "fuck off" because customers are beating down my door looking for pods. I don't know what they put in those pods, but Juul customers are like rabid lemmings looking for their fix, so i'm forced to keep stocking it. I just have to put in a $30k order and hope that they'll show up in under 3 months.\u000a\u000aI was glad that Phix and Von Erl converted a few of those customers, but still the demand is high. As a company with so much rolling in, I find it astounding that they need to do a round of fundraising to finance whatever they're doing. \u000a\u000aHere's an idea Juul: If you need to raise money, how about selling some fucking product? You've got endless PO's but you can't get your supply chain together after a year? \u000a\u000aI'm well aware that i'm the odd man out when it comes to financial and investment strategy. The correct thing to do is ignore your fundamental business and make up a bunch of fluffy optimistic numbers and get a bunch of VC whales to bankroll whatever hair-brained project you shat out. Then, you funnel out funds into bonuses and salaries until the money dries up and you do it all over again. Maybe i'm reaching here - - i'm reaching.\u000a\u000aAnyway, i'm jealous of Juul, that they can make a product so hot it doesn't matter if they fulfill it because people will line up and wait until they're goddamn good and ready to put it out. I wish I had that kind of product. Until then, i'll begrudgingly fork over cash and wait like a good little bitch for them to send me product.
p8
aVI was waiting for someone to jab me on this.\u000a\u000aVaping on a plane is definitely a bad idea. Not only does it make vaping look worse than it already is (can it get worse?) but it can also ding your wallet. IIRC, its a $2500 fine if they catch you.\u000a\u000aHowever, I take heavy precautions when I do it. When I see a lot of people vaping in places they shouldn't, they make **no effort** to conceal the vape. They exhale normally as if they aren't capable of holding it in and exhaling slowly, or they simple don't care and are authentic douche nozzles. \u000a\u000aWhen I vape at 30,000 feet, I take great care and preparation to position myself for full concealment. I put my sunglasses on and envelop myself in a cocoon using the provided $0.25 fleece blanket. I then nod to the side as if i'm asleep. Little do they know i'm actually awake (haha!) and preparing to strike. I've already secured the Von Erl / Phix / Juul in my hand deep inside the cocoon I ready it for action. I wait for the precise moment that the stewardess is walking away from me into the galley and bring it to my mouth, drag, and hold. The hold is the important part and where most people fail. You don't need to exhale like you normally would. The exhaust is what gets  you caught, and you need to hold that in. Finally, engage in a series of short exhaust puffs **through the nose**. This is key. Between these pulses, you inhale 30% more than you exhaled. This seems to reduce the amount of vapor until it's virtually nothing. Additionally, you want to keep your window closed. Light rays will show the vapor and get you nicked. In a pinch, you can also use the aforementioned $0.25 fleece blanket to exhale into and reduce the vapor further.\u000a\u000aIn closing, I know plane vaping is wrong, but with the effort I put into concealment I am certain nobody is aware of what i'm doing and i'm not contributing to the negative perception of vaping. 
p9
aVVery similar experience here as well. I\u2019ve been Vaping for 5 years and have started used everything from cigalikes to high end mech mods and attys. I was also weaning off it getting a bit tired of the hobby (time consuming and $$$$) and the Juul got me hooked instantly. It reminded me of why I started vaping and the ease of use and quick portable nic fix keeps me using it. \u000a\u000aI\u2019ve since used a handful of similar systems but they all fall a bit short in some way. I recently got to try a phix last week and it may very well be the closest thing to a Juul if not on par with it. The downside to me is the device is considerably bigger and the pods require tools to pull apart. I love that it uses magnetic pods since the Juul pods become loose over time. I really wish someone combine the 2 devices and created one with easy to refill pods. The Juul pods last me about 4 refills so that helps even out the costs. Even if they were cheaper however, I\u2019d still opt to refill since there are so many better nic salt juices out there (ex flavor chaser). 
p10
aVI've heard great things about the Juul, but haven't tried it yet.  I tried the Von Erl, the Limitless (Plyrock) Pulse, and the Phix.  Von Erl died after a month.  Pulse has pods you need to fill yourself. Not too difficult but adds a bit of mess and complexity.  Phix is little more econonomical then Juul.  Phix pods hold a little more than the Juul pods and are 50mg of nicotine. For on the town and in the car,  I use the Phix.  If you are willing to deal with coil replacements and e-juice refilling, the Aspire Breeze works pretty good with some 25mg nicotine salt e-juice.
p11
aVI've used the following:\u000a\u000a* **Suorin Air**  - refillable 2ml pods are nice. One went bad on the 2nd fill, but the other 2 I've tried lasted longer. Lots of posts about these failing. So far so good but I want to find a replacement.\u000a\u000a* **Phix** - I liked this device a lot, and really enjoyed the Butterscotch Tobacco but the pods spit back and leak to the point I was constantly blowing through it to clear juice before using.\u000a\u000a* **iCare v1** - hated this, constant dry hits and just bad performance.\u000a\u000a* **Envii Fitt** - this was pretty nice. Good variety of flavors, though the pods did leak some. Might try it again with refillable pods.\u000a\u000a* **Juul** - I used Juul for a year and a half but their QC is garbage, they seem to have changed the flavors some, and the popularity with high school kids means pods can be hard to find.\u000a\u000a* **Innokin Pocketmod** - So far this is my favorite of the bunch. Solid build, bulkier than the others but the 1.2ohm coils work well with nic salts. Will buy another.\u000a\u000a\u000aI also want to try the Fuchai v3, Warlock Peas, and Kimsun Slim 2R.
p12
aVI can refill them in under a minute but I\u2019ve done it many many times. Still in search of a refillable alternative that gives me the same experience. So far the phix has been the closest (just as good imo) but refilling them is harder than the Juul and they cost around the same price. 
p13
aVQuit smoking this week again. I\u2019m 65 years old, pack a day since 18 smoker. I found the pod system (phix) is good for taste and feel of a cigarette but doesn\u2019t supply the needed amount of nicotine. So I keep a mod on the side with high nicotine level juice. Between the two I fight off the urge to buy paper cigarettes. Next step refill the pods with stronger juice.
p14
aVI didn't enjoy the coils TBH, when they worked they worked well but that was limited to a day or two for me.  I'm sure my vaping style has something to do with that but how much I can't honestly say.  If you're not a heathen like me and rip them I think you'll have more success. What I can tell you is the Nautilus 2 was more reliable but the flavor was far better in the Amor NS.  The box itself wasnt bad, in a bind it made for a great bottle opener too.\u000a\u000aEDIT: I'm using a Suorin Drop now and a Smok  Infinix.  The Drop hasn't been a problem at all, I get a few fills on the pods and no catastrophic incidents.  The Infinix is a sample, it's Smok's answer to the Phix. I have been vaping CRFT salts lately, their mint is a spearmint and that just tickles me. 
p15
aVVery good note. Wasn't a fan of my pulse, refilled my phix once in a while but now my Suorin Air is acting up. Thinking maybe to get a mipod
p16
aVjust got a phix recently and when i go to draw it blinks and nothing comes out. Help? 
p17
aVWhen you say 'only' 5% remember that's 50mg/ml. The Phix only outputs something like 10w but even when we only had ego pens and MVP2s, the strongest shit generally available was 36mg. Not saying it's a good or a bad thing, but don't underestimate it.
p18
aVOk I did some research and from their site:\u000a\u000aEach PHIX pod contains 1.5mL with 5% nicotine by weight, approximately equivalent to 2 packs of cigarettes or 400 puffs.\u000a\u000aNot sure how that compared to normal vape but I'd normally go through a tank a day which I assume is around the same ?
p19
aVI am always on the lookout for small devices that pack some punch - good for quick hits at work, between flights, etc.\u000a\u000aI used Juul for a good year and a half but their QC is awful. They seem to have thinned out the liquid and cheaped out on flavors as they have all seemed to change in the last year and the pods burn through much faster, if they work at all.\u000a\u000aI just picked up a Suorin Air and love it so far. I have some nic salt 35mg (NKD 100) arriving today. It has 2ml refillable pods and hits really nicely so far.\u000a\u000aI've also tried the Phix, Envii Fit, and iCare at various times and neither really did the trick. The Phix pods had good flavor but so much spitback I had to blow through the pod to clear juice every so often. The original iCare was just not good and dry hit constantly. The Fit definitely came the closest, but the refillable pods weren't available at the time.
p20
aVAny pod system you use with pre filled pods will only last you as long as you use it. Fill your own pods are good but the coils in them don't last very long if you chain vape them. Fillables are going to cost more dependent on juice. Pre filled pods are very expensive if you use them a lot because pods run dry. The phix has the largest pods I've used for pre filled. So that's my go to for a pre filled system. The suorin drop is my go to for fill your own. 
p21
aVUnfortunately, what else is out there in that category? The Phix?\u000a\u000aI *really* liked the Joyetech Dolphin, but it's hardly in the size class with the Peas. Basically the size of your standard configuration.
p22
aVthe phix it's a bigger battery, bigger pod version of the juul.
p23
aVIt depends on a lot of things. Do you want something that is similar to a cigarette or do you want something that will give you more of a hookah experience? Does size matter? Do you want simplicity or are you cool with adjusting/fiddling with things? Do you have a budget in mid? \u000a\u000aThe joyetech ego AIO is a solid device. It\u2019s a smallish all in one stick shaped/pen style battery and it performs very well.\u000a\u000aThe Phix is a really solid pod system (sort of a cigarette sized, flash drive shaped) device that feels as close to a cigarette as I\u2019ve found in a device.\u000a\u000aIf you want something that will perform like a hookah will, the istick pico and the super tank mini will be a good combo though it will require a separate battery. It can charge with USB though which is nice. You have adjustments and such that you can make to make it perform more like how you want it.\u000a\u000aThe istick pico and the nautilus 2 will give you a solid cigarette type inhale and will perform well too. \u000a\u000aHope I\u2019ve helped a bit, if you have more questions I\u2019ll be more than happy to help out and answer any more questions I can answer! 
p24
aVInteresting, they claim they use a temperature regulating technology to keep an optimal vaporizing experience so there is no combustion. Personally, I believe this is less temp control as we know it in modern devices as it is a fixed temperature that they keep it at. I\u2019ve used the Juul extensively when it came out and I\u2019ve never experienced anything close to temperature regulating technology. I\u2019ve had many burnt pods before the pods even dry. If they are using any sort of modern temp control in the device, it is very inaccurate and really doesn\u2019t work well in my experience. \u000a\u000aI guess the answer to ops question would be most likely no, there aren\u2019t any devices that use the same technology as the Juul, but devices such as the Phix would definitely be an improvement to  and an upgrade from the Juul. 
p25
aVI would never recommend the phix to anyone. It leaks like a stuck pig and pods taste burnt when juice level gets to about half way.

aVLooking to get into vaping, just for fun. I'm the type of person who buys gum not for the flavor but to blow bubbles. the type of person to learn skateboarding for tricks, not for quick transportation. \u000a\u000aSo where do I start? I don't care about the flavor, but I was smoking a cigar with a buddy and we were trying to do smoke tricks. I'd love to do it more but cigars are awful for you, so perhaps I could get a Vape with no nicotine or flavoring?\u000a\u000aWhat brand should I start with? What juice do I buy that has no nicotine or flavoring? As you can imagine, I'm unfamiliar with brands and parts of vape. I've only taken hits off my friend's juul and phix before.

aVPhix Acting Weird
p29
aVPeople definitely make mistakes. I could easily be mistaken and you\u2019re in your 40\u2019s. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s a heads up and I won\u2019t say anymore about it.\u000a\u000aYou apologized for something that doesn\u2019t need apologizing for. A simple \u201cI fucked up\u201d\u2019would suffice which you have said and it is appreciated. \u000a\u000aAs I\u2019ve said a few times before, this is still the wrong sub. I hope you get a thread going that gets you some pods because the Juul isn\u2019t too terrible though I prefer the Phix. 
p30
aVThanks man. I actually appreciate that. I will take it off of this sub. And personally I like the juul. I have a few buddies that want refills for these, as I make my own juice. I have never heard of the Phix actually. 
p31
aVThe Phix is more reliable and more...cigarettey in my experience. Aside from that the flavors in the prefilled pods are better and the pods last me 3 times as long. I\u2019d totally recommend it. I have owned most pod based systems (Juul, Phix, von erl, bo, etc) and the Phix has been the best performing. 
p32
aVSee I smoked for 7 years prior to switching to a vape. Now it\u2019s just bulky and a hassle. I switched to the juul and really like the flavors I can put into. The charge is disappointing though. An hour, maybe an hour and a half. How\u2019s the charge on the phix?
p33
aVNo problem dude. Hope things go well and if you end up with the Phix I hope you enjoy that! 
p34
aVMy phix hits for 1-3 seconds then the light slowly dems and the hit stops... any solutions of ideas?
p35
aVI\ufe0f don\u2019t know what that other guy is talking about lol but this is my 4th phix... the last three made I\ufe0ft through 50 pods average or so but this one is on pods 20 (guesstimate). I\u2019ve never had a problem like this though... it\u2019s as if the hit is perfect and it\u2019s working fine and 2 seconds in the light slowly dims and the hit fades out to no draw at all
p36
aVBe careful with cleaning using isopropyl alcohol. From what I can tell the phix draws its airflow from the depths of mordor, or through the bottom of the pod, so if you\u2019re cleaning those contacts you might end up sucking in some isopropyl alcohol.
p37
aVnot sure if this is what you're looking for at all, but figured I'd throw it out there. there's a thing called the Bo which is similar to a Juul/Phix/etc. and the tobacco pods for them taste exactly like a honey berry Backwoods
p38
aVHELP MY PHIX IS BEING WEIRD
p39
aVDo less drugs so you remember how old you arw and how your phix works.

aVWas about 19 or 20 and hated the fact that I constantly smelled of smoke and hated that I woke up every morning coughing and wheezing until I had a cig. Went out to a Gorilla Vapes shop near me. Spent about $80 on an ego style battery and a kanger Aero or something like that. Basic MTL setup with coil heads. Used it for a month or so and then the cigarette withdrawal hit me like a truck and was hacking up goo. Went right back to cigs to not feel like shit. Fast forward 3 years or so and there I was trying to get my life in check. Basically hated myself every time I finished a cigarette. Constantly told myself that this is my last pack until I bit the bullet and spent around $70 on a smok G150 starter kit and some juice. Still smoked cigs but I started vaping and slowly got off the stinkies and started feeling so much better health wise. Went through about 2 weeks of wheezing and congestion but got through it by diving head first into this rabbit hole. Bought myself a Goon RDA, a Therion 166, bunch of wires and prebuilts, and a bunch of juice as well as a Phix and then an Aspire Breeze down the line to help with the strong urges every now and then. Now I fucking despise cigs and I only have one if I\u2019m plastered drunk and all my batteries are dead. Even then I can\u2019t even finish the whole thing without feeling sick to my stomach. Good reminder to never buy another pack haha. \u000a\u000aNow I have a bunch of atomizers and juices and my new addiction is chasing flavor. Which I STILL can\u2019t find my happy place with haha.
