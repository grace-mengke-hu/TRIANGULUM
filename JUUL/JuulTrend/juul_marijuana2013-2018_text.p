VWhat to do with ~5 ml "ejuice", with 1.5 grams of dabs in it?\u000a\u000aHello fellow stoners,\u000a\u000aMy dealer threw in 2 small bottles, roughly half way full, of thc ejuice with my last purchase. He claims they have 1.5 grams of dabs in each. He uses it by putting it in Juul cartridges, and a few puffs is all you need. I don't have any way to measure the amount of "ejuice/tincture", and I don't have any small ecig tanks to use it with. He made it with pg, pg 400, and pg 200.\u000a\u000aWhat are some other ways to consume this? Can I use it like a tincture, and take it orally or sublingually? \u000a\u000aAm I better off selling it, and sticking to my real dabs? \u000a\u000aCould I make "thc pills" with it?\u000a\u000aThanks for any input

aVDoes juuling affect how long thc is in your system?\u000a\u000aSo pretty much I have a drug test in 2 weeks, so I haven't been able to smoke any weed (usually hit my cart before bed every night). Over the last couple days  I've been exercising more, drinking more water, and taking detox pills to help me past the test. However I've also been juuling to help supplement my urge to smoke weed. Ive looked online and can't really find anything on what nicotine dose in the process of getting thc out of my system. I know typically juuls make people pee/poop more often, but I fear they may slow down the process because you are adding more "toxins" into your body. Dose anyone have a clue how juuls affect getting thc out. Thanks

aVPurely anecdotal but I notice if I have a pen and juul that they seem to diminish each others effects. If your test is in two weeks and your not a chronic smoker you should be fine. Detox pills  and chugging water won't do anything as thc clings to fat in your system, but keep exercising for now and stop a few days before the test

aVOk. So you're using a topical? Some sort of CBD cream or lotion? If ingesting or smoking weed helps you. Then, try smoking or eating the CBD. There is CBD flower, that looks like really bad weed, that you can smoke and has zero thc. There is also CBD distillate and isolate you can put in a vape pen and smoke. Finally there is cbd vape juice you can put in a juul or mod battery. As for edibles, there are the same type of options as edible weed. There are also tinctures that have up to 5000mg of CBD. You can mix it in a drink or just drop on your tongue. \u000a\u000aI'm not a big fan of topicals for pain relief. Especially if ingesting or smoking weed helps. First of all, topicals are usually pretty low dosage. So you're not getting much cbd per application. 2nd, eating and smoking gets the cbd into your system, way faster and isn't as much of a time release as topicals. More of an punch of relief all at once. \u000a\u000aI'm telling you. The THC isn't what's helping. You may be enjoying the feelings of euphoria. But it's not what is relieving your pain.

aVDoes anyone know where I can get juul pods that will vape oil I ordered some put they won\u2019t hit with oil in them\u000a\u000a
p6
aVWell i just want to get a little at first to see how strong it is.\u000aI was also thinking of filling up the juul with it if that even works.

aVThe JUUL effect \u000a\u000a\u000a(patent pending)

aV"Every kid from middle school to high school has a Juul."  \u000a\u000aOk, buddy. 
p9
aV$7 PACK OF 4 JUUL PODS\u000a\u000a

aVI hope not. I havent used my juul at all yesterday or today since i took the detox. Ive been wanting to use it but I\u2019ve been afraid it\u2019ll mess up the whole process 
p11
aVI decided to leave my dab cartridge at home, didnt wanna risk it. brought my juul even though i told myself i was gonna quit...oh well, a 12 day trip to europe isn't the best time to kick nicotine. 
p12
aVDeferred sentencing program for mip of marijuana\u000a\u000aI\u2019ll make this quick.. so I got an mip for marijuana and I am currently going through the deferred sentencing program and I just want to know if they do random drug tests and if so do they test for nicotine. I honestly don\u2019t plan to do anymore drugs.. atleast for a long while unless an opportunity comes up like if a friend wants to do something, but otherwise I don\u2019t plan to do anything else in the mean time. The nicotine testing is really my main concern I juul a decent amount and if they popped a surprise test on me I would honestly be screwed \U0001f602. And this is also only my first offense.
p13
aVI don\u2019t chew or smoke cigs there ass juul is way better \U0001f644 but anyways yea it\u2019s is my choice which I choose to use young, oh well short and fun life over long and boring, of course I am smart about what I do and how often I do them. as far as age I\u2019m 18 and the legal age to use tobacco is 21 and I\u2019m from Oregon if that helps at all. I searched high an low but couldn\u2019t find any information on wether they surprise test so I\u2019m honestly assuming they don\u2019t but if you happen to know other wise that would be great and I\u2019ll drop everything. And as far as smoking weed goes I don\u2019t fuck with that rn to much of a pain in my ass to find the right timing to do that shit, and it\u2019s even harder to get out of my system fast enough.
p14
aV^^^true shit well I\u2019ll keep my nose clean for the most part I might dabble like once or twice with drugs but not gonna even get back into my old ways. So much wrong with what I did before \U0001f644. Thanks for the advise tho gonna stay clean and I actually decided I\u2019m selling my juul now so all gonna be good \U0001f64f
