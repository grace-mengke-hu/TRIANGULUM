VGo hard and get yourself a vicious ant duke or an axis vapes m17 and for a tank a taifun gt3 or kayfun prime. On a more serious note it depends what you want. If you want something that feels like a cigarette sourin air and something bigger and badder if say no clue.

aVSuorin Drop\u000a\u000aSo recently I picked up a Suorin Drop. And it's the best thing ever. Better than the air in my opinion. With the Naked Salt Nic Juice, it's incredible. But I have one problem with it. Everytime I fill it there's these stupid air bubbles right on the fill holes. And Everytime I try to stick the juice dropper in to fill it, the juice/air bubbles pushes it back up and it leaks off the side with absolutely none if it getting actually filled. And I can't pop the stupid bubble either. Advice?

aVQuestion about Salted Juice and these new Pod Mods\u000a\u000aNew to the sub.. this is my first post..\u000a\u000aBeen vaping for years and started with an e-go.. went through my mech stage and moved to box mods.. but I just picked a Suorin Air to be a little more discreet about things.. I picked up some salted juice from NAKED and it\u2019s 35mg (I use a 3mg on my Hexohm)\u000a\u000aIs this 35mg technically like vaping 35mg from an E-go pen? I used to vape a 12mg and worked my way down to a 6mg on the pens.. are these new pod mods pretty much e-go pens in disguise?
p4
aVWell anything that has proprietary pods prefilled with juice will add up, cost wise, over time. The breeze, icare, and sourins all allow you to use your own juice for refilling which will greatly reduce your costs. I would also recommend checking out the mi-pod and mi-one which are great little devices. Refillable and relatively inexpensive with positive reviews. Element vape has both models priced at around 25 bucks right now which is a great deal. The mi-one takes a great many types of small aio coils so you would have no trouble finding them. \u000a\u000aGood luck! 
p5
aVHow is the iCare 2? I\u2019d like to pick one up but the low price makes me worried it\u2019ll shit the bed after a week like my Suorin Air did.
p6
aVHave dropped my sourin air in the snow 6 times so far this winter. Slick little thing slips out even when I am focused on holding it. Hands get too cold! It still works like a charm though.

aVHow's the Suorin Air?
p9
aVCheck out suorin air/drop. Both are really small and have been really nice for on the go vaping for me 
p10
aVYou're not really supposed to use salt nicotine e juice on a rda or other sub-ohm device. This is because usually too much power is running through it for high concentrations of nicotine and you need to be careful about overdoing it. Salt nicotine e juice are meant for devices like the sourin air, juno, juul, etc. You can find many of these devices in vape shops or online. The key difference between one of these devices and your rda is that the ohms (resistance) is much higher and the power is much power. This let's the device have a harder pull so it feels more similar to a cigarette. Useful for people trying to quit. I would not recommend using salt nicotine e juice on an rda, that just sounds like trouble if you ask me. 
p11
aVI dropped my Suorin and now every time I take a hit there is a really loud consistent crackling sound, any ideas on what happened?
p12
aVIt's a suorin drop. It's basically a huge upgrade on the suorin air, both being mouth to lung devices that work best as stealthy lil nic monsters.
p13
aVWhere can I get a Vaporesso Aurora?\u000a\u000aEvery website is out of stock out them, and saying they won't restock them. \u000a\u000a\u000aThey seem pretty cool, and all my roommates have Juuls, Breeze's and Sourins. Meanwhile I have my mod and it seems kinda out of place when we're all hanging out.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI've found one place that has them for like $35 but MSRP is $25 I'm pretty sure.\u000a\u000a\u000aIf you guys know where I could get one, I'd really love to know!

p15
aVDizziness with regular vape question\u000a\u000aSort of a noob here, but I've got a T-priv with 3mg juice and a Cleito 120, and when I hit it more than 4 or 5 times in a row anywhere from 85w to 120w I get somewhat dizzy, lights get super bright and I pretty much have to sit down. \u000a\u000aIf I use a low wattage vape such as a Juul, or a Sourin Drop, which both use very high nic juices, I don't get this dizziness.\u000a\u000aThis happens even with a fresh coil, which makes me wonder, is it the nicotine or is there something else going on? Has anyone experienced anything similar?
p16
aVThere's a lot of pod style kits out there. I've heard good stuff about the Suorin Air, that should have refillable pods so you choose the nic strength.
p17
aVGet him a sourin air they are pretty cheap and easy to carry 
p18
aVFor me, it helped out a lot more than a traditional ecig as far as quitting cigarettes. I was running a TFV12 Battlestar combo before and the vape was fantastic. Excellent flavor and vapor production; however, I felt I\u2019d have to sit and chain vape for far too long to get a buzz. With the Suorin tho, I can get a solid buzz from 1 or 2 puffs. It really just depends what you\u2019re looking for in your vape.\u000a\u000aTLDR: better for the buzz
p19
aVWhat's the lowest nicotine level you've been able to go while still getting a "buzz"?\u000a\u000aI use 50 mg/ml nicotine for my suorin air, but I've been thinking it is probably best if I lessen the level of nicotine I use. \u000a\u000aI need to buy a new suorin air and haven't had any nicotine in a few days. Does anyone recommend a good level? I was thinking 30 but I'll be upset if I spend $20 and not feel anything. The buzz is the reason I use it.
p20
aVI've went through quite a few mtl devices like the breeze.\u000a\u000a\u000a-Limitless pulse is a great pod pen that is basically a long juul that is refillable.\u000a\u000a-Icare2 is a pretty good mtl that is a great upgrade to the 1 despite having iffy coils\u000a\u000a-Vaporesso Aurora is a nifty zippo like mtl that looks like a slightly bigger zippo lighter\u000a\u000a-Phix is kinda garbage and tried to live off the juul hype but due to overpriced pods and difficult refilling the prejuiced pods I can't recommend it\u000a\u000a-Suorin Air is my current mtl nic salt mod and I really like it. Basically a thicker credit card with auto pull but I have heard mixed reviews about the coils.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAll of these I can add more to but I'm on mobile and didn't want to type forever for no reason.
p21
aVCan you lung hit a suorin air?\u000a\u000aI\u2019m worried about burning coils. Can you do lung hits on a suorin air without burning the coils?
p22
aVIf I was to recommend anything to a starter you could either go the route of a All in one system (means the battery, tank, and mod is all one unit) such as a Aspire Breeze, juul, or suorin air. Buttttttt I would strongly suggest getting a Smoant Charon and a Crown III tank. You will need to buy batteries and a battery charger tho (which may not be the route you wish to take at this early of a stage)\u000a\u000aI would suggest going to YouTube and searching \u201cAIO vape mod\u201d and starting from there. YouTube is your best friend in this situation.\u000a\u000aElement vape \u000aVaporDNA \u000aThose are two very good sites\u000a
p23
aVNp. Head over to the sidebar of r/electronic_cigarette for more useful links. Most beginners are recommended with vape pens (all in ones) or pods (juul, suorin, etc) for starters. Try to avoid Smok products. Though some may have good experiences with them, a lot of threads with issues have been and still being posted. With their mass production comes with poor/unreliable quality. GL!

aVDropped my Suorin Air in a cup of water...\u000a\u000aI was drunk at a party so I made the mistake of blowing on it and trying to hit it again. It was firing by itself when I turned it on. I really messed this one up lol.\u000a\u000aI'm assuming its a lost cause, but I have had it in rice for about 12 hours since then. Anybody have experience with this? 
p26
aVThe coil/cotton only lasts 5 or so fills before needing replacement. I use the Suorin Air, ICare Mini, Aspire Breeze and others and they all need new coils after about a week. Time is a bad measure because it\u2019s different for everyone and it\u2019s actual puffs that matter. The cotton in most coils will last about 2000 hits or so, give or take. When I was chain vaping, I was lucky to get three days off a coil. Now that I\u2019m not chain vaping, I get 6 or 7 days.
p27
aVBut is it just as efficient/natural if I were to just use a pod system? lol I wouldn't mind picking up a suorin air or icare for salt nic, but definitely would like to pick up a Nautilus 2 over a pod if a low watt, mtl tank can work just as well \U0001f914

aVSuorin Air leaking?\u000a\u000aWondering if this is a common problem among users. My suorin air has been leaking from the bottom for a few weeks now, even after I replaced an old cartridge. \u000a\u000aI'm more worried about the longevity of my device, rather than the fact that I'm losing a bit of juice each time I leaks. It never forms a puddle or anything, but it leaks out in "droplets" of juice. I'm currently using Mr. Salt-E if that is relevant. \u000a\u000aI hope I'm not the only one with this problem. Thanks!
p29
aVI reccomend the suorin air if you want a cheaper option. Pods are 7 bucks and juice is anywhere from 10 to 30. Great for nicotine fix, not so much clouds. Holds a really long charge after you charge it for about 30 min.
p30
aVSuorin Air is the name of it!

aVYeah, suorin wont bring you as much clouds as you want. Its really good for getting your nicotine fix, though! Love it for that and its portability

aVSourin Air Tasting Burnt For No Apparent Reason\u000a\u000aJust got my new Sourin Air in the mail today, using Mr Salt-E juice (45 mg).  I also bought 3 spare pods.  I filled each of them up, let them prime for 1 hour each.  At first everything was OK; flavor was meh, but for $25 it aint bad.  However, after about 20 minutes of medium usage they already started tasting incredibly burnt.  This was happening on ALL the pods.  I let them sit again for another hour, and the same thing happened.  They taste fine at first, then start to taste burnt.  I looked at the cotton/wick (not sure which it uses) through the translucent pod, and they're white as can be.  This is incredibly frustrating, because I have no clue what is going on.  Anybody have any insight, or a solution for this issue?

aVYes, I know the Suorin Air is Mouth to Lung and I\u2019m pretty sure the Aspire Breeze is a similar device, although I don\u2019t know much about it. \u000a\u000aI would assume both of them use Mic Salts instead of conventional e-liquid. All that means is it\u2019s got more nicotine and simulates a real cigarette better without sacrificing flavor.

p53
aVNot everybody likes vaping at 15watts. I know I didn't when I first started vaping. I eventually went back to cigarettes. Only once I could vape at 80w+ was I satisfied with vaping. Vaping at higher wattage means more power is required, which means larger batteries, sometimes two or three of them.\u000a\u000a I would say most people on Reddit that vape have a device capable of 75w or more and maybe that's why you don't think that vaping has gone in the direction you prefer. But you're just plain wrong. \u000a\u000aNic salts are fairly new to the mainstream and allow those low watt devices to push a lot of nicotine at low power. Juul, sourin air, mi-one, sourin drop all take nic salts. And even if nicotine isn't your thing and that doesn't matter there are plenty of stealth mods that you could fit in the palm of your hand that aren't designed for nic salt.\u000a\u000aSo the reason you're getting downvoted is because you didn't bother to do any type of research before complaining.

aVI would get a refillable pod system such as the Aspire Breeze, the Suorin Drop, or my personal fave the Limitless Pulse they are quite simple to fill and pretty discrete.

When I pulled it out, nothing seemed out of place and the cartridge was in tight. No smell on it all? How could of this happened? Any way to prevent it? I don't want to smell like ice cream and berries at work everyday.
p65
aVI do not have a Suorin but I have heard of people having leak issues and just issues in general if they use the V1 pods for the V2 or vice versa because they were not meant to be used for each other and people weren\u2019t sure how to tell if it was a V1 or V2 pod. \u000a\u000aI\u2019m not sure how to identify the difference between the V1 or V2 pods but I remember seeing a post a couple days ago where somebody explained how to tell the difference so if you maybe look around you may find the post?

aVWeird that they would make it 50/50 when you're "supposed" to use 70/30... I say "supposed" because that's what was explained to me and it's in the suorin/icare manual. 
p76
aVI had one and threw it out because it always bubbled and had spit back. Soon as I\u2019d clear it, within an hour it was spitting and getting nic salt in my mouth. For this type of setup, I like the Suorin Air or the ICare Mini with the added portable charging cradle. No spitback or bubbling with the Suorin and only a little right after filling the iCare mini. That charging cradle is great for many fills of the small tank and you can use it without the cradle if you need super stealth. 
p77
aVYeah because suorin has fixed wattage at 15w
p78

p80
aVWith the nicotine salts it\u2019s super smooth. I recommend either mr salte juice or solace juice in a suorin air. Both of those come in 35mg. It\u2019s the closest you will get to a cig.

aVNew sourin pods burning quickly?\u000a\u000aI bought the Sourin Air a few months ago and my pods would last me 2-3 weeks without it tasting the slightest bit burnt. Me and a friend recently stacked up on some new V2 coils, the ones with the shorter cotton, and it only took a few days to start tasting burnt. Is there any reason behind this? Are they poorly made now so you buy them more often? Is it bad to use a V2 pod on a V1? I mean they look identical. Was just wondering if anyone had this problem also.
p83
aVI agree. I have the Juul and the Suorin Air and that's what did it for me. They both use nic salts which much more resemble the hit off a cigarette and allow higher nic without being too harsh.\u000a\u000aStill use my regular mod but any time I get a BAD craving, I take a few rips off my juul or air and I'm good to go.

aVWill I build an addiction if I strictly vape 3 nic\u000a\u000aHello r/Vaping. I am thinking about joining the mod community after previously owning a suorin. I have decided to switch from a suorin to a mod because I feel that I am starting to develop more intense cravings, but not yet an addiction, to nikki. Now my question is this: If I only use nic free or occasionally 3mg will I build a strong craving to nic? Anecdotes are welcomed, thanks
p89
aVYeah. You're consuming a regular dosage of an addictive substance. At least that's how I see it would likely work. \u000a\u000aAs always things with people and addictions sometimes are subjective to them personally and one may not feel as dependent as the other. One person may start to feel cravings and the dependency more than others in a given time frame or maybe in general. I'm not a doctor just speculating on what I've observed in myself and others. \u000a\u000aIt sounds like you're already feeling somewhat addicted with cravings, do you also get irritable when you have gone a given time without? The Sourin probably had a high nic level and depending on frequency of use you may be feeling it already. \u000a\u000aJust taper down to 0mg or cold turkey it and stick it out for a bit with 0mg if you want for health concerns or whatever reasons it may worry you. I mean it isn't the healthiest thing in the world to be on it anyways I suppose. \u000a\u000aI went from cigarettes to 3mg after 9 years of smoking at various frequencies (not quite a pack a day and lesser as I got older, sometimes not many at all a day, sometimes up to a pack if drinking) and haven't thought about cutting it out quite yet, but I've beat worse things in the past so I know I could endure it. \u000a\u000aEither way you likely will be somewhat dependent on it and since you're still young (not an insulting way), maybe tapering off and nipping it in the bud is better. Then again you're old enough to decide how you want to live. Either way hopefully you figure out what you want to do and maybe this was of some help.

aVOpen system?\u000a\u000aHey guys. So I'm a member of this consumer reporting company where I get cash from time to time for doing surveys or trying out products. They called me about a new one yesterday asking if I've ever tried an open system vape before? I've never even heard of this so I did some googling and I guess it's a new term the FDA is trying to implement and some vapes like a certain blu e cig have an open system. I have a sourin air, icare mini, and rx mini with a couple different tanks but I'm pretty sure both nic salt devices are kind of close to this open system. Anybody know of any cheap "open system" products I can buy at a smoke shop before next week to make sure I qualify for this survey?
p91
aVThat's what I figured, but in the blue ecig website it showed a diagram with like a 3 piece vape. Battery, atomizer/juice reservoir and mouthpiece. I'm assuming the sourin is close but I wasn't sure. We don't need more fucking names for things FDA \U0001f644

aVSuorin Air V2 Pod Refill- it\u2019s a mess\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve recently purchased a suorin Air and love the device but refilling the pod for it is a mess. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just me or what but I can\u2019t seem to get the juice in to the pod without a mess and the juice doesn\u2019t go in to the pod and instead just kind of collects and pools in the opening and doesn\u2019t enter the pod, spilling all over the sides. Is there a better way to refill the pod or is it just always going to be a mess every time I need to refill it?

aVthey aren\u2019t lying. i watch them do it. i go in with my best friend to buy 50mg nic salt juice with him. i know for a fact that they chain vape 45-50 all day for a month or two and they can quit anytime they want because i\u2019ve seen friends of mine quit. they use juuls, juno\u2019s, suorin airs and aspire breezes if you\u2019d like to look up the device they use.

aVDoes the icare 2 work well with nic salts?\u000a\u000aI have the juul and the mi one currently, I love the juul but pods are expensive as hell for 3ml and the mi one could crap out kinda quickly. That being said does anyone have experience using like 45-50nic with the icare 2? I'd get a suorin air but my shop doesn't sell them and I wanna try the icare. 
p96
aVWuddup. I think I might be allergic to the vape juice?\u000a\u000aI'm in college and I just bought the Suorin air like 2 weeks ago and I've been experiencing a sore throat idk if this is common when you first start vaping. I read online that 1/10 people are allergic to the PG in the juice. I just wanted to know if anyone else has had this problem. I've been hitting it pretty hard already on my third refill maybe I'm just not used to it. Any feedback is helpful. Thanks.
p97
aVYou may not be truly allergic, but PG sensitivity is somewhat common. It also may be a flavor that you're using (for instance, some people are allergic to banana).\u000a\u000aAs someone else said, stay hydrated for sure. Unfortunately, with a system like the Suorin Air, you can't really up the VG or it won't wick properly. You could look into a sub-ohm setup that will let you use higher VG liquids, but that's up to you.\u000a\u000aWere you a smoker who switched, or did you just pick up vaping? For people who switch, there's a lot of unpleasant symptoms for the first month or so while your body flushes out the toxins from smoking. I had throat sores for about a month, just had to power through it. If you picked up vaping on its own, then your body may be acclimating to the new "thing."
p98
aVyes juul's are nic salt, suorin air is a very simple system as well you just turn it on and take a pull to hit the vape.

p103
aVI use 30 in my suorin. I use this when I\u2019m out and not hitting it nearly as much. 30 is my sweet spot. I tried a friends 50 and damn that shit hit way harder than a juul. So def under 45 for myself 
p104
aVup to you man, I enjoy the suorin and 30. 40 might be okay but you probably won\u2019t be hitting as much
p105
aVTry the Suorin Air. It pulls almost exactly like a cigarette, the only problem it looks nothing like a vape or cigarette. I gave one to my mom and it helped her cut back on smoking a lot. Now she'll smoke like 1 or 2 cigarettes a month (usually when she's out of juice)
p106
aVBest vape for salt nic\u000a\u000aHi, I bought my mom a suorin air  so she would quit smoking. It worked!! She hasn't smoked in about 30 days, but her vape gave out. The battery works for about 3 hits and then dies. So then I got her another one and she had ran into the same problem. She is using the correct charger and all but I was just wondering if there was anything more stout or should I just get her a regular mod and juice. Thank you in advance. 
p107
aVNah I ended up selling it it was just too much maintenance for me you know? I prefer just a simple juul or suorin where you don't have to replace coils, prime it etc.
p108
aVAre you using the "direct to lung" method to take hits or the "mouth to lung", like smoking a cig to hit your vape? I use 45mg Mr. Salt-E or 50mg Solace juices in a Suorin Air and the MTL method and I sometimes get light headed if I hit it too often and one time I got a few drops in my mouth and started feeling nauseous. Burning at 20w should be fine since most MTL devices burn about that as well, if you\u2019re not getting sick from too much nic then you should be fine if you\u2019re not chain vaping. Nic salts absorbs better than regular nic found in most juices. Which is why I use it for work where I can only take a 5 min break every hour or so. When home, I burn regular nic in my g-priv or t-priv but also using MTL tanks and I hit those with a restricted direct lung method and chain vape because of the lower nic content. 
p109
aVHow you like that Suorin Air? My wife's just shipped yesterday, but I'm kind of hoping she doesn't like it so I can steal it, even though it's pink(ish) lol

aVSuorin Questions Please help!!!!!!!!!!!!\u000a\u000a[removed]
p114
aVI just bought my first salt nic from level up vapor, mango flavor. It's pretty good, I'm not crazy about mango flavors but another poster sold me on it. I figured there was no sense in buying another mod for salt nic, especially something that uses cartridges. I like building and feel cartridges/subohms are for those who either can't build or can't be bothered with it. But I'll be honest, I still really want a suorin air or an iCare 2 for the form factor.
p115
aVIn a nutshell it uses crystallized nicotine instead of liquid nic. This allows for a smoother hit with a higher nic level. Generally the devices you use salt nic with are high ohm, low wattage and low air flow. However I build my Merlin mini with a 1.3ohm coil and I'm waiting for some salt nic from level up vapor. So we will see what happens. iCare and suorin are a couple mod makers for this. I tried it at a vape convention and it's pretty sweet. Not really for cloud chasing though. But, you get a nice lung hit and that nicotine high some people like. 24mg feels like 6-10 or so and 45mg-50mg feels like 24mg from what I've heard.
p116
aVsuorin air caused me oversalivation\u000a\u000ai used the suorin air for about two-three weeks. i filled it with 12 mg mango juice from the naked brand. then another juice with 30 mg. everytime i would hit it, i would get a buzz beyond this world, but i would oversalivate. now this has become a lasting issue. i havent smoked vaped in two days and i'm drooling like a dog. wtf is going on?
p117
aVIf you want something with a tighter draw like a cigarette there are plenty of ultra portable kits out there like the Juul. All of my friends got Juuls but they're replacement pods are in high demand where I live so we moved over to the Suorin Air and I've been loving it! Easy to fill with just and extremely small
p118
aVI\u2019ve been using the Suorin Air and the MTL is great out of the box, no adjustments can be made.  I also use the iCare mini which is too loose for MTL but great for restricted. Both are great for stealth vaping at work.
p119
aVYou will want/need higher nic content if you\u2019ve been using a sub-ohm with 3mg, nic. The equivalent to 3mg nic would be 12 mg nic in your same everyday juice or 30 to 45mg nic salts, which absorbs much better and gives a very satisfying vape with the small amount of vapor you\u2019ll be producing. I\u2019ve been loving my Suorin Air and icare mini with nic salts from Mr Salt-E, I can take a 5 minute vape break at work and get the same satisfaction I use to get from a cig break and be good for an hour or two till the next break. It\u2019s also good for those high stress moments when you think you might really want a cig instead of vape.

If you get the saltnic brand for the suorin, make sure to stick with the 25mg, the 50 was too harsh.\u000a\u000aHow is the Icare 2 compared to the original icare? My local vape shop still hasn't gotten it. I also tried the aspire breeze but it had too much airflow.

aVHave you had any issues with the suorin?
p124
aVAll these devices have some sort of issue. With the Suorin I felt that it was the most consistent device next to the Juul. I've been vaping subohm tanks and mods for close to 4 years now and lately I've been leaving my Mod at home when I go out. I'm confident that a full charge and a full tank in the suorin will last me the evening when going out.

aVI was a 3 pack a day smoker just over 4 months ago (smoked for 44 years) and I weened myself off the cigs by having one per hour and one after a meal for the first 2 weeks, vaping 12mg in between. By then end of the first week I noticed I was skipping my hourly smoke and going 2 and 3 hours without one. By the end of the second week I went most of the day without one and only had one after a meal. That's when I quit them all together and haven't had one since. I am a Mouth to lung vaper and I enjoy the "act" of vaping (smoking) and don't have plans to actually quit vaping. There has been a few stressful days I wish I had a cig but luckily I also carry a small icare mini and/or a Suorin Air filled with 45mg nic salts which sounds extremely high but it absorbs differently and gives a great throat hit and really helps for those extra stressful days and during work when you can only go out occasionally to have a break. But when I'm home, it's back to chain vaping the 12mg.
p129
aVfrom Vaping.com:\u000a\u000a&gt;The difference comes from using nicotine salts. "Nic salts" more closely resemble the feel of traditional cigarettes because of its quicker absorption into your bloodstream.\u000a\u000a&gt;These products are specifically meant to be used in pod-based, closed systems and low-output atomizers/mods. We recommend these liquids for use with the Vapor Shark Minnow, Eleaf iCare, Wismec MyJet, or Suorin Air for optimum performance. 
p130
aVSuorin Air, $20, replacement tanks/coil is $4 but can be refilled many times, no buttons, just suck. Use with Mr. Salt-E 45mg nic salts, so smooth,so stealthy and I'm on my second week with same pod. Or try the Vaporesso Aurora, looks and feels like a Zippo lighter, battery lasts 2 full tanks of juice and takes 1.5 hrs to charge. The Suorin takes about half the time to charge but you will be charging it twice in one tank of juice. Or try the ICare mini and get the Personal Charging Cradle (PCC) for about $25 or $30 and use the same juice with a slightly looser draw and the cradle is small enough to pocket and will give you a full day of battery and you'll fill the tank 5 or 6 times before needing a charge with the cradle, or a half tank of  juice per charge without the cradle. I have all three and love all three for stealth vaping at work. The nic salts satisfies lomg enough between smoke breaks while working. I can carry all three at the same time.
p131
aVI was a 2 to 3 pack a day smoker for 44 years and I started with 12mg juice but I couldn't burn it in a baby beast because it was like razor blades on the throat. I got a Nautilus tank and burned at 15 to 18 watts with cigarette like draws (mouth to lung) and I've been cig free for over 4 months now. I admit I was chain vaping at that level but I was out of work so that contributed to the chain vaping. I recently got back to work and started using small low wattage devices like the Suorin Air, icare mini and Vaporesso Aurora with 45mg nic salts by Mr. Salt-E and these are fantastic for that one to two hours between smoke breaks, I'll hit these for like 5 mins and my nic level is good to go for the no vape time between breaks.

aVA warning about salt-based nicotine\u000a\u000aHello! I've recently seen a lot of hand-checks with Juuls and Suorin Airs. I work at a vape shop and have been working here for over a year now, and I've been interested in this industry for multiple years. I just thought I'd let everyone know in case some people *don't* know, the pods in the Juuls and salt-based nicotine in general could be harmful.\u000a\u000aThe nicotine in our house juice only goes up to 24mg in a 50/50 blend, but most, if not all, of these salt-based nicotines in the Juul pods are 50+ mg of nicotine. The juice we carry and the nicotine in it is as harmful to someone as caffeine is.\u000a\u000aThe only thing I'm personally really worried about is that these high milligrams of nicotine are highly addictive because you can be vaping at 58mg of nicotine and not feel it at all, but when you go to quit vaping or go to a lower nicotine, which is essentially the end plan for most people (get off of some sort of addiction). But if you are using these Juuls and high salt-based nicotine, you may end up picking up another addiction, nicotine.\u000a\u000aI've seen a lot of people come in this store and I've also seen multiple articles online that the high nicotine feels great because you can't even tell that you're on that high of a nicotine, but at the same time, once you go to put it down, you don't want to.\u000a\u000aI'm just as worried for people using these as I am for the industry as a whole. If this type of nicotine and getting addicted, this could potentially make a very bad name for the vaping community. It's something for the media to pick up. Similar situation for mods "blowing up". If people read into it and realized mods don't just spontaneously blow up and it's more of a *user* error, the name for vaping wouldn't be nearly as bad. But what can you do, the media is media and will always throw information out there, out-of-proportion.\u000a\u000aIn addition, the Juul pods are roughly $16 for 4 or 5, which can certainly rack up in price, quickly.\u000a\u000aI am definitely not here to tell you all what to do and what not to do, but I just felt like putting my opinion out there on these salt-based nicotines. They seem to be creating stronger addictions, and I've noticed myself that a lot of the younger generation have been picking these up, some of whom have never smoked at all. Therefore, they are creating addictions instead of getting rid of some.\u000a\u000aEdit:\u000a**TL;DR: This is just a personal opinion and observation. Keep an open mind and be knowledgeable about what you're putting into your system! Salt-based nicotine could be dangerous, and I would personally keep away from it.**
p133
aVNic salts is different than nic in diy juice and everyday premium vape juice, it absorbs quicker and is intended for MTL vapers, not your normal DL sub-ohm tanks. It gives the small amount of vapor a more equal nicotine hit comparable to a cigarette. It is not intended for chain vaping, unless you are a chain smoker to begin with. Many people, like myself, aren't necessarily trying to quit the "act of smoking". I just wanted to save money and get rid of the stink. I use the Suorin Air and Icare mini with Mr. Salt-E 45mg nic salt. These are low wattage devices similar to the JUUL. They are Mouth to lung devices that only produce the amount of vapor a cigarette would, roughly. I use these primarily for work where I can't chain vape my everyday mod. They are great for that 5 min cig break during the day because they give me the nicotine effects of a cig, and I can wait an hour or two till the next break. At home, I use a mod with a restricted lung hit or MTL RTA burning around 25watts and I use the everyday nicotine that you all use, but that juice is only 12mg. That nicotine doesn't absorb as well as the nic salts and is very harsh at higher wattages, which is one reason DL vapers who use tanks like the tfv12 or Crown III only use 3mg nic, these people get their nic hit in the giant amount of clouds they suck in. If I tried using Mr Salt-E in a tfv12 and took that much cloud in, I'd probably pass out and get nic poisoning. It is your responsibility as a vape store associate to educate your customers. These devices are ment for MTL vaping for those who don't want to give up the "act of smoking", yet want to quit the stink. They are for people who have smoked 44 years at 2 to 3 packs a day and may want to ween them selves off nicotine but starting with a JUUL or Suorin for better success, keeping the "habit" as normal as possible. I've been cig free for 4 months after 44 years of stinkies. I love the act, I hate the stink. My 45mg nic gives me the same satisfaction as a cig did with the same amount of vapor as a cig. When I want more clouds, I reduce the nic. What I do see and don't like is high school kids buying JUUL to get that 5 min head rush from the high nic content. This will lead to the 44 year habit I've had. There are better things to get high on but obviously you can't tell them that.  So find out what your customers are trying to achieve. A long time smoker trying to quit will have better luck with higher nic content. If they want the cig experience then suggest a mtl tank with regular juice and 12mg nic. If they want to quit and also want DL type clouds, recommend 3 to 6mg nic. If they need the occasional cig break satisfaction then the Suorin Air, Icare / icare Mini or Vaporesso Aurora are great with nic salts.
p134
aVI have been using the Sourin Air for while now  and i have been using 50mg salt based juice and idk if i am starting to become addicted to nicotine but i found myself using it more often and using up more juice idk if i should stop with the higher salt based nicotine juice's like 50 or if i will be some what okay if i keep using it.
p135
aVAll in ones\u000a\u000aI currently you have the juul and the mi one but I was wondering between the mi one, icare, and suorin air which is the best MLT vape for salt nic (35-45). I tried my friend's suorin air last night and it's super smooth, the mi isn't bad either but does anyone know how the icare might compare?
p136
aVI have the Icare mini and to me, the MTL draw is too loose. I use it for a restricted direct lung hit more often than not. The Suorin Air has a great MTL draw and I burn 45mg Mr. Salt-E and it's very smooth with a great lung hit. Another great MTL aio is the Vaporesso Aurora and it has long lasting coils and larger battery, 650mAh compared to the Suorins 350ish mAh. I go through two tanks of juice per battery charge in the Aurora. The Suorin needs to be charged 4 times per tank of fluid but is much more comfortable to use than the Aurora but the coil doesn't last nearly as long. I'm on my second coil pod in a week on the Suorin and I'm on my 3rd coil in 4 months on the Aurora. I use these mostly for work where I only vape for 5 or 10 mins every hour or two and the nic salts covers me in between. My all day vapes are restricted lung hit rta's @ 22 watts and 12mg normal nic (for lack of a better term) and I chain vape these. 
p137
aVDang, thank ya kindly! Although, how does the icare battery compare them to the suorin?
p138
aVThe Icare mini battery by it self will last roughly a half to 3/4 tank of juice but with the personal charging cradle (pcc) it will last all day and 4 or 5 tank fills. The beauty of it is that it's small enough to keep in pocket or just keep the Icare in your pocket and place the pcc on your desk and put the mini in the cradle between breaks. If you place it in the cradle the wrong way, it won't charge and it will float in the cradle due to the magnets. I think by itself the battery is 360mAh and the cradle adds another 2300mah. The tank is small and DO NOT fill over the fill line because it will overflow and you'll have a mess. By it self it will last about as long as the Suorin, but again, the Suorin has a slightly larger tank but you have to always have a charging cable handy. I bring and two of the three to work and the Suorin is dead by noon and the mini or the Aurora will still be going on my drive home.

aVI have the iCare mini and just got the Suorin Air with Mr Salt-E Strawberry Funnel cake. The Suorin is a great MTL draw, about as good or even a little better than the Vaporesso Aurora, but it could stand to have a better battery. I love these little devices for work, the two will last me all day if I take a break every hour for 5 to 7 mins, about the average cig break and can even sneak a few hits in the bathroom for a Voop break.

aVHow long does a coil on the sourin usually last you?
p142
aVThank you for posting this. I tried the suorin air at ECC Ontario(L.A.) and finally got to see what all the hype was with salt nic. I've also been trying to figure out what that mod was called for the past 2 weeks. I will say that salt nics are incredibly satisfying. I took like 3 or 4 drags and was very surprised on how great I felt. So perfect for discreet vaping and a quick break. My problem is that I like vaping, but over the last 4 or more years something has begun to go missing. Definitely going to buy one\u000a\u000aAlso, can anyone recommend some good salt nic juice? Thanks.
p143
aVIt's a higher concentration of a different kind of nicotine that absorbs better and gives a more satisfying throat hit and longer lasting effect but because of this, it's not for direct lung high wattage tanks. The small amount of vapor equal to cigs is all you need and lower wattage mouth to lung devices like the Suorin Air, My Jet, ICare Series are perfect for this. Mr Salt-E is a good juice and comes in 30 and 45mg nic strength and 6 to 8 hits and you're good to go till your next cig break. Not intended for chain vaping but rather cig breaks like you'd take at work. I love my Suorin and icare mini, the Suorin has a better MTL draw than the mini but I like a tight restricted direct lung hit from the mini too. Nic salts is much smoother than say 18mg of normal nic juice.

aVNic salt is made for those little aio pod type vape. I'm using 45mg Mr. Salt-E Strawberry Funnel cake in an ICare mini and a Suorin Air. It absorbs more/faster than regular nic so you only want 5 to 10 hits to get the equivalent nic of a cig, leaving you more satisfied and not meant for chain vaping. I use it for work where I can't chain vape, I take it outside for about 5 mins every hour and I'm good to go till the next hour or so. I use MTL tanks on my adv but only use 12 mg nic and need to constantly vape that with little break I between. Nic salt is no where near as harsh as say an 18 or 24mg of regular nic which to me is like swallowing razor blades, hence the 12mg regular nic.  NS gives a nice throat hit with little cig-like puffs and is why the JUUL is so popular.

aVSourin air replacement pods different quality\u000a\u000aHey guys, I know this isn't a normal build/mod question but if anyone has any input I could use it. Bought myself a sourin air the other day as a replacement to my icare but I noticed something annoying. The pod the stock unit comes with has an almost matte sticker on the bottom with the sourin logo, slides in real easy and has a tight draw. I bought a replacement pod and these seem to have a shiny, bulkier sticker that makes it hard to fit in the battery and the draw is way more loose. Is this common?

aVi was a 9 years cancer stick sucker. decided to vape when cigarettes makes my heartbeat faster and chest feeling tight (during riding a bike, mostly), plus throat ache. i also downgraded from marlboro red, to less tar/nicotine cigs because of the harsher throat hit over the years. \u000a\u000aso i just celebrated my birthday 6 months ago, and i think i deserve to treat myself a birthday gift. a vape kit. coincidentally, i run out of cigarettes since morning when i bought my first vape kit on afternoon. it was a wismec rx mini kit, with root beer malaysian liquid. a low wattage mod, no nicotine / throat hit, but i like the flavor and more cloud than cigarettes. i like it so far. then i only smoke when the battery is charging. \u000a\u000awhen it broke after two weeks (damn you wismec) i'm back to smoke all day. but it already taste worse before i start vaping. so i decided to buy smoant battlestar with a limitless rdta atomizer borrowed from a friend. better flavor, better cloud. i was happy. much happier. turns out i like chucking huge dense cloud. that was amazing.\u000a\u000aand now vaping is my hobby. new mods, new atomizers, watching youtuber reviews, trying out coil builds, trying new juices, etc. now i can sleep better, wake up fresher, no more fast heartbeat, no more cancer sticks.\u000a\u000athe point is, you must quit smoking for your health. i admit, for the first 2 months i still LOVE the smell of tobacco when someone is smoking around me. but after that i just don't like it anymore. it's like smelling a pesticide and i don't want to smell it. last month i tried my friend's cigarette once. it's a marlboro menthol. it tastes so bitter, and i find it that vape has better throat/nicotine hit than that. i quit the cigarette halfway through. thank god.\u000a\u000ato OP: i'd suggest a mini/closed system mod. the way it feels much like a cigarette. then find a liquid with salt nicotine designed for closed system mod. i never try any mini mods before except suorin air with a salt nicotine liquid and i think that's pretty close to a cigarette.\u000a\u000aother suggestion is, buy a medium price range dual battery mod, a subohm tank if you don't want to bother installing coils and wicking, and a 9 or 12 mg nicotine liquid.  for me (and most of my friends) 6 mg nic USA liquids like Charlie Noble is way too strong, but to each and their own.
p159
aVYeah this is the first mod i've ever built in. and i bought the S/O the best starter kit my local store recommended. I previously used Pod systems such as the Juul and the Sourin Air but im having alot of fun with low-nic and good flavour juices in this first mod. \u000a\u000aSmall question, in the Serpent SMM are the included coils supposed to be such low ohms like .14?\u000a\u000aand Cheers.

aV\u000aSuorin Air is the typical design of most devices in vaping technology, the Suorin Air requires a double take at first glance.

aVI don\u2019t have that system, but how much juice did you run through it? \u000a\u000aI\u2019ve had an infinix in the past and pods burnt out after 8ml, but my suorin are makes it through about 20 before burning out 
p167
aVThey are, the suorin vagon
p168
aVThat doesn't seem like it should be too much, maybe try some 3mg in the suorin?
p169
aVMaybe a suorin air, but I find that even that hits harder than my buddy\u2019s juul. Hell every refillable system I\u2019ve used hits harder than a juul. You get used to the added throat it

aVIf you want a new pod system with less wattage, get a suorin air, or drop. The Mi-Pod is a pricier option but they got a lot of colors and a crazy good warranty if it breaks.

aVBest mods for salt nic?\u000a\u000aHave tried: Juul, Suorin Air &amp; Drop, Aspire Breeze and MiPod. \u000a\u000aI have been off the death sticks for a little under a year now. Juul was my gateway into the vape world, but quickly wanted more choices in flavor, reusability and airflow. Suorin products were a great first alternative, although not worth the dry hits / breathing in melting plastic. The MiPod is my go to right now, although hard to find places that sell carts. But all fail to give that same \u201cthroat hit\u201d like Juul. \u2014 which was a big contributor to reducing smoking cravings. Any suggestions for better mods than the following or juices that are similar to Juul\u2019s Virginia Tobacco? \u000a\u000aMuch appreciated!
p176
aVHad a bad experience with Smok products in the past, but after a closer look at the Nord today, it seems very similar in design to MiPod cart/coil system (which I liked better than Suorin), so may give it a try in the future.

aVVape Juice and Kit Inquiry\u000a\u000aI am relatively new to vaping. Started with a Juul, replaced exchanged that with a Suorin Drop (terrible product), then I ultimately  transitioned to a Smok OSUB 80W baby kit. Now that I\u2019m fully accustomed to an 80W vaporizer, I want to buy a 225W starter kit. Should I purchase the 225W kit, and what wattage do most people use with such a box mod? \u000a\u000aAs for my other question, when I purchase vape juice, they ask what strength I desire, and I give them a number (1-10, they probably go higher, I assume). So, I select the juice, tell them the potency (8), then they mix the juice with pure nicotine (it\u2019s in a large tank)  to match my request. So, would an 8 entail 8mg/60mL, or an 8% concentration of nicotine? I know most Juuls pods have a 5% concentration. Also, since the juice already contains nicotine (one I purchased the other day contains 3mg/60mL, would they just add an additional 5mg of nicotine to accomplish an 8% concentration? Thanks.

aVsuorin drop hitting weird\u000a\u000ahi guys, so I just bought a suorin drop today and filled it with blaze e-liquid. at first it hit fine but now it seems to hit super harsh at my throat and tastes very strong, like the juice is ending up in my mouth. when I take the mouthpiece off, the cartridge is not leaking or anything though. anyone have similar experiences or a solution? any help would be appreciated -- thank you!

aVI'm currently using a Suorin Drop with nic salts. Would you say this device is better even if I never get to mess with escribe?
p185
aVThat's kinda relieving honestly. I'm not super knowledgeable about vaping, I use a Suorin Drop now. I definitely want an upgrade but I'm glad that I won't need an electrical engineering degree with this lol.
p186
aVI have sooooo much to learn. I started on the Juul but couldn't afford pods that were almost as expensive as cigarettes. My first "real vape" is this Suorin Drop, but this thing is so hit or miss when I put in a new pod. Sometimes it'll work, sometimes it won't. Sometimes the pods go in regular, sometimes they only work backwards. So annoying!
p187
aVHm, weird. The drop is normally a solid device. Sourin makes great stuff
p188
aVI've only ever used a Juul, Suorin Drop, and a Smoant S8 so I don't even know what I'm missing from a subohm lol. The idea of being able to control the airflow with the Orion Go is kinda blowing my mind lol.

I checked for cracks and even painted a layer of clear nail polish over the sides in case there was a crack that I couldn\u2019t see, but the sides are still leaking. The bottom of the cart, where the metal contacts are- is dry. But sometimes the sides will leak down into the suorin itself. Has anyone else had this problem? I did a quick google search and it seems as if this is a new issue.

aVPretty much any half decent refillable pod system with 50mg nic salts. I\u2019ve been using a suorin air for over 6 months, and it hits harder than a juul. Picked it up for less than 20 bucks too.

aVI had a Suorin Air before it mysteriously vanished one day. I've been putting off getting another one hoping another pod mod would sway me but I'm pretty close to just getting another one. Much closer to a cigarette and I almost stopped using my box mod completely while I had it.

aVYeah they\u2019re all really good in my opinion. The Smok Novo is probably the best of the bunch, the one I use is the suorin air and it\u2019s almost perfect.

aVHaving sold over 100 Suorin Air at my shop and removing the Drop from my shelves.  I feel confident you will be happier with the Air.  The Vladdin is nice, but the airflow is more restricted.  
p201
aVLate af but oh well. I don\u2019t know what a Vladdin is, might check it out, but I DO own 2 suorin drops and an air, and I honestly prefer the air. Drops are great, and are much more durable than the air, but I feel like the drop pops and leaks more. Also has shit hits if I haven\u2019t ripped for a couple hours. The air pm never has issues (atleast for me), and always seems to have a reliable hit. It feels smoother than a drop. Plus it\u2019s a lil cheaper. Pods are the same price. I\u2019d honestly just buy both, their great devices. Also nice to have a lil rotation going. I use a juul, air, drop, vagon, badge, breeze 2, and the Eon device. I use a different device daily.
p202
aVI can\u2019t take the batteries out, it\u2019s like a sourin drop. Do I just separate the pod from the body?

aVLooking for new refillable pod system. Also some tips on what to build/what wattage for nic salt until I get one\u000a\u000aHey all. Nic salts got me back into vaping after a long hiatus back to cigs. I had a juul, then a suorin vagon. Juul was too expensive per week and the vagon crapped out on me. Any advice on a good pod mod for salts? \u000a\u000aIt's gonna be a few weeks before I can afford a new mod with Xmas coming up and all so I'm trying to build on my old dna75 until I can get a new one.

aVSuorin drop water damage fix\u000a\u000aI couldn\u2019t really find any threads on this (only for the Air, with the pop our method which does not work for the drop) this morning when I dropped my Drop into hot tub so I thought I\u2019d share how I fixed mine. It was completely submerged, doing that light dance and still sort of hitting but not really.\u000a\u000aI removed the cartridge which was totally shot (didn\u2019t really get why? It was more fucked than the machine. Whatever.) took a Q-tip to the areas that I could reach, and then filled up the area the cartridge would normally go with a tissue  and left it upside down for about 25 minutes then affixed it with tape to the vent of my air conditioner in my car and left it that way for about an hour with the fan on full blast with the actual cooling function off. New pod in and it works perfectly! I did hop into action trying to fix it immediately after so that\u2019s worth noting. Hope this helps someone!
p209
aVNice - I'm trying to make this decision too - how long do the Orion pods last for you? I'm currently using a suorin air 2 and do about 2ml/day- pod lasts anywhere between 1.5-4 days.

aVThere are several to choose from.\u000a\u000aAspire Breeze\u000aSuorin Drop\u000a\u000aThose are just a few......\u000a\u000aAnd although I wouldn\u2019t consider it a pod, the Orion Vape is really popular for mouth to lung.  Just make sure you check out reviews and weight out the pros and cons of each.\u000a\u000aAlso a note:  This is different for everyone, but I\u2019d stay away from nic salt devices.  Salts can be very harsh due to the amount of nicotine and potentially turn someone new to vaping off of the idea.  Whichever device you choose, id make sure it takes regular e-juice so you can have more nicotine level choices.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

aVI had a sourin drop for a little bit before giving it to a friend, I liked it. It doesn't hit quite as hard as a juul, but it feels nice in the hand, pods hold a ton of juice and are meant to be refilled.
p217
aVLove sourin and the novo
p218
aVDI think a lot of the problems are user error Nd I\u2019m sure there are some defective pods. As far as flavor, I get better flavor than any pod I\u2019ve owned. I\u2019ve had the kandypens Rubi, juul, infinix, nexus, breeze, mipod, Kado stealth, Suorin Drop and air and allure slik and none match it in flavor. I think shit flavor is people trying to compare it to a mesh subohm or rda rta, flavor isn\u2019t going to compare to those, but for what it is I love the flavor. They\u2019re on sale at breazy right now for 39.99, if the code is still good 36.99 with cvd10. Pods are 7.99 2/pack. I sound like I\u2019m advertising, but I\u2019m not I just love it that much, and I think that is one hell of a deal. Ok, guess I\u2019m done gushing.

aVBreeze 2, mipod, lost vape Orion (love that one), sourin air/drop.

But my in laws are the same way, so I just step outside for a bit if I need to scratch an itch. 
p220
aVI personally use the Suorin Air, its a Littleton bigger then a credit card, lots of nicotine because its a Salt E liquid and not much cloud. Cheap to for I think under $30 and $5 pods. Pods last me 2-4 weeks, juice lasts me over a month and I vape a lot. Super light, small, and easy to use. Just pull in air and it fires. Battery lasts me the whole day. Hope this help and good luck finding your next vape. 
p221
aVDo you mean thin and narrow or just thin?  Because if you want thin but wide the Suorin Air is s good choice.
p222
aVI\u2019m positive they are salts. I\u2019ve used a smok fit, a suorin air, suorin vagon, aspire breeze 2, a Novo, and a Nord plus some others I can\u2019t remember right now. \u000aFree base never bothers me. 
p223
aVI love it! I have a normal box mod and a few Suorin Airs and I like this one better than those. I'm fairly new to vaping in general. \u000a\u000aThis one's cool because although the instructions say it's best to use salts, you can use other juices too without harming the pods or device. Pods are supposed to last up to 14 days (give or take, of course). \u000a\u000aIt also has a feature called "replay". When you get the perfect rip off of it, you can program it to duplicate that awesome hit each time you draw off of it. I'd say it's pretty much what they say it is.
p224
aVNot sure if this question was directed at me or not but I use a Sourin Drop
p225
aVA friend has the Boulder Rock Pod system and he likes it. I\u2019m a fan of the suorin air though.
p226
aVYou probably want a pod system as they are more similar to a cigarette and will help him get the throat hit and nicotine he wants. The suorin drop and air are very good. I\u2019ve also heard good things about the Aspire Nautilus AIO kit. Avoid SMOK like the plague, as they\u2019re lower quality. Get him 40 mg salt nicotine juice. 
p227
aVHow are the suorin drop or air maintained? Is it just a matter of buying any salt nicotine juice and pouring it in or do they need proprietary nicotine cartridges to fill?
p228
aVWell it's better than a Suorin

aVHow's the suorin air treating you, got one coming in soon.

aVSuorin is poop. Crappy flavor, equally crappy reliability.\u000a\u000aJuul isn't bad for what it is, I'd get sylo or equivalent refillable pods for it instead. The Juul flavors are, by and large, shit.\u000a\u000aSmok Novo is good but questionable reliability long term, Innokin EQ is good, Vaporesso Renova zero is also good. All refillable.
p231
aVI got u:\u000a\u000a-	Never use salt juices in \u201cnormal\u201d setups; only in pod systems (Suorin Drop, July, etc)\u000a-	good coffee juices are hard as hell to find, I\u2019ve never actually found one myself after many many months of perusal \u000a-	when in doubt, ask /r/Electronic_Cigarette or /r/Vaping

aVSuorin Drop vs Smok Nord\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve been juuling for a few months now and I\u2019m getting tired of spending so much money on pods, plus I can\u2019t buy mango anywhere now. I have a few friends who have the suorin drop so I kind of had my heart set on getting one. My boyfriend recently got a SMOK Nord and I\u2019m really liking how it hits. Just looking for some guidance/advice on which product I should get.
p236
aVAhh okay!!  Hope no offense was taken. But you\u2019d be surprised the number of underage that try to come on here. It\u2019s a problem and the term you used is common amongst teens. \u000a\u000aHonestly as much as I hate smok I\u2019ve heard some good things on the novo. I\u2019m not a big pod system guy but my boss almost exclusively uses them. For open systems I\u2019ve heard great things about the novo and the drop (nothing yet on the nord). Also the lost vape Orion is great.\u000a\u000aPersonally I\u2019ve had the Suorin Vagon and drop and the Vagon I liked a bit more. Also you don\u2019t see them often but the ops 1 from smoke joy is excellent. \u000a\u000aIf you\u2019re looking for something better than the juul in a closed pod system I\u2019d look at the Juno. It\u2019s the only closed pod I recommend to anyone!
p237
aVIt's weird that Smok has a bad reputation in the industry when it comes to mods. But every single AIO system we have in the shop made by Smok,  is stellar. \u000a\u000aThe Novo is good, the Rolo is good. The imfinix wasn't bad either. I've enjoyed their products more than Suorin. 
p238
aVThere\u2019s A TON of good options. \u000a\u000aAspire has the breeze 2 and Nautilus AIO which are good.\u000a\u000aSuorins would be closer to the juul as they are draw activated and a disposable pod so less maintenance. I like the Vagon the most personally. \u000a\u000aAlso the lost vape Orion is incredible.
p239
aVWell the white one is my mech that I take pretty much everywhere. I use the smok stick when I\u2019m just sitting at my desk playing video games or streaming so that I don\u2019t have to drip. I use my sourin on a daily basis for the nicotine salts. I\u2019m vaping everyone has a setup that works for them and I\u2019m also running different juices at different mic levels in all of my setups

aVPutting pod juice in a refill system?\u000a\u000aMy phix recently broke and now I have a bunch of unused pods that I cant use with my suorin air. Is there anything stopping me from opening up a pod and filling my air with it? I know it's different from most ejuices but is is still doable?
p241
aVUse the 1.4 ohm standard coils.  I just got a box of 1.4 ohm ceramic coils and have gone through two coils in three days. I have primed them, let them sit, and do not hit them excessively, nor do I take long hits.  And yet both coils have developed a significant burnt taste after about a day and a half of regular use.  I have been using hometown hero salt nic (40mg/ml) juice, which worked great in my suorin drop. Unfortunately the drop itself had too many problems, prompting me to switch to the Nord... Avoid the ceramic coils!

aVIf you haven't yet, check out the Tip pods which are compatible for the Suorin Air. I've found they last at least 1-2 more refills than the OG pods, they are way less expensive for a pack of 3, and they have a aesthetically pleasing mouth piece on the pod.
p244
aVI appreciate the hookup! I don\u2019t want to be a salve to Sourin\u2019s business model. \U0001f602 I was looking up re-wicking them and stuff. 
p245
aVCan I use Salt Nic in any vape?\u000a\u000aI want to get stronger nicotine juice but I was told I\u2019d need to buy something like a juul or suorin to handle Salt Nic, but I already have a vape and I don\u2019t want to spend extra money if I don\u2019t need to. I have the Eleaf basal, I don\u2019t really know much about it so here\u2019s a link to its page so you can get whatever info you need to answer my question. Thanks\u000a\u000ahttps://www.eleafus.com/basal-kit.html
p246
aVLooks good! I have a question if you don\u2019t mind. My fiance wants a pod system for Christmas and I feel like this one is the best on the market right now. However my fiance likes simple set ups and I\u2019ve watched a couple videos about the different indicator lights and modes and stuff... would you say this device is complicated to use/maintain?  Like my fiance wants the smok pod or whatever, I don\u2019t purchase smok products personally but would probably get him the Sourin Drop as an alternative. 
p247
aVNice I\u2019m about a half hour outside of the city. Haha. Small world!  For something decent and inexpensive I\u2019d look at some of aspires stuff or Suorin. The aspire breeze 2 and Nautilus AIO are both great devices as is the Suorin Vagon. I\u2019d look into any of those. The Suorins are a little more maintenance free. \u000a\u000aIf you\u2019re not on a budget check out the Lost Vape Orion it\u2019s well worth it. \u000a\u000aA few of my coworkers have the OPs-1 and swear by it but I know pods might be a bit harder to find for that if you\u2019re buying in stores.\u000a\u000aIf you\u2019re looking for a bit more power like a true sub ohm setup the Voopoo mojo is Tiny and packs a punch. Also I\u2019ve heard good things on the Caliber and it may be a bit more simplistic. And the Uwell Nunchaku is great and very pocketable. But those 3 might be a little more than you\u2019re looking for. It\u2019s worth a look tho. 
p248
aVHey I kinda just posted the same thing on another Orion pic but real quick question (I\u2019ll give you the TLDR lol). \u000a  \u000aMy fiance wants a pod system for christmas after trying someones smok pod thing, forget the name. I feel like the orion is the best on the market but my fiance is not in to complicated devices. So trying to decide if the orion is too complex with the profile set ups and stuff and if I should just get him the sourin drop. 
p249
aVThat thing looks fricken sweet dude! I have an eleaf ipower under my drop rda and its ol' reliable. I got a suorin air to try pods and theyre all burning out on me. Mybe ill try this guy.

aVIve used the juul, aspire breeze, as sourin drop. The Orion blows them all away by far. 
p254
aVHubby started on a Suorin Air to initially quit smoking. This was his, "Okay, now I want to actually taste the flavor," upgrade that turned into me joking about him being a fog machine.
p255
aVHe started with a Suorin Air salt-nic vape while I started with a Stick Prince Baby by Smok.  I personally liked my starter vape, but he wanted to change because the Suorin doesn't really let you taste the flavor of the juice.\u000a\u000aAs for recommending the same setup, I can't really say yet with the new guys. He got his two days ago and I only got mine today.  If you're looking for a straight up nicotine replacer to go cold turkey from cigs, I'd say start with a Suorin.\u000a\u000aHe and I have only been vaping for a couple of months, so we're still learning as well.\u000a\u000aHope this maybe helps!
p256
aVI think that's the wrong link \U0001f605\u000a\u000aI think a pod system is gonna be your best bet. Look at the Renova Zero, Suorin Air, or similar. With these, you just fill the pod and go, toss it when it tastes bad. And they all have integrated batteries.
p257
aVI used to use one before they started selling bottles of salt nic juice locally. The juice is very satisfying, and it\u2019s really easy to use for newbies. Especially now with how popular it is, Im sure a lot of smokers who don\u2019t know anything about vaping have seen the juul at the gas station and end up getting it because it\u2019s there and they know a lot of people like it. With all of the alternatives that look and feel like the juul but have refillable pods, I really don\u2019t get paying the extra money for the juul.. but my wife just went back to the juul from the sourin drop, and has tried a lot of others and gone back to juul because she says she gets dry hits, very quickly burnt coils, and juice in mouth with everything else. I think it\u2019s operator error, but maybe others have experienced that as well and that leads them to go back to the juul.
p258
aVSame. \u2014 But other salt nic devices exist, and much better juices out there that aren\u2019t made with 10% benzoic acid (which can cause lose of sight or smell). Check out the Suorin air, the pull is also much better than Juul.
p259
aVI don't really know what the deal with benzoic acid is. Is it the same thing as salt nicotine?\u000aYeah i also have a suorin, i love the flavors and larger drag it gives out.
p260
aVMy sourin drop spit 50mg juice straight onto my uvula \u000a\u000aIt was bad

aVlevel up vapor ejuice review\u000a\u000aAfter a while of seeing good reviews for level up vapor's nic salts (mostly from r/juul) I decided to give them a try. I was kind of apprehensive and worried that the reviews weren't totally honest since nearly all of them were so positive but I gave it a shot. I bought a bottle of blue raspberry and mango, both 50mg, a few weeks ago.   \u000a\u000a\u000aI've been using them in my suorin air and have loved them both so far. Blue raspberry kind of reminds me of a blue jolly rancher, with a very slight cooling feeling on the inhale. Not like a menthol though. The cool feeling went away after a while of vaping, maybe because I'm just used to the flavor now.   \u000aThe mango tastes very similar to a real mango, and it's much different from the Juul mango flavor which tastes more artificial to me. It's also kind of like a peachy candy flavor.   \u000aThe flavors aren't extremely strong, but I don't expect as much flavor from nic salts, especially from using a suorin. I've used both flavors for weeks and haven't noticed them burning my pods out any sooner. They last about 2-3 weeks, which is typical. Before trying level up I used naked 100 lava flow, which wasn't bad at all, just not my type of flavor. I also tried mr. salt e blue raspberry lemonade, but there was barely any flavor to me and it burned my pods faster.   \u000a\u000a\u000aThen I tried refilling empty juul pods with the level up, and didn't have a good experience at all. It leaked so much and would barely hit. I figured maybe it's just this particular pod or I didn't refill right (despite refilling pods for a while and never having issues). I tried again with 3 other pods but still had the leaking issue. Maybe it's just me but trying to use level up for my juul wasn't a good experience.   \u000aOverall though, I'd recommend them if anyone's looking to try new nic salt flavors. I haven't ordered any other flavors but I plan on trying more eventually. 
p263
aVPretty common issue with pod devices (at least in my experience) when my suorin drop did that I took it apart, pulled it the correct spot, then superglued it in place and put it back together just make sure to only use enough glue that it stays and not so much it doesnt make a connection 
p264
aVMi pod vs kandypen rubi\u000a\u000aI\u2019m looking for a good device with good flavor that has pods that don\u2019t burn up in like 2 days I have a sourin drop right now and it broke like 2 days and the pods burn out quick it\u2019s honestly the worst pod system I\u2019ve tried yet I like the rubi because it has carbs and you can control the throat hit and it hits more like a juul but I\u2019m curious about the flavor of that compared to the mi pod and how the mi pods airflow compares to the rubi

p267
aVI would go with a pod system but with delivery you really aren\u2019t going to find much unless it\u2019s on sale, and with juice it\u2019s going to be tight. Sourin is 24.99 on sale would be cheaper but I don\u2019t know what you could get with that bank

aVsuorin drop flavor\u000a\u000ai had refilled my drop pod a few days ago and for every day that goes by, it tastes less like mint. it doesn\u2019t taste burnt, and the cottons white. can anyone help?
p269
aVThe instant gratification of salts can be a little addictive and that's an understatement. Like yes of course it's addictive it's nicotine, but I found myself in a hole, I started at 25mg and it sent me spinning I loved the feeling of that buzz, then I got a 35mg juice, and then a 50mg. Now I'm waiting on my order as I'm on 35mg going back down to 25mg. But it's really easy to go out of control with them. I rarely crave my box mods with 3mg juice, but the anxiety I'd get over not remembering if I had my sourin/infinix/etc was bad. All in all, nic salt is great for quitting analogs, but it's easy to get carried away.
p270
aVparticular juice makes me feel short of breath and feels too "heavy"?\u000a\u000anude premium salt makes me feel short of breath and I have to breath heavily in between hits. it is 50 mg and is some fruit flavored stuff. The first juice I used didnt have this issue. the first juice I used was mr. salte with 20mg. I'm hitting it out of a suorin air. 
p271
aVIm a newbie and have only tried ones like juul, sourin drop and vagon, and the SMOK badge. Do you use salt nics or eJuice? I\u2019ve only tried the salts, but like the variety of flavors available in eJuice. I\u2019m really trying to quit smoking cigs and have read people saying that the box mods are the best way to do that. I am leary of the complexity of coils and cotton and the lingo left me confused. I have been doing research and this sub reddit on vaping had been helping me!! I\u2019m actually becoming addicted to this page! Thanks 
p272
aVDo you adjust to a lower nicotine level?\u000a\u000aHi!\u000a\u000aI have a Sourin Air that I use 45mg nic salts with.  My friend had an actual "vape pen" at a party and it tasted better/felt better on my throat so I bought a low budget one with 3mg juice.  I think the Sourin has been affecting my sleep so I am planning on using that just once/one day a week to get a nice buzz and vape 3mg the rest of the time. \u000a\u000aFor those who vape 3mg, do you get any kind of a buzz from it?  And if I stop using the Sourin, would I eventually start getting a buzz from it?

aVSuorin Air Over(?)firing\u000a\u000a Hi all, this is my first time posting here and would love to get y'alls input on my Suorin Air.\u000a\u000aA couple of days ago, I noticed that my Suorin Air wasn't firing as much and, even if I do long drags, I get significantly less smoke than what I was used to (I've owned this Suorin Air for about two full months now). After being disheartened, I watched a couple of videos about cleaning my Suorin and, after a few q-tips and paper towels, I finally got it to work normally again.\u000a\u000aHere's where it gets frustrating... After a couple of days of such great Suorin experience, I notice that it overfires for a good five to six seconds. I'm wondering if this is normal? Is there a fix for this? Am I in danger if I keep using it in this state?\u000a\u000aAny replies would be appreciated. Love the Suorin still though! Helped me quit smoking after 14-15 years!
p274
aVThis is the one and only problem with the suorin, and it\u2019s a well known issue. It WILL leak onto the board, you WILL have to clean it, and it WILL happen again. Hopefully they fix the leaking issue on the next gen. A comparable product that\u2019s not too much larger is the suorin drop, and so far as I\u2019ve heard it doesn\u2019t leak like the air does . Hope that\u2019s helpful! 
p275
aVReceived my Aspire Nautilus AIO today (switched from Suorin Drop). Used the NS coil, filled with 50mg SaltNic, waited ten minutes, and it tastes like burnt plastic! Changed flavors, same nasty taste. Any idea why or how to resolve?\u000a\u000a
p276
aVI wouldn't recommend it. There are a bunch of MTL/Pod Systems now that are amazing. An affordable one that seems to be pretty reliable is the Minifit. There's also the Suorin Drop which I've heard is very good. \u000a\u000aI don't recommend Smok to anyone because in my experience, their coils are garbage. They have less flavor than a lot of other brands and it seems like you'll almost never buy a 5 pack where all 5 coils work well.
p277
aVok, i definitely liked my Suorin Air so i would for sure consider the Suorin Drop. i\u2019ll look into the minifit rn
p278
aVSuorin Drop won\u2019t hit! Brand new\u000a\u000aI got a brand new Suorin drop today and 70/30 juice (it says 30/70 on the bottle but the vape owner said this is the one for the Suorin drop) for it. I let it charge for 20ish mins, the light blinked blue, took it off, filled it, waited about 5 mins, tried to hit, light inside flashed blue, but no vape. I took off the plastic seal btw and tried flipping the pod both directions and still won\u2019t work. It\u2019s not leaking either, some drops came out but even when i clean it all up, still won\u2019t work! There\u2019s some air bubbles in the pod from the juice, but i\u2019m not sure that\u2019s why it won\u2019t release any vapor or how to get rid of the bubbles. Any advice?? ALSO: when i try to inhale from it, the lights turn blue and i can smell the vape juice, but there\u2019s like stops of air through it, how can i fix that??
p279
aVIf you plan on getting into the pod systems I would highly recommend the smok novo or the sourin drop. I've been through many pod systems and they are my two favorites that I've had. And for a juice with menthol that's not overpowering, a good line for that is aqua by marina vapes. They are really good fruity juices and the ice version don't have that overpowering menthol hit. Hope this helps and goodluck on your journey to quit cigs
p280
aVIts my first "salts" mail so i dont know what to expect yet but so far i think its better than a huge vape with huge clouds. I think i like the sourin drop more than my VooPoo Drag. 
p281
aVI switched from Juul to Sourin Air and I've been saving a ton. Being able to pick your own juice and nic strength is great and the pods last about 2-4 refills for me and I can usually get just over a week of life on them.
p282
aVThe Juul Is Dead To Me.\u000a\u000aI switched to the juul from cigs last june. It was a love hate relationship that ended in fiery hate. After 2 devices, hundreds of dollars blown on packs of leaky pods, pod burning problems, device charging/ other battery life problems, and a juul that went into party mode every time i hit it, I finally got rid of mine. After doing so I realized the juul is not very cost efficient either; in new york a pack of pods is 20 dollars, and they'd last me a week- a week and a half depending on how many of the pods completely leaked out (my last pack of cucumber pods 4/4 leaked).\u000a\u000aWith that being said, i'm in the market for a new pod device. Initially my plan was to switch to the Myle, a few of my friends have it and I like the pod flavors and the way it hits, but much to my chagrin Myle issued a statement in the beginning of this month saying they wont be selling their products in the US anymore. Just my luck. In the meantime, my boyfriend has lent me his Suorin air which im vaping rn using a 45 salt nic juice and I don't like the way it hits at all. It might just be due to the flavor (blue raspberry lemonade), but for some reason I find the throat hit feels very burnt, harsh, and not as smooth or satisfying as the juul. I'm using a fresh pod so I know it's not actually burnt, but it just doesn't feel the same. Has anyone else switching from the juul experienced this with the suorin? Should I keep the suorin and experiment with different juice flavors? Or would I be better off trying an entirely new device?\u000a\u000aThe smok novo has caught my eye but i've read mixed reviews about Smok devices on this sub. I'm looking for something thats the closest I can get to a juul in terms of size, simplicity, and throat hit satisfaction. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated, thanks!!!
p283
aVLooking for a new pod system\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve used a few pod systems but I can\u2019t find one that I really like. So far I\u2019ve used the Juul (hated it) battery life is short and pods are expensive. Tried both the Sourin air and Sourin Drop and they were okay but not amazing. Then moved to the SMOK Room Badge and it was good until the magnets that hold the pod in stopped being as strong. Currently using the Aspire Nautilus AIO and the coils don\u2019t last more than a few days because I use Nic Salts. If I want to continue using Nic Salts does anyone have a suggestion of what I should try next? 
p284
aVHow many times can you refill a Novo Pod until it starts to burn? Just wondering since I'm switching from a Sourin Air.
p285
aVI usually chuck tits on a big sub-ohm, but I got this so I can take it around places without it being a hassle.\u000a\u000aI've had it only less than a week but I love it so far. The guy at the B&amp;M said these devices have been the most reliable as far as he's seen so far since it has a button fire instead of the usual drag fire.\u000a\u000aI've had a Suorin Air a few months back (which broke) and I can say that my first impression for this is a lot better. 
p286
aVI've been saying this since forever and nobody believes Me.\u000a\u000aThis is the most underrated device ever and cheap as balls.\u000a\u000aPeople are drooling over orions, juuls suorin and other crap while this cheap pod just keeps chugging and it's cheap too.

aVSuggestions for a newbie??\u000a\u000aWhich would you suggest ? I\u2019ve had sourin drop which got stolen, bought the badge to replace that. No issues except I liked the feel of the drop better but the badge seems to hit easier. Then got a vagon and not liking the amount of lung power to get anything. I\u2019m fairly new to this and thought about trying a mod or stick to start. I want to switch exclusively from cigs. I have only been using nic salts 25mg as these are pod vapes. I tried 50 once but someone said you lose flavor when you go up in nic. Sometimes I mix the two together? \u000aI literally know very little about mods and vaping but from what I\u2019m reading others say, my considerations have been...... SMOK stick v8? Aspire Breeze or Nautilus? SMOK baby alen. Wanna start smaller and work up if need be. Any help would be greatly appreciated!!! \u000a\u000aP.S. If you\u2019d like to add your fav juice brand and flavors that would be awesome. Bought a few and it\u2019s been hit or miss. More of a miss actually:(

aVSince quitting cigarettes I've had Mouth To Lung devices. Old ones I can't even remember because they are off market. They mostly come from shenzen.. China. Great stuff but short lasting. \u000a\u000aMost recently:\u000aSuorin Air - 4 month lifespan\u000aSuorin Drop - 4 month lifespan\u000aSuorin Drop - 2 month lifespan\u000a\u000aAnd now I have the Smok NOVO. \u000aThe pod works way better than suorin pods.

aVNeed help finding the right vape for me\u000a\u000aI'm relatively new to vaping but the nicotine has been helping me with my depression. I've never had a device of my own, but I often use my friends' devices (juuls and suorins) and I'm looking to buy a device of my own. However, I'm not a big fan of either of these devices that I've used because they don't have the longevity that I'm looking for. Juuls constantly require new pods and the coils for suorins seem to burn out after a week of use. I'm looking for a device that won't burn out on me after a short period of time and something that I won't have to constantly keep buying pods or cartridges for to keep using. I don't know much about vape devices, but I'm wondering if anyone on this subreddit might know of a device that would be good for me. 
p290
aVTons of options out there. Let me suggest the lost vape Orion. It's a 'premuim' pod device typically around $75. But breazy vape has them for 39.99 right now. Still uses cartridges like the sourins, but the chip it has in it knows when your low on juice and will limit the voltage output to keep from burning or dry hitting. Therefore, prolonging the life of a single cartridge. \u000a\u000aNow another thing, if it's mainly for depression then I would look into CBD oil (honestly you don't even have to vape it, you can apply it in a few drops under your tongue) but if you want to vape it you can. You can put it in pods or regular box mods. CBD oil helps a variety of things such as, anxiety, depression, stress, fatigue, ect. \u000a\u000aHope this helps. 
p291
aVMy mom is a vape nazi she is convinced that it's going to ruin everything in her house if I vape anywhere near it she is one of those people that just doesn't understand that that's not how it works, so I got a little sourin air hoping it would make her or stop making my visit annoying, after all she's my mom and I love her, lol
p292
aVInterested in an Orion, seen mixed reviews, need some advice from users please!\u000a\u000aHey all! I\u2019m not much of a vaper. I only use pod systems for the nicotine and don\u2019t do big ol mods and tanks and what not. I\u2019ve had many JUULs, Suorins, Smok Novo (my least favorite), smok infinix, and Renova Zeros (my favorite, bought three they\u2019re so amazing).\u000a\u000aI just mention those to possibly get a comparison. I\u2019m thinking of buying a Lost Vape Orion tomorrow, and I know they\u2019re hyped up, and hopefully it could be my last purchase for a while. I usually vape 50-55mg salts, but is that too high to be safe in the Orion 0.5 coil? It\u2019s amazing looking. I will never use freebase juices in it, I don\u2019t vape for clouds or anything, just like them for a replacement for an old chewing habit. I usually buy pod systems and hope they\u2019re good but this one is over double the price of any other ones so I wanted to get a few opinions of people who have had it a while. My local shop usually has advice on devices but they just got them in and they don\u2019t know too much either yet. Thanks in advance guys! Sorry I\u2019ve seen a lot of posts here on the Orion but none were very specific and just hand checks or from new users, and now I think there\u2019s a lot of people who have had theirs for a while.

p294
aVI looked it up and the LD50 is 0 5-1mg/kg in humans(it's 50mg/kg in rats, which is just a bit higher lol)\u000a\u000aSo that would mean 15% of my suorin pod in one sitting would kill me. So I guess I'll have to be careful since I've definitely gone through that much before.\u000a\u000aI don't think I'd be a problem though since I would definitely be extremely dizzy way before then.
