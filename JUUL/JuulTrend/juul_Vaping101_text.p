VMy juul has disappeared in my car
p1
aVAll of the devices here are sub par pod systems with the exception of the Juul.. I only say that because it works but is extremely expensive for most users.. The way they describe Smok products is complete and utter BS.. Same goes for Sourin. I'm not saying I have all the knowledge of pod systems but I have enough to know there are FAR better systems that should've made this list.  These wouldn't have even made my top 20.        It almost seems like they paid to have these on here given how ludacris this list is... I would recommend the Innokin EQ, The MI-pod or The Smoant S8.. Those are my top three and either one of them will serve you well, My Friend.

aVEver wondered how much the Juul (or other closed/non-refillable) is costing you vs a refillable pod system? Come on in, I ran the numbers! (And they don't look good...)
p3
aVHad a Juul, price was coming out to that of 3 packs of cigarettes for 4 pods. I was saving 1 pack of cigarettes. Went to a Breeze 2 system for 2 people, comes out to \u005c~$20 for a 30ml bottle every week to a week and a half. So instead of $17 every \u005c~2 days, it goes to around $60 a month effectively saving over $100 a month. I feel Juul would be a better system if the pods weren't nearly as much as a pack of cigarettes themselves.
p4
aVGreat write-up! I\u2019ve never bought a Juul for this very reason. I always try to tell my friends how much cheaper it is, but maybe they\u2019re just too lazy to fill it up or try something new. I\u2019m currently using the sourin air and it\u2019s just as satisfying as the Juul imo
p5
aVThey don\u2019t need to lower their prices because they sell a shitload of them. What juul sells is convenience. 150 bucks over the course of a year isn\u2019t really much to a person that doesn\u2019t want to bother with buying juice and filling their own pods. 
p6
aVFor most people that use reddit they already know this and aren\u2019t gonna use a juul. \u000a\u000aConvenience is pretty important tho. I mean you can get that cost down to about hmmm 80 for the year using salts on a rebuidable instead of a pod. 
p7
aVThat\u2019s why I switched to juul. \u000a
p8
aVSince your mom isn't buying it for herself then I would go with something that is super super easy to use AND (this is the important part) she can refill as easily as she would buy a new pack of cigarettes. I think that means you should stick to a pod system, and one carried in gas stations, drug stores, and supermarkets. Hopefully she likes it so much, and is so impressed by how easy it is, and how much better she feels coming off combustion products, that she leaves the cigarettes behind. If she wants to branch out with more customizable (or cheaper refill) options, that can be something she does after she gets used to vaping instead of smoking. \u000a\u000aLook for a Juul, Blu, MarkTen, etc... 
p9
aVLooking for something other than a JUUL
