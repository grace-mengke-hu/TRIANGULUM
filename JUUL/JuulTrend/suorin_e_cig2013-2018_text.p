VIphone Manufacturer Foxconn Starts to Produce E-cigar Now? iPhone Level Quality?\u000a\u000aYesterday I came across an interesting vape gear on some forums which is said to be produced by Foxconn. I know this manufacturer is famous for producing iPhone, but now an e-cigar? Lol...a little bit curious if it has the same quality with iPhone. According to the description, it is called as Suorin Air, dimension is only 88*45*8mm, seems pretty thin and can be completely hidden in your palm. 2ml e-liquid capacity, 400mAh battery, pretty much like an entry-level device. It doesn't look like a vape device actually. But personally, I like this cool design. Currently I only found these simple parameters...no info about coil resistance, or how to replace the coil? What kind of coil does it use...etc. If you guys know anything, please kindly share.

aVSuorin air pod burnt after just a few hits?\u000a\u000aI have been using a suorin air for a couple months and it has worked fine until the past couple days. I have tried 3 pods and they are all burnt within a few hits even after i let it sit for about half an hour after filling it up with juice. Is there any reason this is happening or am i just having bad luck with pods?

aVSuorin Drop - Uneven expenditure of juice\u000a\u000aI was wondering why my Suorin Drop would be using more juice from one side than the other, and if this has an overarching effect on how often I need to refill it. I can\u2019t seem to find a way to force the juice to even out.\u000a\u000aEdit: I did find a way to even out the sides, as opening both juice entrances allowed the air to flow out and in, allowing for the juice levels to balance out. However, I am still wondering as to why this would be an issue, and if it is problematic.

aVBuy a suorin 
p10
aVHelp purchasing first ecig\u000a\u000aI've recently been looking to buy my first all-in-one device as I'm trying to quit smoking.  I am looking for something small and portable that will get me through the day. I've heard good things about the Suorin Air and Aspire Breeze.  I've also looked at the iCare 2 but heard pretty consistent negative reviews about it. A lot of my friends have a Juul, but I'd rather stay away from that to have something easier to refill with juices. I'd appreciate any feedback with experiences that you may have had with these or something similar that you'd recommend. Thanks!
p11
aV&gt; I've heard good things about the Suorin Air\u000a\u000aThey've been lying to you, albeit unknowingly. Do a search for them on this subreddit. Roughly half a dozen posts each day about them breaking in various ways. Twice that when high school isn't in session.\u000a\u000aJuul is a popular pod system. You don't have to refill it or anything, just put a new pod in.\u000a\u000aPersonally, I feel the refillable kits to be worth the savings.\u000a\u000a

aVBought a Suorin Drop today...juice has no flavor whatsoever. Would switching to salts help?\u000a\u000a[deleted]
p14
aVI got a brand new Suorin Air and it has not worked except for a few hits.  Got some regular juice from the place that sold the Air and they acted like it would be fine.\u000a\u000aOn the hits that did work, it was very harsh on the throat and it was hot to the lips if you kept pulling.  The coil is not burnt at all or anything. But literally every single hit is a misfire.  Barely hits and then starts blinking.  Honestly ridiculous.  Waste of money so far.  Is it the juice thats a problem or the device?

aVReccomendations for Nic-Salt MTL devices?\u000a\u000atl;dr: reccomend nicotine salt devices. \u000a\u000aI currently own a DRAG and Druga. I'm looking for something that I can take to work. I had a JUUL for about 8 months and it recently died - finally. I didn't like the juul since I couldn't refill the pods. I tried multiple times but the pod would burn very quickly and become useless. I've been looking at devices like the suorin drop, and air. As well as possibly picking up a MTL RTA and building it high and using salt liquid in it. I wanted to get reccomendations from all of you guys first.
p17
aVSuorin Air. I can\u2019t recommend the Breeze or similar.. changing flavors isn\u2019t easy and spit back is a pain. Air never leaks or has spit back given the design. Easy to swap pods for other flavors... and dirt cheap. 
p18
aV+1, since I've had the air it's out paced all other pod devices I own.  However, since I've bought the air, the suorin drop has been released and it's an upgrade however it's more expensive
p19
aVSuorin drop\u000a\u000aI just got the Suorin Drop yesterday and it was working great. That is, until it stopped ripping. It keeps flashing blue when I try to draw. Charged for 30 minutes and no dice. Anyone know a fix to this?
p20
aVI'd recommend the suorin drop over the juul, you get to pick out of many more flavors and it's much higher quality

aVBlue light still on after I took sourin drop apart. I hate the drop , bought it brand new put in juice in it, let it settle. A couple hours later the blue light turns on forever almost unless I hit it then it would turn red\u000a\u000a[deleted]

p24
aVHow many fills are sourin drop pods good for?\u000a\u000aI heard like 3 or 4 fills I just got mine today
p25
aVHeres what I dont understand about the Sourin or JUUL\u000a\u000aThey both use extremely high nicotine content. 40 and 25mg? Wtf? I thought 12 was pretty high, wouldnt 40 make you nic sick in two hits or do those devices vape liquid at a slower rate?
p26
aVMaybe switch to a MTL device like the Suorin Drop and fill it with salts.  50mg should satisfy cravings and the salts aren't as harsh.
p27
aVPicked up two Sourin air v1 pods and one has a light burnt taste while the other hasn\u2019t a chemically taste\u000a\u000ai waited 30 minutes to prime the juice in the pod but no luck. Is it because it\u2019s a v1 pod and not a v2 pod? My first sourin pod was great but this ian making me think about going back to juul and it\u2019s bad pods :(

They are sold out of Drops.\u000a\u000aAlso, can I hit the Air while I am charging?\u000a\u000aAnything else I should know?\u000a\u000a
p36
aVOwned a Suorin Air. The Suorin Drop is a much better design. However, I have since switched to an Aspire Breeze due to lack of pods in my area. Definitely Drop &gt; Air though.
p37
aVIf you're trying to save money, I would not go with a juul. I've gone through a pod in a day and it starts to add up. I recently just bought a Suorin Drop and I am liking it very much. It has refillable pods so you can get juice that you enjoy the most (recommend going with nic salt based juice). Bought mine for $35 and after refilling the pods around 5 times they get bad so you'll need to pick new ones up. I think you can get them online for $3 a piece or a shop near me sells the pods for $5 a piece. Overall, would recommend over the juul. The drop is also very discrete you can hide it easily in your hand when you hit it.
p38
aVLove my Suorin Air, running some bombies cold press at 40mg. Highly recommend. 
p39
aVVape Pods are becoming more and more popular for (not the size of a light saber) or portable vapes. I just got the Suorin Drop and I've been pretty pleased with it so far. But I do know that [Pods](https://www.ecigaretteempire.com/collections/vape-pods) arn't for everyone, some people like to have that bulky bigger set up. As for juice I always refer people to [here](https://www.ecigaretteempire.com/collections/e-juice-brands) because I simply haven't been able to find better deals anywhere and they generally are always in stock of my Bam Bam's that I vape religiously lol. You can always check JuiceDB to find great deals as well 
p40
aVFor juice I would recommend Blue Dot Vapors. You can get 100ml of juice for $18. Depending on how much you vape that 100ml could last you anywhere from a week to a month.\u000a\u000aTo give some examples on usage.. When I'm working I take a Suorin Drop with 45mg nicotine salts and vape maybe 2mls over the whole day. This is because it is a low power device so I use a higher nicotine concentration so I can get my fix quick without blowing massive clouds all over. \u000a\u000aWhen I'm home I typically use a Smoant Charon device with a Uwell Crown 3 tank with 6mg nicotine juice. It depends on the day but if I'm home all day I may end up going through 20mls if not more. This is because it's a higher powered device with a lower nicotine concentration. This way I just casually vape through the day, blow some clouds and enjoy the flavor of the juice.\u000a\u000aSo two very different ends of the spectrum for two different kinds of need. I would highly recommend the Crown 3 tank, it looks nice, vapes great and I haven't had any issues with it. Coils are a few bucks each and with care typically last me 2-3 weeks before needing replacement. The Charon device is great but I wouldn't recommend it as a first device. It has glass on both sides and a large touch screen. Add in the very hefty weight and I don't even want it to accidentally knock it over and chance breaking the glass. Hence that device never leaves the house. \u000a\u000aIt can be overwhelming getting into it. Especially now with so many different options. I was overwhelmed even back in 2013 when I first started learning about vaping. Nowadays there is much more support, the products are better and it's much easier to make the change. Stick to it, once you've got a good setup going you'll never want to look back.

aVCrackling sound from suorin whenever I take a hit.\u000a\u000aI accidentally dropped my Suorin and now every time I take a hit, there is a loud consistent cracking sound, do any of y'all know what this means?

p43
aVUsually I use a JUUL but I've been partial to the [Suorin Air](http://www.infinitevapor.com/The-Suorin-Air_p_404.html) lately. Perfect stealth vape since it's smaller than my drivers license and the flavor is surprisingly good.

aVAre there any decent coffee flavor nic salts?\u000a\u000aHi all, I hope this is the correct place to post this!\u000a\u000aIn an effort to quit cigarettes I picked up a box mod vape a few months back. I enjoyed playing with the clouds for a while but I soon realized that it didn't do much for my nicotine cravings. Then I started using my girlfriend's Juul and I loved it. However, the pods were expensive, and I wanted to get something like the Juul for myself. I ended up picked up a Sourin Drop a few days ago and I really like it. It gives me a nice throat hit, and due to the high nicotine levels I really don't feel like smoking cigarettes anymore (yay!). \u000a\u000a\u000aWhen I was using the Juul I really liked the mint and creme brulee flavors. The creme brulee really just tasted like coffee to me and I loved it. I've been searching online trying to find a good coffee flavored nic salt with around 50 mg levels but it seems like most flavors are custards and various fruits. I got the Mr. Salt-E strawberry custard flavor as it was the only non-fruit flavor they had in the store and its OK, but doesn't really satisfy my cravings for a good coffee flavor.\u000a\u000aDoes anybody know of any reputable companies that produce a flavor that tastes like the Juul's creme brulee flavor? Or something like a sweet coffee flavor?
p45
aVVgod box mod 150w. Just a solid device overall. I've yet to have any problems with it in these 6 months while having it as my daily driver. Still looks mint as heck and I love the shape and simplicity it has.\u000a\u000a\u000aAlso shoutout to my Suorin Air. Found the pod i'll probably be sticking with for a long while. Compact, beautiful experience and most of all convenient as hell ( 30 minute charge time with a day or two of use!!!? )
p46
aVFor me it is the suorin air. No problems, easy to use and very convenient. 
p47
aVThe Suorin Air. I've been using VW devices with RDAs for a few years, and I picked up the Suorin on a whim a few months back. Paired with a good nic-salt juice, the throat hit is the closest thing that I (personally) have found to a real cigarette. The battery life is surprisingly great for a device it's size, I manage a vape shop and I can get through a full 8-hour day only having to charge it once, if at all. Not to mention, having a device that can still give me a head rush is a rarity these days. And it's much less cumbersome than my other devices.
p48
aVSmoant Battlestar. However the device that made the biggest difference has been the Suorin Air. It finally got my girl off cigs because it's tiny and cute. I'm not a fan of pod like devices but it did the most important thing in getting someone to quit cigarettes. That's what is most important in any device. 
p49
aVIm thinking about getting a pod based MTL device, because I chug and MTL through my sub-ohm tank like no ones business and going through 10 mL a day. I\u2019m stuck between the Suorin Air and the Suorin Drop. I\u2019m leaning more towards the Air, mostly because of looks, and I\u2019ve heard the Drop\u2019s pods are sometimes loose. What would you guys recommend?
p50
aVHave you not seen the Sourin posts in the sub?
p51
aVI don\u2019t know that you have. There are at least 5 Sourin complaint posts a day on here. I don\u2019t think you want to go with one of those.

aVDamn I\u2019m really bummed Suorin is AIDS. A dude at my local B&amp;M showed me his a month or two ago and I fell in love but haven\u2019t gotten it yet, and kind of glad I haven\u2019t 
p53
aVOk because the main reason I want to switch is I\u2019m not getting enough of a kick from 6mg subohm anymore, but 12mg destroys my throat. after trying a buddy\u2019s juul I wanted a device meant for MTL because I already MTL my subohm tank. Thanks for your help though, definitely appreciate it because I probably would\u2019ve gotten a Suorin

p62
aVI might try this out and add nic salts for my pocketable vapes like the Suorin Air. \u000a\u000aPurely nostalgic for me. I got into vaping after a surgery and quit smoking - since I couldn\u2019t smoke indoors and couldn\u2019t walk much for weeks. The first juice I got was a Baja Blast from a local vendor. \u000a\u000a
p63
aVI recently switched to a Suorin Air and nic salt juice...So easy and cheap. I'm never going back to my "cloud bro" setups
p64
aVI own both a sourin air and a box mod. I like alternating between the two because they both have unique characteristics. It also gives me a break between vaping the same flavor so I never get vapers tongue like I use to.
p65
aVI'm using the suorin air right now as well until my aspire Zelos comes in the mail Tuesday (first real mod). Battery is great and as long as you aren't chain vaping a cartridge should last about a week. It puts out some big hits so 3 pulls of some strong nic salt juice and i get a buzz that holds me off for a good amount of time. I'll keep it around to bring on campus and when going out while i leave the mod at home. form factor is perfect to slide into my pocket and nobody can even tell its a vape, even those who actually are familiar with vaping.

aVI have a breeze and and an Icare 2 and a sourin air. Get a breeze if you upgrade.
p68
aVI am in the same place you are, maybe a month or two ahead. I have pretty much retired my fleet of kanger subtanks and have almost fully replaced them with 2 Suorin Airs and 2 Suorin Drops. I ran across this comparison but not sure who owns it.\u000a http://www.podmodvaping.com/analytics.html\u000a\u000aI am sticking with the Suorins for now, but looking for something with longer battery life. The damn thing is so small though, I just carry two and they're still more convenient than a tank, extra juice, extra batteries etc. I am very interested in the Sigelei Compak OB One (previously Compak M) but am waiting for more reviews before I pull the trigger. \u000a\u000aThe pods are expensive, but the tradeoff in juice consumption for me is making up for it. If used correctly, a pod can be filled 3-5 times or more and I'm using a fraction of the juice. Even with heavy usage, 2-4ml of high nic salt juice will easily last an entire day. \u000a\u000a
p69
aVQuite honestly.. those are pretty garbage. For something small and cheap for the go, just get the Suorin Air. The breeze and iCare have issues with spit back. And changing the flavors in those things is a hassle. With the Air, you have separate pods so you can just swap flavors on the go. 
p70
aVLook for a sale and grab a few, once you know you like the Suorin Air, get more. :)\u000a\u000aI just pulled the trigger on the Compak OB One. Great deal on Heaven Gifts, but will likely take several weeks to arrive...
p71
aVHave had zero issues with it. When or where did you buy it? Or what kind of juice are you using in it? I\u2019ve legit never had any pods that were bad outside the old design. The previous version was garbage and I got rid of it. Basically the V2 has temperature control and different pods. \u000a\u000ahttp://vaping360.com/suorin-air/\u000a\u000aI threw away the first one I had. I also tossed the Drop since it\u2019s dog shit.

aVI\u2019ve work for a shop and have used both the Mi-Pod and the Suorin Drop. Of course there is mAh difference between the two, the Mi-Pod being a 950mAh and the Drop a 350mAh. I bought the Drop and have used it for a week straight, only having charged it once and just finished my first fill up on my pod last night. I\u2019d say flavor wise, the Suorin Drop has the best flavor.
p74
aVSuorin Drap is very nice.

p80
aVPlease let me know how this is! I just bought a Suorin Drop and have found that it hits great with good flavor but after a couple refills of the pod I have been getting a burnt taste. I have around 5-6 replacement pods and with 2 left have been slowly realizing that I have not yet found the Juul-replacement I was looking for.\u000a\u000aThe Dolphin looks sweet and is in the same price range. Would really like to be satisfied with the product of choice so I'd really appreciate hearing your feedback after a couple of days!!

aVSuorin air keeps firing\u000a\u000aHey all - So as the title says, I have a Suorin Air and the thing keeps firing after I stop pulling on it. I've done some Googling and the consensus seems to be clean it, which I did. I used some rubbing alcohol and Mother's on a q-tip, cleaned the contacts and also pulled the electronics out of the housing and cleaned that with a dry cloth. I also changed the pod. Twice. The damn thing STILL auto fires after I pull, so I've reduced myself to having to pull and click it off between pulls. Now, it doesn't do it EVERY time, but enough that I've burned two pods before figuring out the clicking it off thing. \u000a\u000aAnyone had any luck besides buying another one?
p82
aVJuul or iCare. You can\u2019t fix an auto firing Sourin as the multitude of other posts on here about the same issue have already dealt with this issue.

aVSuorin Drop Burnt Pod Fix\u000a\u000aYerrrr so I recently got a Suorin Drop. The pod started to burn my juice after just 2 weeks. I just ordered a new one but there\u2019s no shot I can abstain from nic for the next week so I started to play around with the pod. Also this will probably work with a Suorin Air too. Here\u2019s what I did:\u000a\u000a1) Emptied out the juice in my pod. (It was all black yuck)\u000a\u000a2) Rinsed the pod under warm water for a few minutes. Really played around with it and made sure it was full with water than blew it out.\u000a\u000a3) Dried the outside with a napkin and then proceeded to dry the inside with a hairdryer. Don\u2019t think I did it thorough enough but if you do it thorough enough it might work better. \u000a\u000a4) refilled the pod with just a little bit of juice (only fill enough to soak the cotton because I ended up not vaping any of it and wasting it all.\u000a*Make sure the cotton is soaked when you fill. This is what causes it in the first place. A method of doing this is just blowing in and out on the pod and letting it sit there for a couple minutes.\u000a\u000a6) Popped the pod in the suorin pod. Do like 20 short, quick mouth hits. This will take all the remaining water out. It ended up leaking all of the residue burnt black liquid out. So be careful. Make sure you clean your device if it gets in there.\u000a\u000a7) got a napkin and held it at the end and blew the rest of the burnt liquid out. (Ended up leaking out all the good liquid too) Now I have a truly clean pod.\u000a\u000a8) now refill like normal and again, make sure the cotton is soaked.\u000a\u000aTADAAA good as new.\u000a\u000a

aVsuorin air ~~users~~ kids FTFY\u000a\u000a
p86
aVJudging from the last few days.... suorin air is a bad bet.\u000a\u000aMy first shitpost?\u000a\u000aBut seriously it\u2019s a simple, cheap device if it malfunctions buy another. \u000a\u000aEdit: or buy something that doesn\u2019t suck instead. 
p87
aVI was debating making this shitpost myself. \u000a\u000aBut holy shit it's like the alien all over again. There were literally **4** sourin posts in a row the last time I sorted by new....
p88
aVI don't want to be accused of being a shill for Suorin Air but really all these negative posts surprise me. We've sold about 100 of them and have not had a single complaint (other than not being able to keep the pods in stock). I looked at the posts today and it seems like every 3rd or 4th post is a negative Suorin post. \u000a\u000aIt may be that it's very popular for the underage crowd. The biggest (and only) complaint we've had is that our juice doesn't give a good enough buzz from the Suorin Air buyers. This has only happened a few times but it's enough that even if our 3rd party age verification passes you, we still ask for a picture of your ID.\u000a\u000aEdit...we really have gotten a couple of nasty emails about not getting a buzz from Suorins.
p89
aVI wish I could just filter out the word Suorin from all of reddit and be done with it already.\u000a\u000aThat would be my Christmas miracle. 
p90
aVI know 4 or 5 people who got one just when they were introduced, and I did also.  I have not had a single problem and neither have they.\u000a\u000aI'm thinking that Suorin screwed up when they ramped up production.  Maybe a different assembly process or maybe cheaper parts.  There's no denying that there currently seems to be a problem but from my little world it was once a decent pod system.\u000a\u000aIt's a shame, especially for all the people who wasted their money on the recommendations of the early adopters.  They weren't lying to you - I don't think the Air that's for sale today is the same as what it was.
p91
aVSuorin Air Malfunction\u000a\u000aHey, I\u2019m new to this sub but I\u2019ve come to y\u2019all in a time of despair. Just bought a Suorin Air about a week ago, and have loved it thus far. However, after taking it on a plane today, juice leaked from the cartridge, and my entire Suorin stopped functioning. When I turn It on, I can not hit it, but occasionally the blue light will start flashing repeatedly and begins firing without me inhaling, thus wasting my cartridge. I have left it to dry, tried cleaning all contacts and juice away, blowing through the hole, and just about everything else while trying to work it. I don\u2019t know what to do at this point and am unfamiliar with the company\u2019s replacement policy. Someone please help, it would be greatly appreciated!
p92
aVSuorin drop auto firing. Constant red light.\u000a\u000aI plugged it into my car to charge it and when i took it off it just has a constant red light and is auto firing. Anyone know how to fix it?
p93
aVAnother suorin that's malfunctioning? No fuckin way!
p94
aVSourin Air Problem\u000a\u000aI just got this sourin air 3 weeks ago. My second pod started to burn out and it started to hit on its own after pulling out it. It hits till the point the sourin cuts  out for hitting too long. I bought a new pod and it still does the same thing. I cleaned out the contacts and even took the Air apart and cleaned it. Anyone have a solution? 
p95
aVKandyPens Feather - Burnt Pod\u000a\u000aHi all - I've tried searching the internet for feedback on this, but have found nothing! I just got a feather a few days ago for nic salts juice. The guy at the store told me that the pods are supposed to last way longer than suorin pods because they have ceramic coils, so I went with the feather for something new. I let the juice sit for 30 min like recommended when I first got it, and now after just 2 refills, the coil tastes burnt. I've gotten a few hits of burnt juice throughout the last few days, but they're random. Now, all the hits are burnt, but the pod is only a couple of days old. Anyone know what may be the issue?
p96
aVit was only like $15 more than the suorin drop. My friends love their k vape so i thought i'd give it a try.
p97
aVI would recommend a suorin or a vaporesso
p98
aVSuorin air Flashing Blue Light but still hits?\u000a\u000aGetting a flashing light whenever I turn the device on, when the pod is in or not.  I've cleaned the inside and the connection points.  Device still hits normally.  Does't fire by itself either.    
p99
aVSuorin air pods\u000a\u000aSo i recently switched over to a sourin because my Icare burnt through coils like crazy.  I bought it 2 weeks ago and Im already on me second burnt coil.  I don't rip it that much, probably like 6 times every 2-3 hours and my coil is already burnt.  could it be that my juice is causing this?  I'm using crft mint, I've asked some buddies that also have sourins and they rip it constantly(way more than I do) and they said that they have only burnt their coils once during the multiple months they've had it.  I would love any feedback and or help with this because it's really starting to annoy me.\u000aThis is what the coil looks like after i bought it yesterday\u000ahttp://imgur.com/gSCzDfc

aVSuorin air crackling and poping each hit.\u000a\u000a[deleted]
p101
aVWhy is the Suorin Air so popular?  Seems like everyday there are multiple topics about them malfunctioning.  I don't get it.
p102
aVNot enough info to go off of. Do they want something that drags sort of like a cigarette? Then the dolphin or suorin drop would probably be a good starter.\u000aI, like many others, started with an Aspire pen-styled vape with... I think a nautilus mini(?) on it. That worked well for a while, but a year or so down the line I moved on to a simple af internal battery tesla that was capable of sub-ohm direct to lung puffs. Basically, you'd need to know what they're after and if they'd even be able to stick with it or if they'd go back to smoking.
p103
aVWhat common household liquids (Besides VG or PG) can be used in a Suorin air pod if im out of juice?\u000a\u000aIt doesn't even have to taste good or have Nic or anything, my juice Is coming in another week and I don't think I can wait that long without taking a hit of anything from my vape. 
p104
aVThere's an on and off switch on the Suorin Air. Also, did you charge it?
p105
aVSuorin Air Hitting By Itself\u000a\u000aHi everyone, I'm having a problem where my suorin air will start hitting by itself when simply switched to the on position. The light will come on and the suorin air will start producing vapor without me even hitting it, which I think is making the pods burn out. Has anyone else had this problem or know a fix for it? Thanks. 
p106
aVThe Suorin Air gets roughly 50 complaint posts a day. It's a piece of shit designed for underage people. \u000a\u000aTry something else. 
p107
aVAny recommendations for an extremely portable vaporizer that is refillable the same way the suorin is (that isn't a box mod)?
p108
aVjuul or suorin

aVI went through about 3 Ghosticks within a month (my fault for losing or breaking them, amazing vaporizer) and am now using a Suorin Drop. 
p110
aVIm excited to give my mom a suorin drop because she should quit smoking

aVIs $40 for a suorin air worth it?\u000a\u000a[deleted]
p117
aVYesterday's bowel movement is too much for a Suorin Air.\u000a\u000aUnless you're underage and can't get one yourself legally.
p118
aVSuorin Air Problems\u000a\u000aI got the Suorin Air a couple days ago and I am already on my third pod, due to the pods burning. I let both of them prime for at least 20 minutes before using. They both worked fine for a while and then I start getting burnt hits. Any ideas why this is happening?
p119
aVBecause the Suorin Air is likely a piece of shit designed for the underage crowd.\u000a\u000aDo a search. There's only been a few hundred complaints this week.
p120
aVThere are some youtube hacks on how to fix that problem. The Suorin Drop is great, btw, in case you're thinking about switching. Pods are lasting me a month each on average, very smooth hit and super stealth - totally silent, not even a slight whistle.
p121
aVI'm enjoying the Suorin Drop as well. Was going to replace my week old pod, but it's still going, so I'm going to see how much longer I get out of it.
p122
aVFor the Suorin Drop pod, I stuck a paper clip and fan the cotton out a little bit. I don't know how easy it is to do for the Air pods. Also, don't fill it to the brim. I leave a little bit of room for air bubbles so it won't vacuum lock.
p123
aVI need advice on the suorin air.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m planning on getting one very soon and only 3-6 mg juice. My question is lets say I have melon flavor juice and use it all in the pod, can I put a different juice in there or I have to keep using the same one till I get a new pod where I can put new juice?
p124
aVWhy anyone would get a Juul when the Suorin Air exists is beyond me.  Well I guess brand recognition and convenience. 
p125
aVCan I ask how long you've been using the Suorin Air? I bought one and 3 pods for it. The first pod started dry hitting on the 2nd fill but the other 2 have been fine. i want to order a couple more but there are so many negative comments here I feel like I'm a drag or two away from failure.
p126
aVThe reason why they're so addictive is because of the Benzoic acid they put into the juices. The 5% nicotine is equal to 59mg nic/ ML per pod. \u000a\u000aThe benzoic acid is that allows the nicotine to be absorbed into the body at a much faster rate. Hence why the consumer always receives the experience of their first cigarette after hitting the juul for the first time of the day. Every. Day.\u000a\u000a https://support.juulvapor.com/home/learn/faqs/juulpods-juice    -     Sauce \u000a\u000aI manage multiple vape shops and receiving 25+ calls a day about juul pods can easily be aggravating . \u000a\u000aAlso, a customer is paying 16.99-19.99$+ for a pack of pods. In each pod is 0.7 ML , so they're paying close to $20 for 2.4ML of juice. That's over $170 for a freaking 30ML!!!! I want to feel sympathy for the juul users, and I try to explain the math to my customers but a lot are too intransigent to switch to a Suorin or a breeze.
p127
aVHow many refills can you get out of the pods? Do you have a Juul as comparison? It\u2019s caught my eye however every Juul alternative I\u2019ve tried so far is now collecting dust. I\u2019m looking for a similar draw. Any leaking issues? I saw that suorin also has a new device coming out called the ishare (stick device with pcc). 
p128
aVRight now just my suorin before i get my next full size mod in a few weeks. I'm looking at either the Wismec cb-60 or joyetech exceed box kit. I'm a MTL kinda guy if you have any other suggestions for a reasonable first kit
p129
aVSourin Air has no flavor.\u000a\u000aThis is now frustrating. I let my pods sit for 25 minutes and took a few dry hits. I even have tried different juices. All just give me a warm taste with no flavor. Any help would be greatly apprecaited!
p130
aVDoes the blue light up when you pull on the bottom of your sourin? 
p131
aVStrange. If you\u2019ve tried other pods and other juices and it still hits dry then maybe it\u2019s your sourin that\u2019s messed up. How long have you had it? 
p132
aV Have you tried using a new pod?  I've never personally tried Mr. Salt-E but I've also never had issues with lack of flavor on the Suorin Air.  I've gone through about 5 cartridges myself and tried about 12 flavors without any issues. 
p133
aVI have a feeling it\u2019s your sourin that\u2019s the issue. Maybe contact them and see if you can get a replacement? Sorry dude that sucks \U0001f622
p134
aVvaporesso aurora but you cant find them anymore,     \u000aSuorin drop.
p135
aVThe Suorin Air and Suorin Drop are very popular amongst nic salt vapers in our experience.  
p136
aVI've been getting along great with the Suorin Drop. Could be a case of winning the QC lottery, can't rule that out yet. Most of the complaints here point to the Suorin Air.
p137
aVMy mom was similar. Smoked for many years and didn't like the ego I got her a year or so ago. Got her a suorin drop recently and she likes it so far. Still has a few cigs occasionally but it's simple and doesn't need many hits as long as you're using a salt based e liquid. I've tried the drop too and I think it's pretty smooth. I can't comment on battery life yet as my mom doesn't use it frequently but it charges fairly quick. 
p138
aVHello yesterday I ordered suorin air replacement pods and I just wanna know how long does it take for them to ship it out and has anyone orderd from their site\u000a\u000a

aVGood evening few more days left at work. Oh the excitement.  Ohh and today has been full of cringe from the kids running in here with their sourin air issues and busted capes. Lol
p142
aVI've used the following:\u000a\u000a* **Suorin Air**  - refillable 2ml pods are nice. One went bad on the 2nd fill, but the other 2 I've tried lasted longer. Lots of posts about these failing. So far so good but I want to find a replacement.\u000a\u000a* **Phix** - I liked this device a lot, and really enjoyed the Butterscotch Tobacco but the pods spit back and leak to the point I was constantly blowing through it to clear juice before using.\u000a\u000a* **iCare v1** - hated this, constant dry hits and just bad performance.\u000a\u000a* **Envii Fitt** - this was pretty nice. Good variety of flavors, though the pods did leak some. Might try it again with refillable pods.\u000a\u000a* **Juul** - I used Juul for a year and a half but their QC is garbage, they seem to have changed the flavors some, and the popularity with high school kids means pods can be hard to find.\u000a\u000a* **Innokin Pocketmod** - So far this is my favorite of the bunch. Solid build, bulkier than the others but the 1.2ohm coils work well with nic salts. Will buy another.\u000a\u000a\u000aI also want to try the Fuchai v3, Warlock Peas, and Kimsun Slim 2R.

aVNicotine juice for Suorin Air?\u000a\u000aSo, I was a smoker before and recently switched to vaping about a five months ago. I start off with the iJust2, went to the Smok Stick v8, to the Alien... recently found out about the pod devices. I\u2019m all the way down to 6mg nicotine now and about to go down to three. I wanna try one of those pod devices, but I don\u2019t wanna use an insane amount of nicotine since I\u2019m just going down nicotine levels now. But a device like the Suorin Air looks super convient and just what I would want. I\u2019m not sure what juice I\u2019d get because Since the device is less powerful than a smok Stick, I would wanna get a higher nicotine? Anyone have any juice and nicotine suggestions? Really stuck here. Just want a juice that feels like a 3-6mg when it\u2019s in a pen style vape, but I want the juice in the Air device. Any feedback is appreciated, thank you
p146
aVwww.saltnic.com has great salt juice, the 25mg is perfect for the Suorin Air. They actually have package deals, and are having a sale. Just bought my wife 2 more bottles of their Luscious juice, it's pretty tasty. Mango is even better but I think they're sold out. Also there is normally a Reddit20 code for 20% off but they disable it during sales.
p147
aVI use Naked 100 salts, they work great. I use 3mg nic in a regular device (Super Tank Mini at around 40w) and 35mg nic salt in the Suorin Air or other pod devices.

aVNew Suorin Drop color \U0001f308\u000a\u000a[deleted]
p149
aVhttps://imgur.com/I0FfRqx - This week's vape. \u000a\u000aInstalled Arctic Fox on the Invoke, still didn't perform well. It went back into the box. It's a shame, since I do like the form factor of the device. \u000a\u000aThe Suorin Drop works great for my out about sneak-a-vape device. I have Naked 100 Really Berry Salt 35mg loaded in it. No problems with it so far (no leaking, no burnt hits, works as intended); QC lottery on the pod, I guess. I do compulsively clean the area where the contacts are, and the airflow path from condensation when I refill it. I refill it whenever I get home (nowhere close to empty), though, it's a bit of a pain to refill with glass dropper.
p150
aVEvery time I hit my sourin air my mouth produces so much saliva, I have to spit every time. My friend said this happens to her as well, does anyone know why? (I\u2019m wondering if it has anything to do w the fact that my juice has nicotine salts)\u000a\u000a
p151
aVQuestion about vapes and suorins\u000a\u000aOk so I\u2019m new to all this vape stuff and I want to know if a suorin drop is good for blowing clouds and making Os or is there a better vape out there for under 50$. (or a little higher) 
p152
aVWhich beginner pocket pen to choose?\u000a\u000aHello. I want to buy a small compact pen that would be stealth in my pocket. I dont need more than 10mg of nicotine (super light cigs alternative) and the prefilled pod ones dont carry to much of low nicotine. I would prefer to have changable pods so I could switch flavors buts its not a must. It would be nice if it would give big clouds and would be solid enough to not do any dripping in my pocket. Ive read lots of reviews and I am considering these:\u000a\u000a- Aspire Breeze, its little bulky, the liquid fill system is not great, no replacable pods\u000a\u000a- Suorin Air, I like that its so thin but Im not sure if its comfortable to use, the battery is not too big\u000a\u000a- Suorin Drop, i like how it looks little better than Air\u000a\u000a- iCare 2, I dont think there is anything to complain about here, they fixed the driping issues\u000a\u000a- iCare Solo, I like the design for me, its similar to Juul, dont know too much about this, there isnt many comparison\u000a\u000a- Boulder Rock, I like the design as well but there is not many reviews regarding it, people are saying that its a refillable version of Juul(?), Its very inexpensive\u000a\u000a- Rofvape Warlock Peas, dont know to much about it, looks good, draw to fire which I like\u000a\u000aWhich would you recommend? \u000a\u000aAlso what liquid should I get? Mr Salty gets the best reviews but they do not offer low nicotine lvl liquids. Is it worth getting salt nic with low nicotine lvls? What would you suggest?
p153
aVNone of the pod system is going to give clouds. I'm getting along with the Suorin Drop great, there are many complaints about the Suorin Air/Drop in this sub though.\u000a\u000aPremixed nic salt will come in high concentration of nic 25-50mg. There's DIY mixer that will do custom nic salt concentration in r/DIY_classifieds.
p154
aVA lot of Suorin hate on this sub. I only have 2 weeks experience with my Drop. Longevity is far from being tested yet. Could be a case of playing the QC lottery with these pod mods.\u000a\u000aFor what it's worth, the Drop works great so far for me, although I didn't have much expectation for it to begin with.
p155
aVI ordered Suorin Air with regular Naked 100 liquids 3mg Lava Burst and 6mg Hawaiian POG. Will see how it works :P I hope I made a good choice. I am also considering to buy the Rofvape Warlock Peas
p156
aVThis. I have a 45 mg juice in my Suorin and you'll definitely feel that buzz or rush after a couple hits.
p157
aVDrop problems\u000a\u000aIt seems like no matter what I do, I keep getting dry/burnt hits with  the suorin drop.  Like, repeatedly.  I can't hit this thing more than 4-5 times without experiencing it.  It seems to me like a wicking problem.  The bubbles that should be coming out of the wicks just get stuck and don't filtrate out.  They do if you suck harder, but that leads to juice getting in your mouth.  You can also take the pod out and undo the rubber things that you fill it up with, but I'm literally doing that twenty times a day.  I thought this device would be more efficient.  I've tried reaching into the pod through the fill holes with kanthal to poke the cotton and make it more airy, and it helps for a bit, but at a certain point goes right back to giving me burn hits.  I'm pretty much at a loss.  Kind of pissed that I keep have to dicking around with it just to get it to work for a short period of time.
p158
aVYes, and you have the real problem of it not working, just like all those other users.\u000a\u000aFace it, the Suorin is made to be thrown away.
p159
aVSo i ordered a sampler pack from B-X vapors and the guy hooked it up and upgraded my order all from 10ml to 15ml ! Ok so now I have over 200ml of juice on hand, but with my suorin I'm only vaping 1-2ml per day. How should i store all of this juice to make sure it doesn't go bad? Is room temp in a closet alright or should i put them in the fridge? Also should I leave them all sealed? Some people are saying when they steep the juice they crack the seal and then age them. TIA
p160
aVAs far as I know, nope.\u000a\u000aA pod system really sounds like your best bet. Like the Breeze or Sourin Air. The issue is that pod systems came about from JUUL's being so expensive and non-refillable, so any pod system you will have to fill just like any atomizer.
p161
aVOkay so I am left with 4 vapes to choose from:\u000a\u000a- Aspire Breeze, its little bulky, the liquid fill system is not great, no replacable pods\u000a\u000a- Suorin Air, I like that its so thin but Im not sure if its comfortable to use, the battery is not too big\u000a\u000a- iCare 2, I dont think there is anything to complain about here, they fixed the driping issues\u000a\u000a- iCare Solo, its the best design for me, i like the Juul-like style, dont know too much about this, there isnt many comparison\u000a\u000aWhich would you recommend? 
p162
aVsourin air (drop)\u000a\u000aI just bought a new sourin air today and I switched to the drop. I am not sure if I am doing something wrong or if my sourin is fucked because I have not gotten to use it once. It won't flash or anything when i try to hit it and no light comes on when it is charging either. Is there any solution to my problem?
p163
aVI can't tell if I can't understand what you're asking because a) you're not making much sense or b) I'm drinking. The sentence "I just bought a new sourin air today and I switched to the drop" seems contradictory, they're two different devices. Which one are you having trouble with?\u000a\u000aRegardless, there's been a spate of posts about both of them not working well, so the answer may jsut be "buy a new thing"
p164
aVIt all boils down to what you're looking for, I use them both daily. The Air seems to have a tighter draw, but is prone to dry hit. I'd recommend thinner juice, smaller hits and/or space out the hits to allow it to wick. The Drop seems to have a slightly looser draw, wicks better, with rarely a dry hit. The Drop goes through juice slightly faster and you have to open the pod frequently to equalize the dual chamber (seems to vapor lock). The Drop has also given me problems with not hitting at all until I remove/reinstall the pod. I do like the Suorin fleet for the tiny form factor, but I have ordered the Siegeli Compak OB One (updated version of the Compak M). Same size pod as the Suorins with longer battery life. I didn't get any input from this sub, but I still took a chance on a Christmas sale...
p165
aVI've had my suorin air 2 for about 6 weeks with absolutely 0 problems. I also personally know about 5 other people at my school who are using the air 2 without problems. I know it gets a lot of heat around here but as someone who has no interest in big mods or customizing anything this thing has been amazing. I usually switch pods every 15-20ml of juice (im using the solace nic salt 30mg rn but am going to try out normal juice at 18mg soon) and have never had problems burning out pods or had any leaks. Its less than $30 for the kit and about $3-$4 for the refillable pods which is much cheaper than your juul. Looks cool too
p166
aVSourin Air micro USB problem\u000a\u000aI have had my Suorin Air for a few weeks and it has been great! However, today I plugged it in and it is not charging ( I know this because the blue light doesn't come on when the cable is plugged in ) can somebody help me fix this?
p167
aVThrow it away and buy another one (or another device altogether). The Suorin isn't known for quality. I say this as a mostly happy owner of one, but it looks like I got lucky? 
p168
aVI have had my Sourin Air for a couple of weeks and it has been great! The only problem I have had is some minor leaking, so I just opened it up and cleaned the inside. However, today it stopped taking a charge (the blue light does not turn on when I plug the cable in) can someone help me fix this?\u000a\u000a[deleted]
p169
aVthanks for doing what you do, man. without your contributions to the sub, we'd be half suorin questions and half alien questions.
p170
aVCheapest place to buy Suorin Air pods that ships to Asia? Also a question about it.\u000a\u000aQuestion being, i've used mine for a week and finally had the pod to 10% of ejuice left. Went on to refill it and it just tastes burnt. Are there any tips or guidelines I should follow to prevent this from happening again? I was informed it should take atleast 3 refills before changing the pod. Chain vaping too much? Or anything that might cause this? I'm using 50/50 juice from a DIY vendor at the moment with 36mg salt.\u000a\u000aI've read about Suorin Air problems around here and i've seen people even compare it to Smok as it usually has problems, but when it works, it blows off competition. I'm gonna give it another go and try to work around it and fix it as people said, I totally agree, win this thing works it's just one of the best you could have. I won't even mind if I manage to make a pod last for only for 2 weeks or 2 refills.\u000a\u000aThanks!

aVSuorin drop lights\u000a\u000aOnly one of the lights work on my drop even when it\u2019s charging. Anyone know the problem/solution?
p172
aVJust bought a brand new Suorin Air(just got it today),keep in mind it was my first time vaping/smoking anything, But The device makes a crackling noise as i hit it and one time i turned it on and the blue light automatically lit up and started to make the crackling noise,What does this mean?\u000a\u000a
p173
aVAlright..i appreciate you commenting..what should i do with the suorin? 
p174
aVive been looking up things on youtube and it tells me to clean it by popping out the interior of the suorin..but i dont wanna fuck up my device..so im not sure if i should continue 
p175
aVI opened up the cartridge..cleaned it..then i put it back together and let the suorin run for a bit..after that it worked just fine..and the crackling noises are happening because i currently have no nicotine in my juice. 
p176
aVSourin Air - easy fix\u000a\u000aDid some googling around and found that a lot of people run into this problem where the device stops responding to hits, but still lights up when charging. I just fixed mine and it was really easy, so I wanted to let people here know in case anyone else has this device and is annoyed that it stopped working.\u000a\u000a1) Turn it off.\u000a\u000a2) Pull the cartridge out and set it aside. \u000a\u000a3) Use something soft, like a plastic or wooden rod, to slowly push the inner electronic piece out of the shell. The entire thing will plop right out. \u000a\u000a4) Carefully pull off the rubber piece that covers the battery. Remember its orientation so that you can put it back on, then set it aside. \u000a\u000a5) Now you're holding the naked innards of this thing. If it's goopy then you're in luck -- getting rid of all of the goop will potentially solve your dead device. \u000a\u000a6) Use a cloth or tissue that does not leave behind a bunch of fibers to wipe off all the gunk. \u000a\u000a7) Let this inner electronic part dry for a while. \u000a\u000a8) Put the rubber piece back over the battery, then slide the entire thing back up into the shell. Put the cartridge back in and test it out.\u000a\u000aWhen I did this I had to repeat it a couple times before it was working again. I think I missed a few blobs of oil the first time so I had to go back and really make sure everything was clean and dry before it started working again.\u000a\u000a\u000aSo there it is. Quick, painless, and no tools required other than your fingers and something skinny like the back of a plastic spoon (or metal if you're careful not to scratch anything) to push out the electronics.

aVDon't vape oils. It'll give you pneumonia and possibly kill you.\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aYou might like a pod system. They're about the size of 2-6 cigarettes tied together. Some of them have a button you press that starts them and some just autostart when you begin sucking on the mouthpiece.\u000a\u000aJuuls aren't refillable, but they're popular. You just have to keep buying their pods with their juice in it.\u000a\u000aDon't buy Suorin products; lots of people have issues with them.. probably stay away from Eleaf iCares, too.\u000a\u000aAspire Breeze seems decent, it fires when you draw on it.. Atopack Dolphins seem OK, they have a button that fires them and they can fit a lot of liquid.\u000a\u000aThere are a lot of other pod systems that I'm not aware of. Maybe try watching some YouTube reviews. (Just remember that most reviewers aren't reviewers.. they're salesmen disguised as reviewers. Some are trustworthy, but those guys are few and far between.)\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aIf you really want something the size of a cigarette, you might just go to a gas station and pick up a cigalike. They're honestly crap.. with tiny batteries and not much juice in them, but if you're just an occasional smoker the low entry price might be up your alley. I know I quit smoking using MarkTens from the coupons they sent me through the mail. (Regularly they're ~$10 for one battery and one cartomizer, then ~$10 for two cartomizers. One cart would last me about a day.) I found out you can remove the back of the cartomizers and fill them up with your own eliquid, provided you have a small syringe to get it in there. (Once I did that for a few weeks and decided that I liked vaping, I gave those away to another smoker and bought myself real vape gear.)

aVIm looking to buy my first full size MTL mod to use at home while I bring my suorin around when on the go. Do you think this would work well for a beginner? I'd like to not have to deal with a complicated device aside from changing coils every once in a while. Im more concerned about flavor than clouds in the mod i get
p179
aVI didn't enjoy the coils TBH, when they worked they worked well but that was limited to a day or two for me.  I'm sure my vaping style has something to do with that but how much I can't honestly say.  If you're not a heathen like me and rip them I think you'll have more success. What I can tell you is the Nautilus 2 was more reliable but the flavor was far better in the Amor NS.  The box itself wasnt bad, in a bind it made for a great bottle opener too.\u000a\u000aEDIT: I'm using a Suorin Drop now and a Smok  Infinix.  The Drop hasn't been a problem at all, I get a few fills on the pods and no catastrophic incidents.  The Infinix is a sample, it's Smok's answer to the Phix. I have been vaping CRFT salts lately, their mint is a spearmint and that just tickles me.

aVHistory of Issues with Suorin Air\u000a\u000aHey Guys, I just wanted to post a write up of my issues with the Suorin Air. When this device is working I absolutely love it. It's super stealthy and satisfies with 50mg/ml nic salt. However the issues I've had have me looking for other subcompacts. I love my multi 18650 mods, RDA's and squonking but this device hits a great niche. Here's hoping they come out with more revisions solving issues.\u000a\u000aHistory of Issues:\u000a\u000aFirst Suorin Air Gold: Blinking light 1 out of 10 puffs, then developed to only 1 out of 5 puffs working. Auto switch stopped working, this could be fixed by blowing up from the bottom hard.\u000a\u000aSecond Suorin Air Black: On/Off button stopped working and LED showed charging status at all times. Then after overnight charging battery vented. Swapped battery from gold to black. Also getting hits that continue 1-2 sec after finished drawing.\u000a\u000aYou can open the Suorin by removing the pod inserting the smaller end to push the electronics out of the body, this is totally non-destructive and the unit can be re-assembled.\u000a\u000aAfter taking the unit apart a number of times I collected the markings on various parts.\u000aMicrocontroller Marking: S033 PHVG 709Y\u000aLikely: STM8S003F3 Also seen on Board\u000aTL431 voltage reference\u000aX1YV power switch\u000aMosfet 702\u000aLTC4054 Li-ion Battery Charger \u000a\u000a[Also noticed possibly a new version listed on cigabuy. This one seems to have an adjustable slider on the bottom?]\u000a(http://www.cigabuy.com/authentic-suorin-air-card-style-aio-starter-kit-silver-p-11590.html)
p181
aVHow long did each of your Suorins last you before these issues came up? I personally think a lot of it has to do with the style of vaping this encourages - small stealth setups that go in and out of pockets a lot. This causes a lot of dirt and debris to get into the little crevices in a device where you don't really want that stuff. Not to mention it's probably constantly getting jostled around, tossed places, and banged up against keys and phones and whatever else. \u000a\u000aIt really is a tiny, great device when it works well. My wife's has been working well for a good month or 2 now though, only problems so far have been with one pod that died after only refilling it a couple times, the cotton somehow exploded out into the reservoir. But it's awesome for the price point especially, in my opinion. Much better than an iCare 2.
p182
aVI dropped my suorin in water and its probably toasted. I want to take the body apart to try and salvage it. You just push the internals out with the small side of the pod?\u000a\u000aMy suorin was leaking juice through the bottom before this, so I was considering a new one anyway. Have you any experience we with the suorin drop?\u000a\u000a

aVConstant and loud crackling from suorin air.\u000a\u000aI just got my suorin air a few days ago, and it is by far the best stealth vape I\u2019ve bought. It blows every other one on the mainstream market that I\u2019ve tried out of the water in my opinion (JUUL, PHIX, Vuse Vibe, Vuse solo *shudders* , Rubi, Eleaf). The only issue that I have is the constant and almost violent crackling that it produces every time I draw from it. Now I\u2019ve had clearomizers and all of the devices mentioned above, and I haven\u2019t had anything close to this kind of crackling. The worst part is that with the crackle, it produces a blast of hot air (sort of like a mini dry hit) that burns my throat. Could this be attributed to wicking problems, or something else?
p186
aVI have found it takes 10 minutes for the wick in the Sourin air to soak up the Eliquid and it goes through the soak fast. I always have to be patient with it. If it continues I would just get a new cartridge.

aVSourin Air Tasting Burnt For No Apparent Reason\u000a\u000aJust got my new Sourin Air in the mail today, using Mr Salt-E juice (45 mg). I also bought 3 spare pods. I filled each of them up, let them prime for 1 hour each. At first everything was OK; flavor was meh, but for $25 it aint bad. However, after about 20 minutes of medium usage they already started tasting incredibly burnt. This was happening on ALL the pods. I let them sit again for another hour, and the same thing happened. They taste fine at first, then start to taste burnt. I looked at the cotton/wick (not sure which it uses) through the translucent pod, and they're white as can be. This is incredibly frustrating, because I have no clue what is going on. Anybody have any insight, or a solution for this issue?
p189
aVSearch sourin air. You will find sooo many posts just like this. Good luck.

aVHow long does nicotine/cotinine stay in your system?\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve looked through the search bar but I haven\u2019t seen any questions about a very small amount of nicotine. I stopped vaping on about Dec 1st, and I had been vaping 3mg juice before, consuming about 1.5 ml a day for about two weeks (my vape broke and I got a new one right before thanksgiving). On Dec 9th I took two draws from my friends Suorin which had 5mg juice in it. If I have a health insurance physical on Dec 19th in which they test for nicotine (probably either cheek swab or urine test), would I test positive for nicotine or cotinine? I feel like I should be okay but I just want to make sure. Any advice is appreciated, thanks!
p191
aVYeah I second u/lestermagneto 's suggestion that the wiki has a wealth of information, definitely a good guide! \u000a\u000aIf that's overwhelming though, I'd personally recommend getting a small mouth-to-lung kit with some 25-50mg nicotine salts. You can see if Mt. Baker Vapor still has the free Joyetech AIO (all-in-one) kit for free with code FLAVORNOW. Or another great device is the Suorin Air, I believe www.saltnic.com still has a $30 deal for the device and a 30ml bottle of their nicotine salts juice, and you can use code Reddit20 for 20% off.\u000a\u000aAlso, while I personally don't shop at Brick &amp; Mortar ("B&amp;M" or, "that vape shop down the street") stores due to higher pricing, they can be a very valuable resource for those looking to make the switch.

aVNic salt juice for suorin from myvapestore\u000a\u000aHi all, first time poster here. I\u2019ve gotten the Mr. Salt-e grappleberry and the NKD lava flow salt juice and both tasted pretty burnt (even on a new pod). I wanna know what other juices for the suorin people have tried from myvapestore and their top picks.

aVSuorin burnt cotton\u000a\u000aSo I recently got a new Suorin Air cart, and I filled it with juice and let it sit for about 15 minutes. Now I've refilled it about 4 times and it tastes and hits fine, no burning taste or smell, HOWEVER, the cotton on the side of the mouthpiece is toasted black. It doesn't touch the juice so I don't know how I would have even prevented it from burning, but is it time for a new cart even though it still hits and tastes fine? I'm not tryna breathe in tons of burnt cotton ya know?
p195
aVVery good note. Wasn't a fan of my pulse, refilled my phix once in a while but now my Suorin Air is acting up. Thinking maybe to get a mipod
p196
aVMiPod is definitely solid.  The Suorin Drop is pretty awesome so far as well, but I've heard mixed things on their durability.  I just keep going back to my iCare when I want a tiny high nic vape haha.  
p197
aVDrop vs air pod quality?\u000a\u000aIs a suorin drop better than an air for pod quality? Like how an air gets burnt really easily and you have to prime it and such. Is a drop better on that in that it doesn't get burnt as easy?
p198
aVIf you just want a small setup for work and like MTL.. and you've been gone from the vaping scene for two years.. you may be interested in nicotine salt liquids.\u000a\u000aNicotine salt isn't salt; it's a different form of nicotine that's used in vape juice. It enters the body more quickly, so people can get a buzz like with a cigarette.\u000a\u000aWhen people use salt based juice, they usually don't go for 3/6/12mg strengths.. they go for 24/36/48mg strengths and only MTL it. There are new devices called pod systems with 2ml-6ml pods that you can refill (on most of them.) The pods easily fit into your pocket, so people take them on vacation and to work.. and they're a discreet MTL device, so you're not chucking clouds and drawing attention on your vape breaks.. and the high nicotine content means just a few drags is all you need to catch a nicotine buzz and get back to work.\u000a\u000aJuul makes the most popular one, but I think its pods aren't refillable. Stay away from Suorin products (Smok/Eleaf tier quality control, apparently.) Also, I've heard a few bad things about Eleaf's iCare 2.\u000a\u000aI think the better ones are Aspire Breeze / Atopack Dolphin (not Penguin, the Dolphin can MTL, the Penguin can't.) Sigelei and a few other manufacturers are getting into the market, too. Here's the first site I can think of that has a Pod section of devices they sell: http://www.myvaporstore.com/Pod-Systems-Ecig-Starter-Kits-s/525.htm\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aOh, and the nicotine salt juice.. (remember, it's not salty, it refers to the chemical form of the nicotine.)\u000a\u000aHere's a thread where they discuss some vendors and list another thread where other vendors of nicotine salt juices are listed: https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/7i6fww/alternative_nic_salt_companies

aVSourin Air pods\u000a\u000aMy friend found a Sourin about 2 months ago and we started refilling about 3 weeks ago and I'm wondering if I need a new pod. I'm guessing I've refilled it about 8-9 times and I am not having an issue with burning or taste, although it is leaky. I'm really not sure how many times whoever owned it prior filled it up but there's still a lot of cotton. Is there a serious downside to not buying a new pod/ when should I get a new one?
p203
aVWord. Ain't no point in posting about Suorins to teenagers unless you selling em to em.
p204
aVNo worries mate - do me a favor and don't delete posts tho? Fair enough if it's the millionth post that day about I'm 14 and my Suorin is broken, but this one might have been useful for someone else on the basis that anyone ever uses the searchb...yeah I'll stop now.
p205
aVThere's been a lot of advice here and I hope you don't read this too late, but I think the Suorin Air and some nic salt juice would be ideal in this situation.  \u000a\u000aThe Air is a pod based system, each pod lasts about five refills and each fill should get him a few days of use.  The pods are about 4 bucks each. They're virtually fool proof, you literally just put juice in it and snap the pod in place.  No changing coils, no adjusting wattage, no buttons and a charge lasts a decent amount of time, and they don't take long to charge. \u000a\u000aNic Salt juice is going to be better for him than regular nic juice.  Considering his heavy smoking habit, you'll need a higher nic content to really satisfy the craving.  I would get him some 50mg juice from Solace or Salty Man.  Both of them have decent tobacco flavors, Solace's juice comes in 15 ml bottles for like 8 bucks or so, so you can try a few different flavors.  \u000a\u000aThe air has a very high resistance on the coil, so he won't be blowing through juice, the little bottles will last a lot longer than with a more traditional set up.  \u000a\u000a
p206
aVSuorin Air keeps ripping\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve had my suorin air for about a month now and I\u2019ve only gone through one pod, and there were absolutely no problems while on that first pod. About half way into this next pod the suorin has had a problem of continual ripping. When I take a hit, it still rips even after I stop hitting it, and the only way to stop it is by turning it off. It burns the coil super fast, and I basically wasted my pod. I got another one, and this issue continued, and I don\u2019t want to burn this one either, so I\u2019m letting it sit until I find the solution. Ive tried some obvious solutions, like recharging it, taking the pod out, letting it sit, and I can\u2019t seem to find the answer to my problem. Has anyone had this problem and if so is there a solution?
p207
aVThere's like 7 threads a day regarding this issue with the Suorin. Do a quick search to see if anyone has a fix.
p208
aVYep. Easy solution. You need to increase the airflow to the pod.  Search on you tube for a video called Suorin Air airflow hack with a guy in Hawaii. Basically there is a tiny metal clip between the 2 contact posts on the pod. Remove the clip from every new pod with your fingernail or a jewelers flathead. Problem solved.
p209
aVIt just hit me that you're talking about the iCare and I was talking about the iJust. Derp.. I'm not fully awake, at the moment.. and I'm sitting down, taking breaks from Photoshop and photographing old Masonic hats I'm trying to get on eBay before 8pm EST.\u000a\u000aSorry.. My experience was the same with the *iJust 2*.\u000a\u000aI think Eleaf just makes terri-bad coils.. and stores will never refund anything that's been used. I'd just suggest you save up for another device and learn to distrust Eleaf.\u000a\u000aThe Aspire Breeze / Atopack Dolphin are things I don't hear too many complaints about. Maybe look into one of those. Juuls have non-refillable pods and avoid anything from Suorin like it has leprosy. 
p210
aVIf you want a pod system like a Juul, Aspire Breeze or an iCare 2, go with nicotine salts. 24 / 36 or 48mg strength.\u000a\u000aI think Juuls aren't refillable, though.. so you might be happier with one of the other pod systems. \u000a\u000aOh, and stay far away from Suorin Air or Drop. We get more people coming here having problems with Suorin pods than any other pod.\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aThis link has some companies that sell nic salt juice: https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/7i6fww/alternative_nic_salt_companies In the comments of that post is also another post that has a few more listed.

p215
aVWhat, every time little Timmy posts a Suorin thread, you guys just do whatever the fuck you want?\u000a\u000aOk then. Carry on. 
p216
aVWell, you can start with a pen device that has a 510 connector, so you could get other tanks to use on it and keep diffferent flavors in them. The Innokin Endura T18 and T20 are fairly popular. I wouldn't recommend an iJust because it's only for direct lung inhaling (that's hitting it like a bong.)\u000a\u000aYou can also go with pod systems. You can't use other tanks with them, but they tend to be smaller and easier to fit into your pocket. Juul / Aspire Breeze / iCare 2 / Atopack Dolpin seem to be decent and fairly popular. I'd stay away from Suorin Airs and Drops, as they appear to have quality control issues. We see a lot of new vapers come here because their Suorin pods unexpectedly died.\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aNicotine salt juices also might help a new vaper transition from smoking.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/7i6fww/alternative_nic_salt_companies\u000a\u000aNicotine salts are absorbed into the body more quickly than regular vaping nicotine. You can get your morning nicotine buzz using salt based devices. If you go with a mouth to lung pod system, a lot of people run those with nicotine salts in high concentrations. I think 24 / 36 / 48 are the normal amounts of nicotine used in them.

I'd like your input on what's it like having it, pros and cons and stuff. or if anything help me decide on what's a good pod device that I can hit when I'm out and about or when I don't wanna chuck fat clouds. \u000aAlso what's some good salt nic ejuice ? 
p218
aVI don't know a whole load about them but given they're all fairly cheap I wouldn't be expecting the build quality on any of them to be great. The Suorin does seem to be a clunker based on post volume tho. If I was gonna go for one it'd probably be the Boulder Rock deal at Bombies - you get a 30ml bottle with that for $25
p219
aVOutside of the refill option (outside of opening and filling a used juul pod) what do you like better about it? I've had a juul for about the same time span as you have had the sourin, but the only con I can find is how expensive pods can be  (I've yet to try to refill any since I have a 2 half used ones and 2 full ones, and 8 coming). \u000a\u000aI was looking for a refillable option and the sourin is up on my list, but the size and shape of it made me look at a few others. \u000a\u000aI'm curious though as to what you found made you prefer it than the Juul, because it may be things I never considered or understimated. 
p220
aVPersonally I get much better hits off my drop. I have to take the stupid pods out of my Juul every 4 hits and shake the bubbles out. My only issue currently is finding Salt Nic juice that\u2019s good. It\u2019s expensive and there\u2019s so few choices/reviews. Solace strawberry hard candy is really good though. If you buy from [vapordna](https://www.vapordna.com/Holiday-Promotion-Suorin-Drop-and-Solace-Bundle-p/hpsula.htm) they have a holiday bundle where if you spend $25 or more you can get the Suorin Drop and the choice of either Solace Strawberry Hard Candy or Solace Mint for $19.99 using coupon code "DROP". That sounds weird but I copied and pasted that last bit from their website cause I\u2019m lazy but it\u2019s how I got mine plus some juice to try. 
p221
aVEnded up ordering the Suorin Drop bundle with my Element Vape GC. Got the Really Berry and Frost Bite nic salts in 35mg to go with the Drop. After that I figured I'd need pods, just in case, and ordered 8 pods + $20 Drop promo from VaporDNA.\u000a\u000aTotal came out to $106 (-$50 GC) for 2x Drop, 2x 30ml Naked Salt, 1x 15ml Solace salt, and 8 replacement pods. Not too bad, imho, but yeah, here's hoping they don't suck. 
p222
aVYou actually ordered a Suorin product as an ECR regular, after seeing post after post after post of issues? I envy your glass half full approach.\u000a\u000aI got a Roflvape peas a bit ago and have some 18mg salts in it, it works fairly well, but has absolutely 0 flavor. I have 2 flavors with 18mg salts currently, a grape from Mr. Hash, and a bottle of 0mg pinky I added 100mg salts base to, to make it 18mg. It has so little flavor, I can't tell which juice I am vaping.

aVSuorin Air Problems\u000a\u000aI recently got a Suorin Air V2, and was extremely impressed with it across the board (besides battery life). After a week of using it (on the first fill up) it began to have some problems. They battery is constantly red and never goes off (even when the device is powered off). I pushed the battery out of the case and cleaned off all the components (thinking juice might have leaked), however there was no juice, and everything seemed to be on working order. The light has yet to turn off, and has been negatively effecting my battery life. It was still hitting fine, so I didn't think anything of it. But now the device flashes red and barely hits. I was thinking it may be a battery issue. If so, should I write Suorin about the issue?

I then ordered the eGo AIO RBA from fasttech, as I've become used to never buying coils over the years. This RBA should also work in the Mi One AIO, but I'm wondering if there are other tiny MTL kits that have RBA options? I really like the size of the iCare 2, Aspire Breeze, etc, but those are all prebuilt coils only right (the iCare 2 coils are very cheap though - considering picking one of those up)? Am I missing any tiny, low power, high nic devices with RBA options?\u000a\u000aSide note - how does the eGo AIO compare to the other smaller AIO kits like the iCare2, Suorin Air, Breeze, etc?

I think it\u2019s just a design flaw.  \u000a\u000aI\u2019m still on my first Suorin Pod purchased on Black Friday and I think it\u2019s just the nature of these types of Pods.  Even the myjet had wick density issue, most were over stuffed with cotton.\u000a\u000aBut the experience has been pretty solid.  I\u2019ve been using Juul and Bo.  Between the two I\u2019ve found the Bo to be very consistent, but it got expensive.

aVThat's a wide range of flavors.. and you have a menthol tobacco. I smoked M Menthol for 20 years, so when I try a new vendor's juice I always go for the menthol, first.. although none of the ones I've tried ever seem to have enough menthol, even when billed as a strong menthol.\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aIf you're trying to increase your visibility, you might consider adding yourself to the Xmas/NewYear sale megathread.. along with a sale.  https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/7i7oc8/vendorsplease_submit_your_christmasnew_years_sale\u000a\u000aA giveaway here and there will also help people to realize that you exist.\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aYou should really spend a few hours adding yourself to the Juice DB: https://www.juicedb.com That's where a lot of people go to shop for juice by reading reviews and looking at their sales page. It's tedious work, but it's one of the things that differentiates large scale vendors from mom &amp; pop shops.\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aAlso, salt nicotine popularity is on the rise. People like high nicotine content salt liquids to use in pocket kits like iCares / Juuls / Aspire Breezes / Suorin "poor QC" Drops. They're mostly for a few short pulls while at work or on the go, when you don't want to rip clouds but still need a nicotine fix. Crafting a handful of salt liquids will put you on some people's radar that wouldn't otherwise bother with you.\u000a\u000a

aVAlternative Nic Salt Companies?\u000a\u000aHey dudes, I have purchased a suorin drop recently.  I tried the Mr. Salt-E in it first, and I got pretty bad flavor, and I very recently (the past two to three weeks) tried naked 100's nic salt line, but it keeps spitting into my mouth, and truth be told I don't really want that high of a nic content juice just getting in my mouth.  I've been told it's 50/50 vg pg.  I was just wondering if anyone had any other suggestions for companies they've tried that are really good?  Thanks ahead of time.  
p241
aVwww.saltnic.com - the Tropical Mango is seriously delicious, even compared to "regular" juice. Also the Luscious (from the VGOD line) is tasty, but those are the only 2 I've tried from their line. It comes in 50mg or 25mg, and my wife uses the 25mg daily.\u000a\u000aThey actually have a good deal for starter combo, if they have them in stock the Suorin Air + 30ml bottle is $30, but they also have a Reddit20 code for 20% off. The owner is decently active here on r/ecr and is a really nice guy, I recommend their juice pretty much anytime I can!

aVHi there! I use a Suorin Drop, and I see a lot of the nicotine salt e-liquid that is advertised for use with it in 30mg, 45mg, and 50mg quantities, while traditional e-liquid I understand is in quantities of 1.5/3mg(s). \u000a\u000aI checked out your website and the flavors are interesting! I'm still looking for a lot of info on nicotine salts, etc. and I was wondering if you could tell me more...I am not sure if your products are the ones I am looking for!
p243
aVI've been using the Suorin Drop but I'm awaiting a shipment of the Kimsun Slim 2r (which I heard is temperature controlled), and the Atopack Dolphin (I'm hoping I get a better MTL hit with this one and less burnt pods, we'll see...)
p244
aVAny suggestions for a "stealth setup" AIO? Something along the lines of an Aspire Breeze or Suorin Air. Best bang for your buck?
p245
aVDon't know much about either but this week's count of 'my Suorin is doing lol something I don't know halp lol' to 'I'm having issues with my Breeze' posts is about 5000:1 so I'd go with the Aspire based on nothing other than that.

aVthey use suorin air pods.. 
p248
aVYou don't replace the coil, you just buy a whole new pod. Google "suorin air pods" and they come up.

aV[Review] Suorin Drop\u000a\u000aNever really one to do reviews since I generally pick up products that others have extensively reviewed. But my vape died when I was out, so I stopped by a local B&amp;M and picked up the Drop. Here's a review! \u000a\u000a**Craftsmanship**\u000a\u000aSolid. I have the black version which has a reflective surface, so it does pick up fingerprints. But the build itself is damn near perfect. The two sides dont have any noticeable alignment issues unless youre looking for the seams with your fingernail. There will be a noticeable seam between the metal battery housing and the plastic pod, but aesthetically its as small as it gets. There are two screws at the bottom which are snug and flush. Its not a very big device - about 2.5 inches long and 1.5 inch at its widest - but it has a decent weight to it. \u000a\u000aNo rattles or anything when shaken. The pod doesnt rattle if you shake the battery, and the battery doesnt rattle when you shake the pod. The pods fit snugly into the device. If youre a hands-free type of vapor, you can clamp your lips on the mouthpiece and the bottom half of the device wont come close to falling off. Though the shape of the device isnt really meant for a hands-free vape. \u000a\u000a**Comfort**\u000a\u000aI have medium-size hands. 9.5 inches from the bottom of my palm to the top of my middle finger. I have no issues holding this device, nor does it feel awkward. If youre worried about it slipping, there is a little rubber "bump" (for lack of a better world) with the Suorin logo in it on the front that helps prevent that. I havent had any issues with dropping the device.\u000a\u000aThe slim body and having no sharp edges is a plus if you like keeping your vape in your slightly-too-tight jeans pockets. \u000a\u000a**Vape**\u000a\u000aIts a MTL, ultra portable device and should be treated as such. It has a slightly tighter draw than my iCare Mini - while you can take a lung hit with the iCare mini with a little difficulty, you pretty much cant with the Drop. \u000a\u000aFlavor is decent. Its not anywhere near amazing but is solid for a ultra-portable device. I'd say its a hair better than my iCare. The shop I went to recommended using juices with Nicotine Salts, but as a guy who vapes 6mg on MTL devices and 1.5 in my RDAs I dont find it necessary. \u000a\u000a**The pods**\u000a\u000aIts a refillable pod based system. However, the pods are probably unlike any that youve ever used - there are two "halves" to the tank, but there is some movement of juice between the two halves. There are also two rubber grommets to seal in the juice for each half. I found the easiest way to fill is open both sides up, tilt the pod, and fill one side (and it will flow to the other). If you dont open both sides, there is isnt enough space for air to exit the tank when youre filling it, and it wont fill properly. Youre going to need a syringe or a small-tipped bottle to fill this thing easily. While its possible with a dropper, its a pain in the ass. \u000a\u000aI have been using the device for the past week. The manual recommends changing pods every 5 uses (hah!). But I've gone through about 30 refills with the pod with no huge drop in flavor or vapor. After a refill, you have to wait about 2-3 minutes for the wick to soak. \u000a\u000a**Misc**\u000a\u000aBattery life isnt amazing. Its about 30-45 minutes of chain vaping. But recharging is quick - about 30 minutes through a micro USB. They provide a usb-to-microusb thats white, about a foot-and-a-half long, and has a flat plastic cord. Its a lot nicer than the standard black one every other electronic device comes with, but I dont use it cause its too short.\u000a\u000aThe device can be vaped with pass-through charging, which is always a plus. But I feel like the Drop uses higher power during pass-through charging than when not. I never get dry hits when its not charging, but pass through charging gives me dry hits when I chain vape. \u000a\u000aThe only light indicator about the status of the battery is directly underneath the pod. Its a blue light that turns on whenever you take a hit. The light is supposed to flash or turn red during a draw when youre getting low on battery, but theres no real way to tell unless youre in dark room. You cant see it. But when its charging its good: red = charging, blue = done.\u000a\u000aIt does misfire. Sometimes you hit it and it doesnt fire immediately, but I've never had it continually fire when I'm not hitting it (which IMO is a lot bigger of a problem). I noticed it happen most frequently when you just unplugged the device and its the first draw and when you take a series of small puffs back-to-back.  \u000a\u000aAnd lastly, Suorin really wants to let you know its their device. On this tiny device they managed to put "Suorin" on it 3 times. Its not a dealbreaker for me, but it would look a whole lot more elegant if there were no branding at all.  \u000a\u000aTL;DR I like it. 
p256
aVI am always on the lookout for small devices that pack some punch - good for quick hits at work, between flights, etc.\u000a\u000aI used Juul for a good year and a half but their QC is awful. They seem to have thinned out the liquid and cheaped out on flavors as they have all seemed to change in the last year and the pods burn through much faster, if they work at all.\u000a\u000aI just picked up a Suorin Air and love it so far. I have some nic salt 35mg (NKD 100) arriving today. It has 2ml refillable pods and hits really nicely so far.\u000a\u000aI've also tried the Phix, Envii Fit, and iCare at various times and neither really did the trick. The Phix pods had good flavor but so much spitback I had to blow through the pod to clear juice every so often. The original iCare was just not good and dry hit constantly. The Fit definitely came the closest, but the refillable pods weren't available at the time.
p257
aVSo I just cleaned my Suorin Air from the inside out and when I take a hit it starts to auto fire after I draw. I can take the cartridge out and stop it but I can\u2019t figure out how to get it to stop without removing it. Any suggestions?\u000a\u000a
p258
aV-&gt; r/Suorin
p259
aVI\u2019m liking my Suorin Drop. A semi-loose mouth to lung, really easy to use, pretty fast charging. Looks a little funky (like a water drop) but it\u2019s actually really comfortable to hold and vape. 
p260
aVIf you're worried about cost, get a suorin air or suorin drop. Look up "Pbusardo suorin drop" on YouTube for a good review. If you don't mind spending the money on pods, then get a Juul. The Juul is far and beyond the best pod system, he's just the cost of the pods that's a little over the top.
p261
aVAny pod system you use with pre filled pods will only last you as long as you use it. Fill your own pods are good but the coils in them don't last very long if you chain vape them. Fillables are going to cost more dependent on juice. Pre filled pods are very expensive if you use them a lot because pods run dry. The phix has the largest pods I've used for pre filled. So that's my go to for a pre filled system. The suorin drop is my go to for fill your own. 
p262
aVI'm loving the Suorin Drop. Super stealth, quiet, feels so good in hand and smooth draw, refillable. So far I've filled my first pod 7 or 8 times even though they say 5 times. Pods are pretty cheap too, at 3.99.
p263
aVIf you're looking to get back into the swing of things, start small. I'd suggest something like the Suorin Drop or the iCare 2. If you want something more substantial - the Vaporesso Swag kit is a nice 80w set up.
p264
aVIf you want a small mtl people seem to like the aspire breeze and suorin air, if you want a mod/atty I would highly recommend a pico with a supertank mini or a wasp nano if you want to go the rda route. The pico also comes in a squonk version perfect for the wasp. I have a battlestar with a peerless se on top and I find myself using my pico/wasp way more because of similar reasons to yours.
p265
aVBouncing off the suggestions of /u/pandaontheloose and /u/tentonshogun . It seems like if you're looking for something "not to blast your lungs/esophagus/stomach too hard", a kit like the suorin drop, icare 2, or aspire breeze would be the route to go. If you are set on getting into a mod/tank combo, supertank uses a lot of different coils so I imagine you could find one that would work well with higher nicotine content juices at lower wattages. \u000a\u000a\u000aNow, if you want to get into rebuilding, it depends on the route you want to take. The wasp nano is VERY open on air flow, which really promotes using bigger coils, lower resistances, and higher wattages (though it is single coil). A Hadaly clone may be better suited since I hear that has tighter airflow, that way you could get a good mouth-to-lung setup going. Alternatively, the Berserker is a great MTL tank, though you'd want something like the Pico 25 so that there isn't any overhang from the atomizer. 
p266
aVMy suorin air has a terrible plastic taste!\u000a\u000aI got a new suorin air and every hit has a weird medicine plastic taste.. I\u2019ve tried other pods that are old new and everything in between.. even when I inhale through the air hole with out a pod I can taste it! Any suggestions? 
p267
aVI couldn't disagree more. I've had zero issues with Sourin products.  I LOVE the Air v2 and the Drop isn't bad either. 
p268
aVNot everyone wants to deal with the bullshit of building coils, worrying about batteries, or carrying around a brick of a mod anymore. I've been thru all that shit over the past 4 years and am tired of it. I use a Suorin Air as my primary device and couldn't be happier. 
p269
aVMTL Setups other than MTL devices?\u000a\u000aBesides iCares, Juuls, myJet, Suorin and whatnot, what are other MTL builds that can handle 36mg of salt nic? I've seen single coil RDA setups and some using subohm tanks used in very low wattages. How does flavor compare to the usual devices used for MTL, like the ones listed above?\u000a\u000aI don't really care about the vapor production for this one, just a good throat hit and flavor delivery.

aVJoyetech ATOPACK DOLPHIN review :)\u000a\u000aTechnical stuff:\u000aSize: 100.0mm*50.0mm*31.0mm\u000aWeight: 91.0g\u000aCartridge capacity: 2ml/6ml\u000aBattery capacity: 2100mAh\u000aMax charging current: 2A\u000aColors: black, white, orange, blue, yellow\u000aOutput mode: direct output (Max: 50W)\u000aFeatures: dolphin-like appearance, JVIC system, mouth-to-lung,direct-lung, easy refilling, transparent tank, 2A quick charge\u000a\u000aI have been using the Dolphin for 2 weeks now and loving it got the all black one :) . That is after learning that it don't handle 80% VG that well :P. Almost killed the  JVIC2 0.25ohm coil it comes with. So i had to pick up a 50/50 blend from my locale vape shop. It did have a burned taste at first, but the flavor was intense once it was gone.  After a week i switches to the JVIC3 1.2ohm (MTL) coil to see how i like it. Changing the coil is simple and easy  and there is no mess. The MTL coil is not bad but not my cup of tea. But keeping with a 50/50 blend I got good flavor and draw is not to tight.\u000a The design of the dolphin fits perfectly in your hand the fire button is also placed just right but take some getting used to. But I think that has to do with the fact that I got the all black one. I keep forgetting what side the buttons on lol. It also makes a good stealth Vape :) \u000aThe Pod system isn't too bad either and is different. And has some pros and cons wish I had the Penguin to compare it to or a Suorin drop. \u000aCons: \u000a1. it has started to leak around the edges of the coil don't know if it has to do with the cold wether tho. \u000a2. Using a dropper to fill the pod can be a pain if not done right. The hole is a bit to small so when e liquid gets in the way it traps the air in and e liquid don't go in. \u000a3. Can be hard to see how much is in the pod have to hold up to a light to see how much is in it. \u000aPros: \u000a1. Easy to fill if not using a dropper. \u000a2. Can label what e liquid you use in it. \u000a3. Can also have more than one pod \u000aI really like using the dolphin would make a great starter for some one new to vaping. It's $29.99 on most sites for the kit, $2.99 for pods, $10.99 for 5 pack of coils. I don't recommend using a high VG too many dry hits. A 50/50 blend is it safe choice  :) \u000a\u000a
p271
aVYou should give the suorin drop or the smuorin air a look. I watched a couple reviews and they look like geat starter kits.
p272
aVAgreed...many reviewers give positive comments on the suorin air. It takes salt based juices.
p273
aVOh man. If you want DTL set ups (direct to lung vaping, where you drag on the device like a hookah) I'd each buy matching Voopoo Drags with matching Crown 3's.\u000a\u000aIf you want MTL (mouth to lung vaping devices, where you drag into your mouth and then inhale, like a cigarette), I'd buy 3 Suorin Airs or 3 iStick Pico's with matching Nautilus 2's.\u000a\u000a**but if you don't want to all match** here are some highly recommended atomizers and mods:\u000a\u000aMods:\u000a\u000aVoopoo Drag\u000aTesla Nano 120w\u000aSmoant Battlestar or Charon\u000aVaporesso Revenger\u000aiStick Pico\u000a\u000aAtomizers:\u000a\u000aUwell Crown 3 or Valyrian\u000aTobeco Super Tank Mini\u000aWotofo Flo Tank\u000aAspire Nautilus 2 (MTL or restricted DTL)\u000aHorizontech Arco II\u000a\u000aThe Suorin Air I mentioned is an all in one.

p274
aVPbusardo just review the suorin drop and seemed to like it.
p275
aVMaybe a pod system like the Sourin Drop or Aspire Breeze with some nic salts juice. Hardly any clouds but they will satisfy a nicotine craving. And they would be cheaply replaceable.
p276
aVGet a suorin air with some NKD salt nic juice at 50mg. I have the frost bite flavor and it is amazing, I\u2019ve also heard the brain freeze is badass as well. 
p277
aV&gt; suorin air\u000a\u000aDo you have to use their "Blow Sauce", or can I used juices I already have? I read that site top to bottom and couldn't figure that out. I guess I should have included that I would like to use the juices I have on hand instead of having to buy new ones for a unit that will only be used in an emergency. 
p278
aVYou can refill with standard ejuice. Nicotine salt based fluids just means they use nicotine salt instead of the normal, more commonly known freebase nicotine. Still the same vg/pg flavors as standard juice.\u000a\u000aCheap and popular: icare 2, aspire breeze, limitless, suorin air etc.\u000a\u000abtw all the aforementioned devices work with normal juice. all the pod systems do actually
p279
aVS.O.S. suorin air wont charge and i need nicotine\u000a\u000aComing off a pack a day newport habit, the suorin was a godsend until tonight when it started blinking weird and now it wont charge. Please help me. the same thing happened to my friend's suorin so i doubt its a fluke. Is there any kind of fix? really dont wanna buy another unit when this one is a week old
p280
aVI'm starting to wonder if Suorin is a subsidiary of Smok, but in reality pod mods break easily. It's literally better to get 2 Eleaf Icare 2 or 2 Warlock Rofvape Peas for the same money you'd spend on one of those overpriced pod mods. Ya know or just get an Innokin AIO pen or box mod and call it a day as those are usually unlikely to die until the battery does 1-2 years later.\u000a\u000aYou always have a backup.
p281
aV&gt;the same thing happened to my friend's suorin\u000a&gt;this one is a week old\u000a\u000aThat's a pretty bad failure rate. I'm sorry for your loss.
p282
aVIt's no fluke, it's suorin.\u000a\u000aOver the last weeks, posts like yours crop up quite a lot.\u000a\u000aSo the best answer to your question is "buy a vape", not a piece of crap like you've gotten saddled with. While it's not the answer you were looking for, it's the one that makes most sense.
p283
aVAll of these high airflow devices you guys reccomend ive tried, they do not hit the spot for me like the juul or suorin (when it worked)
p284
aVGet an Innokin Endura T22 kit. Fill it with 30 or 45mg salt liquid. It\u2019s a restricted airflow setup, runs at 14W, and works great. \u000a\u000aI have Juuls and a Sourin, so I know where you\u2019re coming from. The setup I just described is rock solid. Might be a little much, airflow wise,  but you can drop the nic slightly to offset that. \u000a
p285
aVI am not a dick, I am an asshole .)\u000a\u000aBut my point still stands. Just check this sub for problems with this suorin.\u000a\u000aAs for being a fog machine... Check up on MTL, no need for big clouds to get nicotine.\u000a\u000aI can understand your anger, you dished out $30 and essentially threw that money away, you could have gotten any number of MTL-atomizers for that and used your existing mod.
p286
aVThe thing is i dont care how big of a hit i get, i literally cannot get nic sick and i dont feel "harshness" from nicotine. the more the merrier. i can smoke 2 packs back to back, not trying to brag obviously just trying to show you how high my tolerance is. But if the airflow isnt tight like a cig it feels off. the suorin and juul hit *perfect* but ill probably go to the vape shop and try it out if they have it
p287
aVNobody hates salt liquid. Everyone agrees that it's an excellent option for smokers looking to quit. Favorites of this sub such as Bombies and Level Up make it. There may be a bit of a resentment growing towards these systems solely based on the amount of 15YOs coming thru here asking 'is Juul or Suorin best for getting buzzed and where can I hide it from my parents' but nobody is going to tell a quitting smoker other than to go with what works for them.
p288
aVBecause for $25 you can get a mod that perfectly simulates the draw of a cigarette with double the liquid capacity and about triple the battery capacity that'll actually last you 1 - 2 years.\u000a\u000aThe only benefit you get from a pod mod is it's as small or looks similar to a cigarette. I don't vape for how things look in my hand or how they behave like a cigarette. I vape for nicotine, to stay off cigarettes.\u000a\u000aIf I'm going to buy a pod mod it's not going to cost me an arm and a leg just to keep replacing it. If you're so willing to pay $150 then just go buy 6 more Suorin Airs and you'll solve your problems until you need 6 more.
p289
aVYa that makes sense. I was just feeling around for something like the suorin or juul bc you guys know all the new stuff and half the people are trying to sell me on a regular vape that i can guarantee i know more about than them, again not bragging it was just my hobby for so long. Pair all of this with deeply craving nicotine and sheeit
p290
aVOk so tell me the name of this mystery mod so i can buy it lol. If it really hits like the suorin then ill buy it, no brainer
p291
aVGateway back to smoking? You gotta be kidding me. when my suorin was working the last thing i wanted was a 'Port. The hit was so clean and satisfying and *real* 
p292
aVI second the recommendation of the endura. I went for the T20 instead of the 22 and only regret it because the hit is a tiny bit too airy. As for your suorin problem, i\u2019ve had 2 suorin airs and one broke because I dropped it in water and the other broke because I dropped it onto concrete from quite a few feet up. Both were my fault. If you want to try fixing the suorin, the blinking blue means that the connectors are dirty. Use a q-tip or tissue to clean it out and maybe try again. As for maintenance for the suorin, I used to take the pod out maybe twice a day and wipe off any liquid that may have leaked out to prevent the dirty connector problem. I know many people have been having problems with them but either I got lucky or I was doing something right. I know my sample size was miniscule, but both broke due to user error not an error on suorin\u2019s part. 
p293
aV&gt; Has anybody else experienced this?  ....or doing something seriously wrong when I prime?\u000a\u000aMan, the iCare *was* great when it first came out.  With each subsequent re-order I received, the quality greatly worsened to the point where even looking at the iCare would shatter the built-in glass tank.  I decided to stop carrying the iCare because of the issues you mentioned.\u000a\u000aThen I brought in the Boulder Rock.  It's still a pretty damn good device for nicotine salts, but as you mentioned, the pull and flavor could be better.  I think this has to be from the silica wick, you're just going to get that much better flavor from cotton since it is more absorbent than silica.  The Boulder Rock does solve the QA issues and also fixed the iCare's issues of constant leaking and breakage.\u000a\u000aI almost picked up the Suorin Air, before deciding to go the distance with the Kimsun Slim.  In my humble opinion, the Suorin Air is great as a novelty, but I feel the hit it gives is severly underpowered and the credit card shape feels unnatural in the hand when vaping.\u000a\u000aNow the Kimsun Slim 2R.  It's different than anything I've ever tried.  I think it's because it's the first refillable disposable pod system that uses temperature control titanium wire instead of wattage and kanthal.  The first 15-30 pulls is just pure cotton taste, and because it's not silica wick like the Juul or Boulder Rock, the burn in is longer than any other ultraportable you may have used.  Here are two tips I do to make the Kimsun better:\u000a\u000a* The pods come with two clear rubber stoppers that plug the mouthpiece and airhole.  I cut the airhole plug in half, and put it back in, to decrease the draw and increase the flavor.\u000a\u000a* Remove the two stickers on the side of the Kimsun to see your juice level better\u000a\u000a\u000aAs of right now, I think the Kimsun is the best device on the market to use to Max VG nicotine *and* 50/50 nicotine salts.  Is it perfect?  No, but we're getting there.  If and when I can find a device that provides superior flavor to the Kimsun, you bet I will carry it in the store.  \u000a\u000a\u000aLet me know what you think --

aVHey Bombies!! I just purchased three After Dark flavors after switching to the Suorin Drop only a week ago and I\u2019m beyond excited to try them! \u000a\u000aUnfortunately, I am not running into the same smooth experience with my device itself. After testing various juices that I could quickly find locally, I seem to be stuck with the same issue of burning the cotton too quickly in my pods. \u000a\u000aI only switched to a mod after tiring from the Juul and its issues, and I was really hoping my solution to my troubleshooting with the Drop was just finding the right juice. \u000a\u000aI\u2019m awaiting my Bombies package to arrive, but since I managed to catch this post I was wondering if you could please advise a pod mod that I could try and snag before my juice comes? I\u2019d love to get a reliable set up working and if the Kimsun is the answer I\u2019d buy right away. I\u2019d really appreciate some insight!! Thank you.
p295
aVThe kimsun would be a good option, it's not quite mouth to lung though. I think it will probably be a little more airy than the Suorin, but in terms of it as a pod device it works great. If you want something a little less airy maybe our boulder rocks, but I think you may be pleased with the Kimsun.
p296
aVejuice is made of PG (Propylene Glycol), VG (Vegetable Glycerin), nicotine (optional), and flavoring. It is better than cigarettes because it doesn't have the thousands of chemicals and other shit that cigarettes do.\u000a\u000a\u000aIf you don't want huge clouds and just want your nicotine fix you'll want some sort of pod like the Juul, Sourin Drop, Breeze, Penguin etc. Or you can go with the AIO like the [T20 or T18](https://www.truenorthvapor.com/collections/starter-kits/endura). There are many more AIO that's just an example.

aVSuorin Air not drawing\u000a\u000aJust picked up a new cartridge and out of the box its not drawing, if I take the cartridge out I can't get any air to flow through by breathing through the mouthpiece, it's as if something is stuck in it. Is there any easy fix or should I just buy a new cartridge?
p298
aVPost from two years ago mentioning that he's 15, gonna be cutting it damn close to 18 by now.\u000a\u000aI'm kinda agreeing with mund, there's been a huge influx in sourin issues threads.

aVmy Suorin Drop thoughts\u000a\u000aPersonally i\u2019ve had the juul, both suorin airs and the drop and I can easily say the drop is my favorite of the 3. I use Mr. SaltE juice and the flavor and airflow is just unmatchable to any other device i\u2019ve used. The shape and weight make it very easy to keep track of and use and honestly i\u2019m a huge fan of the drop and suggest it to everyone
p301
aVIt's a good start to a review, however, with the recent influx of Suorin stuff failing, I'd love your feedback after longer use. Comparison to the other devices you have would be nice as well. Lastly, pictures!

aVMy Suorin Air is burning all my pods\u000a\u000aI bought my Suorin Air about a week and a half ago. I read the instructions and waited 5-8 minutes before hitting it after filling up my pod with juice. Within the first day, my pod's coils burnt. I decided to buy a new pod hoping that maybe I ripped the first one a bit too often and that not all Suorin pods are like this. I started being super careful about hitting it, only hitting it at the most every 30 seconds and I'd often end up taking minutes between rips because I was scared of the coils in my pod burning. Later that night, my new pod got burnt. This has happened another 2 times, with me buying pods out of desperation because I've been looking for something more affordable (pods wise) than the Juul and the Phix. By the way, I'm using Mr. Salt -E juice\u000a\u000aHas this happened to anyone else before? Did I buy a messed up Suorin? I'd really appreciate y'all's insight :)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

aVSuorin Drop Issue\u000a\u000aSo i just bought a suorin drop last night and thought it was great.  I put it on the charger before i went to bed, and when I woke up this morning it wont fire.  I cant seem to figure out why.  If anyone is having a similar problem or knows a solution, please respond.
p311
aVStandard nicotine is a freebase, meaning the outer electron shell is open and actively bonds.  This nic also leaves your system quickly and can be quite harsh.  Salt based nicotine is far closer to the form found in the plant and the outer electron shell is almost fulfilled.  (think noble gasses but not actually filled)  This leads to almost like a time release in your system, the nicotine stays longer.  It's also less harsh as noted in other comments, most companies hit it with a small amount of one of two types of acid to introduce throat hit.  I've vaped salt nic for about two years now from the juul to bottled liquids in other devices. I love it.  Typically you'll find nic strengths in 20,25,30,35,45,50 .  Always remember that these are not exactly suitable for high power applications.  I use a 25 in an ATOpack Penguin. 45's in suorin products or similar low watt, semi-closed loop devices.  
p312
aVI can suggest the Suorin Air. Its small, light weight and pretty solid. It has a 450Mah battery but with regular use it will last a solid 3 hours. It charges to full in less than 15 min so once it dies its quick to re charge. Pods arent too bad either, 4-5$ depending on where you find them, they can last upwards of two weeks depending on the juice you use. 
p313
aVI just got my Suorin Air a few days ago. So far so good! Hits really well, blows great clouds. It\u2019s sleek and very beautiful imo it\u2019s as small as a credit card and can slip right into your wallet. There\u2019s a variety of colors (I have rose gold, it\u2019s v pretty \U0001f338) would definitely recommend Suorin Air!!!
p314
aVSuorin Air is definitely a solid device, www.saltnic.com offers a combo with the device and 30ml of juice (I recommend Mango 25mg, it's delicious) for $30. Not sure if the Reddit20 code still works for 20% off or not.\u000a\u000aOtherwise go to Mt. Baker Vapor and get he Joyetech AIO for free with code FLAVORNOW, and also load it up with that mango juice. Good stuff!\u000a\u000aOh and the Innokin T20S is also an awesome device IMO.
p315
aVI really like mine. Instead of carrying around my normal set up when Im at work or on campus its a lot better then my VT200 and Herakles RTA which is rather bulky. Its also a plus because my university is smoke free which as of this semester includes any form of vaping so the Suorin is easy enough to conceal with smaller amount of vapor.  
p316
aVi have a Suorin Air and a Bo, if you are simply looking for nicotine delivery then i suggest the Bo.

aVThe new [Mi One MiPod] (https://www.vapordna.com/SV-Mi-Pod-Ultra-Portable-Kit-p/svmipo.htm) has a 950mah built in battery and is apparently a really good pod system. It's quite new so I don't know if anyone here has one yet. The mi-pod is $37.99 w/ coupon code 5off. If you decide to get it and get more stuff use coupon code dna10. There's also the [Suorin Drop &amp; Solace Bundle] (https://www.vapordna.com/Holiday-Promotion-Suorin-Drop-and-Solace-Bundle-p/hpsula.htm?1=1&amp;CartID=2) for $20 w/ coupon code Drop. You get the Suorin Drop and 2 15ml bottles of Solace nic salts ejuice. The drop only has a 310mah battery though.

aVHi /u/_Bombies! Off your recommendation from a previous post, I just purchased a Kimsun Slim 2r. However, I had another concern, regarding all the warnings I see/hear from Nic Salt vendors to not use Nicotine Salts with sub-ohm devices.\u000a\u000a*Since the Kimsun has a 0.25ohm resistance coil, I was wondering if this falls in that category? \u000a*\u000a\u000aThe Suorin Drop, which I am currently using, claims a resistance of 1.3-1.4 ohms and is 'optimized' for Nic Salts, and another product I was looking at -- the Atopack Dolphin -- offers two MTL coils in 0.6ohm and 1.2ohm, as well as a DL 0.25ohm. /u/aWanderer01 was able to give me some feedback on his time with the Dolphin and claims the DL isn't nearly as effective as MTL (assuming 1.2ohm, and you're using Nic Salts?)\u000a\u000aSince we're talking Bombies, I was hoping you'd be able to let me know how well the juice burns in these circumstances. Is there a big difference between the Nicotine Salt 50VG/50PG versions of the After Dark line and the ~70VG/30PG versions with "freebased" nicotine in regards to sub-ohm devices -- specifically the Kimsun?\u000a\u000a
p320
aVThe Juul will definitely work mate; the pods work out to be 59mg nicotine per ml. For ref, I managed to kill a 19 year pack a day habit on something with the same power output as the Juul and 18mg per ml. The pods are spendy tho; you can refill them but it might be a bit more fannying around than you can be bothered with. \u000a\u000aThere's a rash of pod systems out just now and also little ultraportables that you can put your own juice into. You can get bottled 50mg liquid from Mr Salt E and Level Up (I'm sure there's others by now). I don't know a whole heap about them but have a poke around for the following: ICare, Aspire Breeze, Suorin, Boulder Rock, Rofvape Peas and the Limitless...shit...Limitless wee thing that looks like a flash drive. Oh, and also /u/templetam's review of the Dolphin a couple of hours ago.

aVHigh quality device for high nic vaping?\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve been vaping since the ego twist days, and have been on the sub-ohm train for the last few years, but this new suorin air with nic salt juice has made me feel like high nic/low power might be my end game.  Since these devices are all fairly cheap and seem to have pretty low reliability reports, are there any high end devices that support this kind of vape experience?

aVSuorin Air keeps firing\u000a\u000aHi guys. I bought a suorin air (my second) and it's been working fine for the past 2 weeks up until today when it kept firing after I hit it. I tried to see if it was just hitting for a few seconds after I used it but it just keeps firing. Not really sure what to do so if anyone can help me out that'd be great, thanks! 
p324
aVAlso i was advised that when letting the device sit or turned off for periods of time, I assumed this was like over night when you are sleeping. To remove the suorin air pod(Juice conatiner) and keep it separate. Supposedly the juice and leak out of the container and leak into the inside and onto the components. So take it apart clean the insides.(By getting a flat head screwdriver and prying the plastic near the suorin logo). Then just keep the pod off the device when not being used
p325
aVSo a day later the suorin crapped out for good. Turns out theyre not made to be on 24/7 lol. Just got a new one in gold that im gonna try to keep for longer. 
p326
aVPLEASE HELP! My suorin was firing by itself and I looked at the comments above and cleaned it. IT SMELLS LIKE FIRE AND TASTES LIKE FIRE. Anyone know what I can do ? Or do I just have to buy another one? 
p327
aVSo i have just ran into an issue that I can\u2019t find a solution to. My suorin air keeps firing even while it\u2019s turned off and so I need to remove the pod from further heating. But when I turn it on the blue or red malfunction light flashes sowley, but when I turn it off there are blue and red lighted blinking very quick just like a strobe light would... do I need to replace the whole thing or is there a fix I\u2019m missing? And extra thing, my sensor is in poor condition. Are there replacement firing sensors anywhere?
p328
aVHonestly with all the issues you just posted I'd buy another suorin. Another thing you could try is pushing out the device from its case and cleaning the juice off of it, you do that by pushing on the inside part where you'd normally put your pod and it comes out. Are you leaving your pods in for an extended period of time? The juice is most likely leaking from the pod and into your device overnight 
p329
aVI just read what his problem was and it was exactly like mine but I was gonna have to go with that solution of buying another sourin.

aVReview of Menthol Nic Salt Brands for Menthol Ex Smokers.\u000a\u000aHey guys!  Almost 4 months cigarette free here after 32 years as a menthol smoker with a TON of help from the great folks in this sub! YAY!  I just wanted to post a little review of some Menthol and Mint Nic Salt juices that I have used in the last few months and how they work for someone who was a hardcore lover of Marlboro Menthol Lights forever.  I quit with a Juul and I do love the taste of the Juul mint pods but they are ridiculously expensive so last month I bought a Suorin Air and after a few hacks and tricks and a learning curve it's working great. The question was with all the choices out there which juice would satisfy my desire for a MTL menthol hit.  Your mileage may vary here as these are just my opinions. I have 5 menthol Nic Salt Juices that are all about the same Nic strength.  These are in order of what I found to be the best MTL hit to satisfy this ex smoker.\u000a\u000a- Brain Freeze by Naked 100 Salts  this is the one! It smells like strawberries (my coworkers often tell me that they can smell nothing but juicy fruit gum when it's in my pocket) That is not what it tastes like though. It's a slight fruity hit but it's like sucking an altoid into your lungs in a menthol cigarette. It's amazing. It is truly freezing cold! I don't recommend vaping this outside in the winter. It makes me shiver, for real! \u000a- Dragonthol by Solace this is a really close 2nd and is my other all day vape.  Very cool actual menthol (not peppermint) and a slight dragonfruit taste. If the color purple had a taste this is it. LOL. \u000a- Mint Salts by CRFT this one is slightly lower nic but it is still a true menthol taste. If you were looking to refill a juul pod this a really good choice. \u000a\u000aThe two I didn't care for \u000a\u000a- Level Up Minty Menthol Salts. I really wanted to like this after many good reviews but to me it tastes like old peppermint candy at Grandma's house.  It's too peppermint and not a true menthol.\u000a\u000a- Mr. Salt E Mint.  This one was really my least favorite because it's got a sweet vanilla side taste that I just can't get used to. I'm not a fan of vanilla at all so that is probably why I don't like this one. It's also quite a bit thicker in consistency than the others and it doesn't vape well in the pod devices.  \u000a\u000aSo FWIW, that was my month long journey into figuring out what tastes like a menthol smoke and what doesn't. I hope someone finds this info useful! \u000a\u000aStay quit y'all! It's totally worth every minute of it.

aVCheck out my post on the Rubi and mi pod. I like yourself are on the suorin air hype train. I still only have the V1, I hope they didn\u2019t mess with the air flow on the V2 which I\u2019ll be picking up next week.

aVRubi and Mi-pod review\u000a\u000aLittle background on my vaping experience. I have been vaping for about 6-7 years. I have purchased countless mods, tanks, rta, rda you name it. About a year and a half ago, I went full circle and was done with the rebuilding/mods. I have been exclusively vaping the juul since. So, with all the new salt nic eliquid companies entering the game. I am in the market once again/never ending search for the perfect vape with the less hassle. I am really into the draw activated devices hence this review/ thoughts.\u000a\u000aSo, my thoughts on the rubi and mi-pod. First off both devices did not meet expectations. The Rubi gave me a burnt taste about half way thru the first pod, it probably would\u2019ve been more noticeable at first but I was using a tobacco flavored eliquid (salt nic cubano). On the second pod I filled it and let it sit overnight using NKD freeze salt nic. After just a few hits I could taste slight burnt taste. I think the issue lies with the holes that feed the coil, they are way too small. Kinda like the old cartos we used to bore out. The device itself is quite impressive, however they need to redesign the pods to make it feed better.\u000a      Moving on to the mi-pod. It has way to much airflow for a good MTL. The tip is very awkward \u000aand uncomfortable. The actual vapor doesn\u2019t come out of the center of the tip, more to one side so it affects the way it hits the tongue. It wasn\u2019t a terrible experience, just not my cup of tea.\u000a     Now enter the Suorin Air. I actually purchased this device quite a while back. I picked it up super cheap with like 10 pods. I guess they were dumping them before the V2 came out. I initially used one pod with some 12nic juice and wasn\u2019t satisfied and sat on a shelf for a long time. So, when I was messing with these other devices last weekend, I said fuck it I\u2019ll try these juices with the saurin. And let me tell you it was on fucking point. Perfect draw for me, I\u2019ve filled the pod a couple times and almost ready for a third time and it is still vaping great. Probably gonna pick up the V2 next week. I like having 2 devices with me at the same time like I do with the juul. Using different flavors on the fly.\u000a\u000aHope this helps some of you guys.

aVBig ups to the G-Jeff for popping on here. Not only am I a G-Jeff too, but I love the customer service!\u000a\u000aI've been loving the salt nic/pod vape after having come for circle after six years of vaping. Enough so that I don't even know where my vaporesso revenger is right now; it's been months.\u000a\u000aMy Aspire Breeze has gotten to the point that I'm charging it several times a day, I lost my MyJet and my Suorin Drop stopped working after a brief two weeks of use. Today I finally decided to go for a replacement. After calling a few shops, who all advocated for the Drop, I found a shop that was bonkers for the MiPod. \u000a\u000aI'd rather roll the dice on something new than risk further disappointment with another Drop, so I decided to swing by and give the MiPod a shot (after ruling out the Roll Badge and Infinix from SMOK).\u000a\u000aIt's only been 12 hours, but here are my quick thoughts...\u000a\u000a- crazy lightweight\u000a- freakishly sturdy for it's plasticness\u000a- I keep expecting it to die, but it's still indicating 3.7v!!! How can that be???\u000a- flavor is great and the vape is on the warm side, which I love!\u000a- possible leaking issues when laid on side for a while... I've had two juicy hits that were gross\u000a- it does get warm on one side of the pod... bothersomely so, but, I just put my lips around the box itself and all is good\u000a- best airflow ever! great lung hits without feeling like you're stressing an MTL device\u000a- love stealth mode\u000a- seriously...the LED is still bright blue! Is it broken? Will it last forever? Who knows?!?

aVSuorin Drop Issues - Help!\u000a\u000aSo I purchased the Suprin Drop to take on an international vacation. I have been vaping since 2011, but much less often these days, so this device was perfect to meet my needs for this trip even knowing it would be far from my go to RDA/box at 70 watts. I wanted convenience. Picked it up at the local vape shop and it worked great for a day. \u000a\u000aNow, here at my resort earlier today the device blinked red, so I plugged it in and went to dinner. Came back after dinner and it no longer works. The device has power, because it just blinks blue 3-4 times when I try to take a hit. But the atomizer never activates. No vapor, just blue LED blinks. This was the first time I\u2019ve ever charged it. \u000a\u000aI filled up and swapped a new cartridge thinking I might have torched the original or something. No luck, same result. I\u2019m pretty bummed about it... ended up bumming a couple cigs from strangers after a few drinks.\u000a\u000aSo I\u2019m really just wondering if anyone has experienced this with the Suorin Drop (not Air), or if there are any suggestions to try to get this thing working again. I didn\u2019t bring the manual with me since the device was super straightforward and easy to get working. If there are any owners that can check the FAQ for any tips even, that might be helpful. I\u2019m extremely desperate!!\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

aVSourin air pod burns Quickly?\u000a\u000aSo I bought a sourin a few weeks ago but my friend lost it so he bought me another one. This one has a significantly smaller cotton and seems to burn out after a couple days. I'm already on my 2nd pod and I really don't want to keep buying them.  After a quick search it looks like this happens to a lot of people too.  Is there a way to get the old pods that didn't give me this problem?
p346
aVSuorin Air vs Suorin Drop (Is the air an outdated version?)\u000a\u000aI was about to buy a Suorin Air, but I noticed the drop model for $10 more. I like the looks of the air more I think, but is it an outdated model? If I buy it will I be able to keep buying pods, or is the Drop the new big thing for Suorin? I don't want to buy something that will be discontinued soon or something. Basically are they separate things, or is one a newer version? Also, is the drop objectively better? I couldn't find a very good comparison online.

aVBlinking Blue LED on Sourin Air Problem\u000a\u000aSo I bought two Sourin Air e-cigarettes about 4 days ago. It has worked absolutely perfectly up until today. The blue LED light on the bottom constantly blinks as long as the device is turned on. It does not fire on its own, but the blinking LED is draining my battery, and is kind of annoying. At this point, it is more of me figuring out how to fix it than anything else. It still fires fine and everything, the light just won't stop blinking as if there is a charger connected to it. I have taken it apart and cleaned everything, including the pins. But, that obviously didn't work or else I wouldn't be posting. If you have run into this problem, know anything about it, or have ANY suggestions, please let me know. It's actually killing me at this point and I can't even enjoy the fucker without it pestering me. \u000a\u000aEDIT : I solved the problem. I must have had juicy hands and turned the power on. There was a large amount of juice stuck underneath and inside the power switch. Simply took the power button off and cleaned around it with a w-tip. Works like a champ now.

aVSuorin Drop\u000a\u000aWill 50mg nic juice fuck up my pods? Is that too high for suorin drops
p349
aVThe Suorin Drop is made for nic salts.

aVYou can add whatever you like - because salts are generally higher mg, it's not recommended to use them in big chunky setups, lower power devices like the Suorin and Juul and whatnot are ideal. If you're using 'traditional' juices, stay around 50/50 to 65VG/35PG - much higher VG than that and shit gets to thick to wick and vaporize effectively because the device doesn't have enough grunt.
p351
aVOnce it starts to taste burnt. Suorin says 5 refills but i've gotten many more than that out of a pod.

aVSuorin CBD Oil?\u000a\u000a[deleted]
p358
aVSuorin Air Burnt Taste\u000a\u000aHello,\u000aI have had a suorin air for about 2 weeks and have only finished one full pod. I refilled the pod this morning and it tastes very burnt and disgusting. What can I do? I am using the same juice as I was before.\u000aThanks\u000a
p359
aVThe Suorin Air pods are unfortunately very susceptible to burnt cotton if you don't allow the juice to soak in for about 5-10 minutes before using them.  I've gone through quite a few pods myself and unfortunately, once they're burnt...they're burnt.      \u000a\u000aThe best practice I've found is to get a new pod, fill it with the juice of your choice and allow it to sit for approximately 10 minutes before hitting it.  During those 10 minutes, I'll do a few pulls on the cartridge itself to assist with pulling the juice into the cotton.  That seems to work and I haven't had any burnt pods since I started doing it like this. 
p360
aVYep. I solved this issue. Go to you tube and search a video called Suorin Air Hack with a Hawaiian guy. Basically what you so is take the tiny metal tab that us between the contacts on the pods off with your finger nail and it will increase the Airflow and stop the burnt taste. Also make sure you let them wick with new juice a good 30 min.  My pods last a week to 10 days now. 
p361
aVIf you want something REALLY small, I'd recommend the Suorin Air or Suorin Drop...but those are made to be used with nicotine salts, so not sure if you're into that.  If you want a sub-ohm type setup, maybe something like the Priv v8 kit that's a single 18650 setup in a compact form factor. 
p362
aVSuorin Air stopped hitting suddenly.\u000a\u000aIt was hitting fine this morning and all of a sudden stopped. I cleaned the whole thing and tried 2 other pods and they don't work. I currently have a new pod in with good quality juice. The light is blue when I plugged it in. Can someone help me please?
p363
aVSome other notes:\u000aIf left standing on desk all the time it seems to be ok, but of course I need to take it with me and it usually leaks after bouncing in my pocket. Tried pants pocket, chest pocket and book bag pocket. Chest pocket was the quickest and worst cause it would go on its side.\u000aMisfires in pocket or hand seems to burn out coil instantly and the pods leak.\u000aI've really done what I can to eliminate user related issues but it's just a headache. 3 pods and 7 coils later it has not gotten any better. \u000a\u000aThe other pod I've used is the Suorin that's the thin credit card sized one. When left sitting for a day or two it would leak as well. Not sure if its cause I use max VG. \u000a\u000a
p364
aVSourin breeze 2 problems\u000a\u000aSo I put in a new coil and juice and puffed it a few times after letting it soak and it was fine, but then I plugged it in to charge over night and the next morning, the coil was burnt, anyone experience similar problems?
p365
aVsourin? or aspire breeze 2?\u000ai've had that problem with the aspire breeze 2. i always let the device warm up a little. i don't take a full first drag. i do this on all my vapes just as a precaution\u000a\u000awhat coils are you using?
p366
aVfuck a burning bush pass me a big L\u000a\u000aIn which Slumberland asks who should have the next wave of technology? My short list is smok, joyetech, suorin's designer, or evolve. It would be best served by evolv, but they ain't fucked with hardware hardware since the darwin....\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000almk
p367
aVWhich device?\u000a\u000aHello everyone, so after heavy thought, I'm done with crappy smok products. \u000a\u000aI was looking at a few pod devices but cant decide which one. Which of the following do you guys thing would be the best option for me? I want something with coils or pods that last like 2 weeks or so. \u000a\u000aAspire nautilus \u000aAspire spryte\u000aAspire breeze 2\u000aMi-Pod\u000aSuorin air\u000aOther (please list) \u000a\u000aI'm leaning heavily towards the aspire breeze 2. 
p368
aVIs Suorin Air really that vulnerable to malfunctions?\u000a\u000aSo,  I've been looking for a good, portable open pod vape with long battery life that would also look as inconspicuous and elegant as possible, mostly for MTL high nic vaping, not cloud chasing. The one that really caught my attention was Suorin Air, it basically has the perfect size and design for what I'm looking for and also manages to have big, 2ml pods and a long-lasting battery. I was close to actually buying one, but I noticed that most of the suorin air subreddit is littered with posts about how it keeps autofiring even when its off, the pods sweating or the device being completely broken and useless straight out of the box. Most of youtube videos that cover the device are tutorials how to repair it or avoid burning it, but the reviews never mention the fact that it seems to be extremely vulnerable to malfunctions because of many design flaws. So, is the Suorin actually as bad as it seems? If yes, then is there any pod vape that would be similiar in design? (I've looked into breeze 2, mipod, smok pod vapes, suorin drop, smoant, and they all seem to either have even more flaws or just dont really look as good as air)
p369
aVHow\u2019s the budget? The lost vape Orion is really good but really pricey. \u000a\u000aAlso having used and throw away two suorin devices I would recommend against them but that\u2019s just me. 
p370
aVThis hasn't been my experience really; I've never noticed my Suorin Air malfunctioning in any way. I bought my original one in August, still works great albeit with lessened battery life over the last month or so. I primarily use it at work and any time I have an intense cigarette craving and charge it up every couple of hours, though, it's not my favored system anymore otherwise. I've graduated to a Mi Pod as my regular pod system outside of work but I kept the SA I bought for my husband--he's more receptive to DL systems it seems--for when mine eventually dies because it really does the trick for me when a cigarette craving hits.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aIf you're just wanting to try out a pod system you can't go wrong with this one as a starter of sorts, I bought mine for $18 or so. Expect to either have a backup in case, though, although mine has been perfect for my uses it is pretty damn cheap.
p371
aVI used to use Sourin Air/Drop for awhile. It did the fix for a short time. Like mentioned, you'll go through several of them. But I mean, while I was just getting into e-cigs/vapes, it was my first one and got me to wean off cigs and that was my primary goal. After my 4th one, I decided to just get a mipod after seeing pretty good reviews and i looooooOOOOooove it.  \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aPro(s)\u000a\u000aBattery - fantastic. I hit it often and it'll last a day and a half, sometimes two days  \u000aflavor - pretty good, I use nic salts.  \u000ahit - awesome MTL &amp; DTL.  \u000agreat customer service; I got some 'old pods' and they burnt bad (combined with cheap juice), and SV sent me two packs in like three days after I sent one email\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aCon(s)\u000a\u000aBad juice = bad time   \u000aA little pricier  \u000aDifficult to find shops that carry pods (I live in OH, and I only know of two shops up by me that carry the pods/mod.)  \u000a\u000a\u000aI have more info in my comment history. It's gotten me off cigs completely, but the Sourins were good for starting, just dont expect it to last long without crapping out on  you, and don't expect a superb flavor. Pods can be hit or miss, too. 
p372
aVMi-Pod is ok, but they aren\u2019t really heavy duty, coils don\u2019t last too long and the device itself isn\u2019t too durable. Check out the Lost Vape Orion, the Aspire Breeze 2, or Suorin Air. Also check out the zenith Kroma kit by Innokin. Mtl device with better coils and battery but a bit bigger than what you\u2019re looking for.
p373
aVI'm not a fan of the suorin. I preferably want something that comes with two pods and is portable within the 30 dollar range. I'm looking for a pod system specifically.  I hate juuls, I liked the smok infinix and the novo, but they just break. I've heard a lot of good about the mi pod, but I really dont know. 
p374
aVIs it safe to bring a vape into Japan?\u000a\u000aI'm going to Japan in a couple of weeks and I was planning to bring my Suorin Air and probably a small 30 mL bottle. Is this legal or would I run into any trouble at customs? And if it's allowed, do I have to declare it? 
p375
aVas a carry-on you'll be fine.  I don't know the sourin air I just recommend you empty the tank, carry the cells in a storage case, and separate all of it including your juice.  30 ml's is acceptable to import.   If you plan to have an extended stay know that e-liquid is illegal for sale here so order your juice now if you have a delivery address of a friend that resides here.  Local law is 120ml per month for personal use the last I checked but really, who is watching? wink wink
p376
aVThe Suorin Vagon aughta be in contention for worst pod in my view. Lots of promise, and delivers on none of it, unless you like to vape unflavored.\u000a\u000aThe Metis mix may be running for worst in show for Subohm tanks. Nothing but vapor lock and cottony flavor when it works since I've gotten it.
p377
aVAgreed. My friend at a distribution warehouse hooks me up with gear, including the Suorin Vag. After a week or so, maybe a drop or so, it was no longer able to keep it's pods attached. I have to hold it together with my fingers to keep it together for tokes. New pods have the same result. In addition to poor design/human error, the taste was weak compared to my old Smok Infinix and my new Rincoe CETO(which I absolutely adore)
p378
aVBad luck with pod systems\u000a\u000aSo i\u2019ve been trying to find a small device that takes nic salt but i\u2019ve been having issues. I got the suorin drop and smok nick and i has the same issue with both: the device would continue firing after i hit it to the point where i\u2019ve burnt a handful of pods on each. I think i\u2019ve done everything right, i pruned them properly, i made sure to inhale to draw the juice through. The owner of the vape shop i go to told me to cover the hole on the bottom and inhale hard. I wipe any leakage near the connectors whenever i see it and they still auto fire. Am i doing something wrong or are these devices just shitty? If they\u2019re bad devices, what are recommendations for better ones?
p379
aVAnyone interested in Baja Blast flavored juice?\u000a\u000aI made a post here a while ago about baja blast salt nic juice I was working on. I have the formula from my old ejuice company selling regular vape juice and I\u2019ve adapted it to work in the juul / phix / sourin drop, it\u2019s turned out to be pretty awesome and I feel i\u2019ve perfected the flavor. \u000a\u000aJust wondering if anyone else wanted some of this to refill their pods/devices. If you\u2019re interested just send me an email at bajablastpods@gmail.com and I can ship you a bottle of baja blast nic salt juice. I also have a mango flavor that\u2019s a lot better than the popular ejuice companies if anyone is interested. \u000a\u000aThe flavor and overall quality is way better in my opinion than a lot of the popular refill juices. It\u2019s not overly harsh and I only used the highest quality nic salts and ingredients so it\u2019s a very smooth flavor that doesn\u2019t burn your mouth while still delivering a great throat hit and buzz. It\u2019s what i\u2019m vaping now so if anyone\u2019s interested just send me an email and let me know. \u000a\u000aIt\u2019s finally ready, available in regular nicotine and nicotine salts.
p380
aVDefinitely go with a refillable option, Breeze, Orion, suorin, etc. much better than prefills.
p381
aVNeed help quitting\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve been vaping for a while now, ever since my dumbass teen self thought it would be cool. Now that I\u2019m out of the house I don\u2019t have a job, parents won\u2019t give me allowance, I\u2019m in college, and I\u2019m broke. So I can\u2019t afford vaping. I tried to have a one week hiatus but after day one I had a splitting headache and I couldn\u2019t resist the minty mango 5% from my suorin air. Now I\u2019m quitting for good. I threw out my juul cause I realized just how bad it is for my body. Three days in and I\u2019m getting the headaches, the moodiness, and I\u2019m dreaming about hitting my juul which is fucking sad. Does anyone have any tips for quitting vaping? It\u2019s tearing my life apart and I need to stop
p382
aVI am not a doctor, this is not medical advice. That said, from experience: \u000a\u000aQuitting cold turkey from a high nicotine device is very difficult. Since you have a Sourin Air, which is refillable, you can taper off a bit more slowly. I assume you currently have 50mg/ml, so pre-purchase a small bottle of 30mg/ml, and a few steps down from there (18mg/ml, 12mg/ml, 6mg/ml, etc...). Once you finish the high nic bottle, step down to the next one. You'll vape more initially after each step down but it'll taper off back to a "normal" amount of vaping by the end of the bottle. It'll be easier to cold-turkey a lower nic habit at that point.\u000a\u000aThat said, you mentioned being broke and only three days in. You can try toughing it out for a week and you should be over "the hump" when it comes to cravings. Avoid self-control lowering habits (like drinking) during this time. The cravings will be there for a long while, but take each day at a time. Replace the physical habit with something more innocuous (get a bag of those mini-lollypops and pop one of those each time you get a strong craving). You're not just breaking a nicotine addiction, you're breaking the habits that lead to that addiction. 
p383
aVThis is what I would and have done before in the past, but, and I could be missing something here, 50 mg/ml would be toxic.  I mix my own juice, but the last few times I've been in a shop, which has been a while, they wont even let you go above 24 mg/ml for safety reasons.  To my knowledge, 32mg/ml is the highest one can go without causing any nicotine poisoning.  \u000a\u000aYou say that you are at 5%, so I will assume you mean 5mg/ml.  If I were you, I'd dig that sourin air out of the trash and go to walmart and pick up some VG for roughly $4 from the pharmacy section.  Now what you can do is use the VG to gradually dilute your juice more and more, which makes the nicotine level drop.  I dont know how much juice you have, but measure it all out and estimate how long it will last you for.  If you have 30 mg and 10 mg will last you a week, then dilute it every 3 to 4 days.  by the end, you should be vaping just straight VG and you should be able to be ready to retire the vape entirely by that point, but vaping a 0 mg juice can still be therapeutic to somebody trying to quit.\u000a\u000aOf course, this relies on your ability to retrieve the mod from the trash.  You're kind of stuck quitting cold turkey if you cant get it back.
p384
aVHow long does an Orion pod last? +rant\u000a\u000aI just bought A Suorin Drop, I had been using my friend's to see how I liked it and he and I have had good experiences with it and the longevity of the pods when using nic salt. I was using a Smok Mag mod, which I assumed was quite popular and was a hand me down. I used it quite a bit but have always been taking breaks from it to prove to myself I'm not addicted, but then I just got tired of it. I enjoy the clouds i got from it, but no longer care for that anymore. After not using it for about 2 months I decided that I liked the portability and ease of the Drop pod system. I honestly do not like the wastefulness of pod systems, and obviously pods will eventually not be made anymore. Since I've slowly been not using vapes nearly as often, i enjoy just sitting down and having a few long pulls and being overwhelmed by the 50mg salt nic. So, when I went in to the vape shop to purchase it, immediately after this asshole at the store starts talking, says he never cared for the drop and yadda yadda blah blah blah. I knew of the Orion, but I'm not super deep into the whole vape scene, i was just eased into it by a friend. He starts telling me that the "most superior" pod system came out: The Orion. I liked the idea of the Orion being a small mod like pod system, but this guy was seriously just shitting on my buy right after I got it, in his shop. For a hot minute I felt bad that I didn't just put down a little extra to buy an Orion. Regardless, he told me he had the same pod in his Orion for 6 weeks so far. I would find that hard to believe, but he has like 300 million vapes probably so I doubt thats how much it would last for a chain-vaping maniac. I've been trying to research how long they last on average, but haven't been able to find that info. I may just suck at searching and its probably already answered on this reddit page. I'm still happy with my buy, I like the look of the drop and the solid colours you can get it in, but I know that if I keep vaping, I'll never want to get something as big as the Mag again. \u000a\u000aTLDR:\u000a\u000aWould it ever be worth it to upgrade to the Orion for the adaptability of it if the pod's longevity could be comparable to someone running an RDA of similar size? And I ask that more in the sense of supply cost difference. I don't ever think pods will be cheaper than making coils and replacing cotton, or buying coils and replacing cotton, but is it comparable?\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;
p385
aVIt\u2019s the only draw back. The Orion vapes great, the customer support is great if you need any help, but the pods are almost $10 a piece and the 0.25ohm pods have terrible lifespan. \u000a\u000aAfter dropping almost the full price of the device on extra pods I put it on the shelf with my Suorin drop to be used for extra portability only. \u000a\u000aIf you want a workhorse for salts that won\u2019t slowly break the bank get something like the Savour MTL RTA by vaping v1ck, or the new berserker from Vandy. If you\u2019ve never built coils it will take a day or so of learning but in the long run you will save a ton.
p386
aVLove mine so far.\u000a\u000aPods don't leak as bad as the Sourin pods
p387
aVI\u2019ve changed my mind \U0001f602\u000a\u000aWell after my first post about whether or not I should get the suorin drop, I did some research. I found a smok rolo badge, and all of the reviews I\u2019ve seen or read has ranked it higher than the suorin drop. Plus it\u2019s cheaper, and when you buy more pods they are only $3 extra and you get 3 pods instead of 1 like the suorin drop. So what are your thoughts on the two?
p388
aVThey all have similar problems, but if you get a good one, they all last about the same.  About 6 months. That's been my retail experience. \u000a\u000aPersonal, the Rolo has more airflow than the Suorin and it's easier to fill. Otherwise it's very much the same. At least to me. \u000a\u000aBut I see every pod system, in our store. They are all kinda the same to me.
p389
aVThe rolo is finicky. The dual filling causes serious issues. There is an air bubble inside the pod, like all pods, But this air bubble is special. It likes to stay on one side of the pod. Causing the wick on the opposite side to burn dry. Meaning you have to keep checking the air bubble position before hitting it. it is just a bad design. I have also had an alarming amount of funky pods for the Rolo. They cause tightness in my chest, and an awkward cough(have done experiments with same juice in a different devices/pods). I have stuck with my Sourin Air and it has been putting in work. \u005c^\u005c_\u005c^

aVThis is where you're wrong bucko! \u000a\u000aWhile you are correct, a coil that can burn salt nics can burn free base nic, the enclosure or the 'pod' usually works best with one or the other. The reason is because saltnic juice is usally 50/50 PG/VG so it is much thinner than its 70/30 counterparts. The juice is able to flow to the coils much quicker and also burns quicker. So take my Sourin Drop for example. If you were to put typical high VG juice in there you would be constantly dry hitting and wouldn't be able to inhale making for a very unpleasant experience. This is because the juice is too think to efficiently wick those tiny little MTL coils. Now if you use a rebuildable MTL tank then you shouldn't have any issues using either type of juice. 
p391
aVThey also say for \u201csalt nic only\u201d because that is going to be the best choice of juice for that particular devices kind of prodding the customer into buying the right juice for the device so they are happy with the device, which is just good business. Doesn\u2019t have to be anything nefarious. I run both salts and freebase in my Orion and suorin air. 
p392
aVI did that for a while. After using pods like the sourin and juul it really didn't feel that much harsher but definitely had more nic per hit.
p393
aVstarted with an alien and now i have a suorin drop
p394
aVThe best juice for a sourin drop (nic salt and zero nic)\u000a\u000aI have a sourin drop and I want to order some nicotine juice and some zero nic juice. I am not sure if the sourin can use zero nic, but I'm trying to cut back a little. \u000a\u000aWhat are your favorite brands and websites to use? What are your favorite flavors from said brands? 
p395
aVSure, the sourin can use 0mg nic. Nicotine content shouldn't matter at all, as long as you're using juices 70/30 vg/pg or lower.
p396
aVSo I just bought some juice, assuming the guy at the vape shop would know what kind of juice was usuable for a suorin drop, and he gave me juice with 80/20. Is this considered lower then 70/30? It smokes out of the suorin, but will it affect me or the suorin? 
p397
aVHaving tried several pod systems including both the Lost Vape Orion and the Mi-Pod, I recommend the Suorin Air v2 as the best device for the money.   \u000aIt\u2019s small and discrete yet holds 2 ml of juice and the battery is much better than expected for that size. I\u2019ve never had an issue with wicking and pods are easy to find, plus it\u2019s very affordable at $18.
p398
aVI will second this individuals opinion on the Suorin. 
p399
aVI've had two Suorin drops. I loved it and it was by far my favorite pod as far as the hit goes. Only complaint is that the battery only lasted me about 4-6 months. Like I said, I have had two so far, which for me, is a little frustrating. 
p400
aVI had the most burning pods in the MiPod. I prefer the sourin drop 
p401
aVSourin drop = bad \u000aSourin air = much better\u000a\u000aI have months of experience owning both 
p402
aVSame. I switched from Sourin to MiPod after going through 3 different sourins and getting no flavor, hit-or-miss pods, etc. Have had zero issues with MiPod and wish I switched sooner. Using Beard Vape and Fresh Pressed juices if that matters. I noticed if the PG/VG or if its not nic salts, it will overheat and taste like shit. I also noticed Solace juice burnt the cotton out really bad / made it turn black, FWIW.
p403
aVSecond this. Switched to MiPod, never turning back. Even got one for my brother for Christmas because he couldn't stop using mine (he used Smok and Sourin prior to it). \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aI think the juice has a lot to do with it too  - I have the most success with Beard's salt juice and the fresh pressed juices (and their Cali-Grown line -- the napa peach flavor is inCREDIBLE in the MiPod). And the new pods longevity/life is amazing. I get about 2-3 weeks use out of it as well as long as I fill it before it's bone-dry (I try and fill it when there's a third of juice left) and keep it upright when I'm not using it. No leaking or spit back on the new pods either. Like I said, this may be attributed to the juices as well, but FWIW. It's the only pod system to get me to stop smoking cigs entirely. \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aIn addition to this, the customer service at SV is unparalleled. I had ordered a pack of pods online that apparently were pre-update, and they weren't great. Sent them an email, 3 days later had two new packs of pods in my mailbox. 
p404
aVThat's not so bad. The other two I've had have been great (A Mi-Pod and a Sourin Drop, respectively) but randomly quit firing and I don't know why. And with those two I just had to change out the pod lol. I'm so lame, I just want one that works. I'm using MTL kits to quit smoking and when I tried with vapes before it didn't help but nicotine salts did. Now I'm on a quest to find a good one. 
p405
aVIt really sucks because I've had neither for very long. &gt;:( But I like yours and I trust you to not steer me wrong lol. I currently have 80 days smoke free. I'm currently using the Mi-Pod as a backup to the Sourin Drop but who knows how long that'll last. 
p406
aVJust from a personal standpoint I think Sourin is shit. And I know a lot of people would disagree with me on that, but I would never use their products. They just don\u2019t have a good track record when it comes to quality/performance/any other type of standard. Aspire is kind of the top dog in MTL nic salt pod game right now. At least for the price point. The Lost Vape Orion I know is an excellent system. I\u2019ve never personally owned anything from Lost Vape (mostly because I\u2019m poor lol) but I know people who have and from what I\u2019ve read they\u2019re high quality stuff. 
p407
aVYeah I'm starting to see that Sourin was not a good brand. The Lost Vape Orion looks amazing. Maybe I'll get lucky and a store here in town will sell them. We have so many here 
p408
aVThe Innokin looks good! I really like the shape, I wonder if there's any weight to it. The one thing I like about the Sourin Drop is the shape and that it's heavy. 
p409
aVAlso recommend the suorin vagon very good pod system\u000ahttps://www.greensmoking.co.il/en-gb/e-Cig-Kits/best-electronic-cigarettes/Suorin-Vagon-Starter-Kit-430mAh

aVSuggestions for Discreet devices?\u000a\u000aAny recommendations on discreet sub-ohm devices that are good for regular (non-nic-salt) e-juice?\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve enjoyed the suorin devices, but I can\u2019t stand nic-salt anymore.
p411
aVIs my Suorin Air still good to use?(pics)\u000a\u000aInitially when i bought this thing, i had alot of trouble with my draw. It was tough getting air out, so i followed some online tutorials which instructed me to take off this small plastic plating where the two connecters are. It was meant to just loosen it so i still had to put it back on and keep it there. I notice recently upon refilling my pod, that the plate wasn\u2019t there anymore. Should it still be safe to use? 
p412
aVShould I get a suorin drop?\u000a\u000aAre suorin drops a good pod system compared to juuls?
p413
aVGreat question!  I've been wondering the same.  I like the idea of buying different flavors.  It just seems a little overwhelming with the choices.  \u000aThe juul is so easy to use but the nicotine levels are so high. I'd like more choices and the sourin looks like a good option.  
p414
aVThe pods burn quick and the device can have some internal issues, check out r/Suorin and r/juul
p415
aVI've had one for about a year now and id say no. The pods burn out stupid quick so you might need 2-3 a week and I don't vape heavily. There's better pod systems out there, id say look at other Suorin systems or go for a Spryte. My friend has one and it lasts a stupid long time
p416
aVSourin iShare comes with two juul-like devices in a charger case that's kinda like pulling cigs from a pack. Juat use higher strength nic salt juice with them.
p417
aVSuorin Drop. It has a restrictive draw very close to an analog and if you get him a good tobacco flavored nic salt it should be similar enough to keep him off the cigs. Also super easy to use, no buttons or bull crap, just a charge port and it fires by taking a drag.

aVMTL RDA advice\u000a\u000aHave recently purchases a dead rabbit RDA. Love it. Building is amazing. Flavour has been such a big upgrade. Been reading and totally interested in switching to MTL. I've had suorin devices in the past and have preferred them over my mod, despite the frailty of the devices, and especially how small and easy they are to lose. I am adept at building and am willing to tackle any of the challenges that come along with. Presently I am eyeballing the berserker RDA by vandy vape as well as the VV dual box 220w squonk. I love my RDA presently but squonking seems infinitely superior to dripping. I'm comfortable with dripping a 9mg and am looking to MTL a 20-25mg nic salt. Would I be better off with the vandy vape 90W single battery squonk box? Are there better MTL squonk RDAs? Am I totally in the wrong direction here, or would berserker RDA and VV dual box 220w be an entire setup I'd be more than happy with?
p421
aVSourin Air Problems\u000a\u000aCan\u2019t find anybody else with the same problem, but my sourin air seems to literally  flame up when I hit it. Like literally looks like a flame starts in the coil when I hit it. I\u2019m about to just buy a new one but has this happened to anyone else?
p422
aVI want to get my brother something small and easy to use that he can carry in his pocket without worrying too much about leaking or anything. Something similar to a Juul or Suorin. He quit smoking so I'm looking for something that can use 0mg juice. Any suggestions?
p423
aVDefinitely. I was barely getting any flavor. I was/am new to pod systems so I have no way of saying this one is better or worse than the other... for the moment. I have tried a SUORIN VAGON and it blew the Zero out of the water but it was a different flavor. Like I said I'm trying a Panda in a few days I'll let you know how that one is. Right now I'm having doubts about a couple of things but I stick to what I've tried and said. The Zero is hot garbage.
p424
aVHow to remove taste from air suorin pods?\u000a\u000a[removed]
p425
aVYou can buy refillable pods the fit the JUUL, they are the same pods for OVNS.  All pod systems are lower powered with a very small coil, this is why they use nic salts with such a high nic content, 35mg to 50mg.  The amount of nicotine that you get per drag is pretty low as a result and not anywhere near as scary as the media would like us to think.  If you check the side bar for Anthony\u005c_Vapes recommendations he has plenty of other pod systems on there. I've had good luck with the Mi-Pod and the Suorin Air myself. I've heard really good things about the Innokin EQ also.
p426
aVI\u2019ve had a Suorin Drop and breeze for the past 9 months, but both have gotten burnt. What vape device would you guys recommend I try next? 
p427
aVNicotine levels and flavor\u000a\u000aBefore i start this post, I'm a noob when it comes to vapes and mod.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a1. Would freebase juices with 12-18mg be more harsh than nic-salts with 35-50 mg? I heard that nic-salts can be at a higher nicotine level without the harshness.\u000a2. Do different mods produce better/worse flavor? Eg: suorin air vs smok novo/ orion lost vape
p428
aVOk i'm a little bit conflicted. I currently have a suorin air and I do like the throat hit, but the flavors of the nic-salt juices that i bought are so terrible. I bought 12 and I only like 2 of them. I hear freebase juices in sub ohm tanks has more flavor but they don't have as good of a throat hit. In 2013, I bought a pink colored watermelon vape juice and it was so good. This year I bought 2-3 different nic-salt watermelon juices and they taste so nasty. Any advice?
p429
aVAre the flavor differences drastic? I also notice that my juices taste very weird when I put juice into a new suorin pod. I get a bit of a cotton flavor, but it goes away after I refill it again
p430
aVYeah I have a MTL device. I just like the sourin drop as it\u2019s easier to carry to work. So salts are what I\u2019m in the search of 
p431
aVMinifit -it\u2019s time for replacement\u000a\u000aWell I\u2019m using for the last 2 months the Minifit pod system and it helped me quite smocking but now it\u2019s time to replace it with something better and I\u2019m talking about the taste and the worm vape.\u000aSo I want to look for advise :\u000a\u000a1.

aVMy dude! Thank you for posting this!\u000aJust a few days ago I was super sick. Started with horrible stomach pain and diahrea. For 24 hours I was going to the bathroom every 30 minutes to try and relieve myself. The only thing that came out was bloody mucus.  I puked at like 5 am day two of sickness. \u000a\u000aAt day 3 it subsided and I went to the doctor. She had no idea and was happy it went away on its own and didn\u2019t do anything further... I thought it may have been from undercooked chicken. \u000a\u000aBut now I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s from nicotine my dude...\u000aI\u2019ve been using the juul and now the suorin drop, at 45-55mg nicotine....\u000a\u000aAfter I Vape I always have to poop. And I\u2019m really thinking that this high nicotine juice isn\u2019t helping my chronic stomach pain... I thought I was just lactose intolerant or had UC or IBS... \u000a\u000aI never thought that the nicotine could be causing me ulcers... 
p433
aVGlad I could help out! Those are some pretty severe symptoms. Honestly, you might want to get an endoscopy or something because those don't sound like acute symptoms...\u000a\u000aThough I'm shocked as that's exactly my setup, suorin drop at 50mg. I will definitely cut back, but my next area of concern is that I'm swallowing a non-negligible amount of juice when the damn thing sputters. LMK if you noticed that, too.
p434
aVI just got the Savour MTL from vaping v1ck so I could rebuild instead of burning through coils or pods and I love it for salts. Went from using the Suorin Drop for true MTL and Lost vape Orion for restricted lung hit to just using the Savour for everything. Runs great at low watts too so it\u2019s a battery saver.
p435
aVMTL?\u000a\u000aI realize that this question is probably asked every day but I'm desperate :(\u000a\u000aI've gone through quite a few MTL devices recently and have been pretty let down from the hit of most of them.\u000a\u000aI found the Nautilus AIO too airy, and had constant coil/pod issues with the breeze 2/suorins, and have lost countless juuls.\u000a\u000aI just want something capable of handling nic salts, that will be reliable. I don't really have the budget for an Orion atm, and have been hearing good things about the Infinix, vladdin, Novo (or the nord I guess), and renova zero. Pls help me I'll love you forever
p436
aVSuorin edge
p437
aVThe only ones that have, so far, lasted me at least a year or longer would be the RX200S and the resin Drag. Zero issues with either that would make me want to stop using them.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aI'm forgetting now when I got my current Mi-Pod, but that's lasted quite a while now, too, for a pod system. My first one crapped out pretty quickly, but the digital grey one I've been using for a while is still going strong. I also firmly believe my original Suorin Air would be working right now too if it wasn't stolen. I'd gotten it before they were so mass produced that the QC went to shit, and that thing was SO reliable. Truly a solid product when they were first released, but I wouldn't get one now, though.
p438
aVI liked the suorin &amp; Suorin drop way more than the juul, but I feel ya. I was chasing the perfect vape for a few years, and went to every end of the spectrum even spending hours on elaborate coils.  When I finally found it I developed a severe allergy to vaping though haha. :-(    Oh well.  I enjoyed it for a bit.\u000a
p439
aVOddly enough my experience with my trusty snowwolf and my valyrian tank has been way more consistent and reliable than any juul or the sourin I had. My first juul broke in a week and my second was just too inconsistent. Sometimes you will get a good hit but most of the time it leaves something to be desired. Not to mention the price of the pods if you aren't a bargain Hunter.  \u000a\u000aThe battery wears out fast on a juul and having a couple of sets of batteries that I can easily swap in and out when needed is a lot more convenient for me. Top filling my tank makes putting in juice super fast. \u000a\u000aThe biggest pro of the small juul like devices is the portability and concielment. For my uses my mod is more convenient. \u000a\u000a
p440
aVI liked the Breeze 1 a lot better than the Breeze 2. Breeze 2 looks and feels like a toy, and the hit isn\u2019t as smooth in my personal experience. If you\u2019re trying to get off cigs, I\u2019d go w/ the juul. If you want to try something new, I\u2019d go with the Smoant S8, Renova Zero, Suorin Drop/Air, Smok infinix or Novo.
p441
aVIs Smok stepping it up? I'd like to open a discussion\u000a\u000aI've not had a good experience with Smok until recently, and my opinion of them has been very low since I was suckered into buying an Alien 220w and the battery door started to degrade within two months of buying it. I generally had very good luck with Baby Beast coils but I disliked something about all of them for one reason or another; not enough airflow, too loud (Q2s holy crap, I sounded like a jet engine), bad flavour, chugged juice like a wino with a bottle of Mad Dog, etc. and so on. \u000a\u000aAfter at least a year and a half of, quite honestly, shitting on Smok based on that experience and the experiences of many people with their box mods and tanks, I picked up a Novo. To say I was impressed is kind of a weird thing to say because my expectations were so low that I would've been impressed by anything. However, I ended up really liking the thing. The draw on it is nice; coming from a Minifit the density of the clouds was something I didn't really expect; the flavour was about what I expected, Smok's usually consistent with that; the clouds are on par with the Suorin Vagon, about what I anticipated. \u000a\u000aI ended up not really speaking too highly of it because of the small battery and lack of a battery level LED, meaning it could die at any point while I was out. That was unacceptable to me. If I'm carrying a pod, pocket space is at a premium. I'm not always carrying a battery pack and if I need a second pod, why am I carrying the first one? So I've stuck it in a jacket pocket and it's sitting there in the event I forget my main pod (normally my LV Orion or OG Breeze, that beautiful bastard). A lot of people really liked it though; I've seen *tons* of people with pictures of them in their collections and my [Novo rewicking video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnukAdWN91Q) on YouTube has 50k views so it has to be popular. I mean idk, is that a lot? Then the Nord came out and I really like mine. I'm wary of Smok but my low expectations have been exceeded.\u000a\u000aSo that opens the question: is Smok's R&amp;D team behind their pods and AIOs starting to gain traction? Because if so, we can start to expect and demand a lot more out of Smok and I'm hoping they're up to the challenge. I want to like Smok; I do. They're one of the biggest players in the game right now and as pods are recommended to complete novices, they deserve to be focussed on and given a high priority regarding ease and consistency of use. \u000a\u000aI think of my husband and if he'd been given a Rolo Badge, that spat boiling drops of juice at him, leaked in his pocket and then died after 2 months; he'd have gone *straight* back to Philip Morris or Altria! And that's not what vaping should be. We as established vapers need to demand a lot more out of pod makers, especially the bigger ones in the game like Smok and Suorin, because we're fighting for who we used to be; the person trying to get away from Big Tobacco. 
p442
aVGood perspective, actually. I just feel like their pod game has been on a steadily upward trend; I've heard far less about the Novo outright dying than the Infinix and Rolo Badge for sure. I've seen the Infinix and Novo in particular in a lot of people's collections (along with the standard Suorin and Aspire stuff, the Orion's popular relative to its price as well) and far less bad about the Novo by comparison to either of those.
p443
aVPoor flavor in Suorin Drop\u000a\u000a[removed]
p444
aVCould be just a poorly made cartridge.  I've heard of bad carts from Sourin before, but it still seems a rarity.  I'm afraid I'm not much more help though.  The trouble with super simple systems like these is troubleshooting just ends up being a matter of swapping parts and seeing if anything changes.  If you've got the means, try a different cartridge and see if that makes a difference, if a friend/local shop has a battery maybe try the cartridge in their battery to see if it is a defect in the battery?  
p445
aVGet the Zenith MTL. I have many pod systems. Juul, Mipod, Suorin Air, Minifit. The tank lasts much longer on coils, it is cheaper for coils and has better flavor and throat hit. Not hating at all on pod systems (I still like them for the size factor). And some pod systems work very good (Mipod)
p446
aVA big (throwback) look at a little device: the Aspire Breeze 1\u000a\u000aHey everyone! I've been *buyin'* recently. I got a few new things that I've had long enough to think I can do a review on 'em. The Breeze is pretty well-documented at this point but there are a few notable differences between the release unit and one very small refinement Aspire has made since it was released that eliminated one of the main complaints people had with it. For the curious, I went with the OG Breeze instead of the 2 because I was attracted to the dual draw or button activation. \u000a\u000aWithout further ado, let's begin.\u000a\u000a*****\u000a\u000aVital stats:\u000a\u000a- 650mAh battery\u000a- Three coils: 0.6ohm DTL, 1.0ohm MTL and 1.2ohm MTL\u000a- Wattage range: 17-28w (0.6ohm), 10-17.5w (1.0ohm) and 8.5-14w (1.2ohm)\u000a- 2ml "pod" capacity\u000a- Draw **or** button-activated (more about the button activation in a bit, though)\u000a\u000a*****\u000a\u000aSo, to start, this thing performs pretty well as a backup device. You have to adjust your expectations a bit because this is a rather old AIO but if you can, you get a decent vape out of it. The draw activation is very nice; not as smooth as something like my Suorin Vagon or Smok Novo but it's good enough. The mouthpiece guard is sorta useless and really only good for germophobes.\u000a\u000aWhat I *really* like about this little guy is being able to use the draw activation and button in slightly different or nicely customizable ways. If I'm using a tobacco juice, it's nice to be able to start it with the draw activation and then clamp down on the button to feel like I'm squeezing a cigar. I also feel a very slight power bump when I push the button, which is so nice to have in the middle or at the end of a tobacco ejuice hit; it can make it feel way more authentic to someone coming right off cigarettes.\u000a\u000aThe clouds are good, but nothing to phone home about, especially when you take into account that the 0.6ohm coil runs at 17-28w and you've got a 650mAh battery in. I've killed the battery in this thing in under 45 minutes and the 0.6ohm coils are really the only ones that are worth anything because of the airflow design. I haven't tried the 1ohm, but the 1.2ohm provide a VERY weak hit under 60% battery.\u000a\u000aThen we get to the fill system. And it's bad. Real bad. You pretty much *have* to be at a desk or somewhere you can lay down a gross juice-covered chimney and coil because otherwise you're going to be juggling three things at once and with the glass tube that holds the juice, you don't wanna drop this thing too hard. The refinement I mentioned at the top is making the base of the unit flat so it can stand upright; why Aspire first made it curved, I have no goddamn idea. It's important to note that because it was such a big flaw, though.\u000a\u000a****\u000a\u000aAt the end of the day, the only market I can see this device really hitting home at is with people just coming off cigarettes. It's not advanced enough to satisfy hobbyists, doesn't throw great flavour, doesn't have the smoothest hit; but all of those things are fine if you're just starting. That last one is actually a plus if you're coming right off smokes!
p447
aVBeen loving my Lost Vape Orion. Running it with 30mg salts. It's one of the best salt mods I've tried so far. I've tried the Sourin Air, Sourin Drop, Sourin Vagon, Smok Rollo Badge, Breeze 2, and Joyetech Exceed Edge. They're a little pricey compared to everything else but worth it.
p448
aVMy Sourin Air has been rather consistent. Longest lasting pod out the various devices I have tried. Virtually no spiting, but every few pods will leak out of the bottom. Does not seem to get into the device and is such a small amount of juice its easy to clean up. Every single nic salt device I have tried has its own set of issues. So its a matter of what problems your willing to deal with. Or go to a more expensive device that can work with nic salt. 
p449
aVSo, with nicotine salts. even if it says 30-60mg nicotine, it\u2019s not going to be as harsh as you think it would. For example, if you vaped 12mg freebase vs 55mg nic salts, typically the freebase will be more harsh. Nicotine salts are just smoother vapes. Similarly, 3mg nicotine = smoother than 3mg freebase. Keep in mind, though, that nic salts can buzz the fuck out of you if you\u2019re not used to them. Moving on, nic salts have more of a \u201csharp,\u201d cigarette-like draw, while high freebase is obviously more \u201cscratchy.\u201d \u000a\u000anicotine salts are most popular done through:\u000a\u000aclosed systems - which are non-refillable vapes that you must pre-filled pods for such as the Juul, Phix, and Kilo 1k. In essence, much of these devices mimic a cigarette. Thus, they\u2019re the most convenient option, but also arguably the most expensive. (Bout 20-25 bucks for 4 pack of pods usually). \u000a\u000aRefillable systems: These are pretty much what it says. That is, a vape in which you can buy EMPTY pods for, and you refill them with whatever nicotine salt juice you like (optimum hit at 30-50mg depending on your preference). Typically, you get about 5-10 refills before the pod goes bad, then you get more. I want to point out that there\u2019s also refillable nicotine salt devices that use coils, as opposed to pods. Same exact principle, though. So if you want a pod mod some good ones are: renova zero, smoant s8, Smok infinix and Novo, Suorin Drop/Air. For coil refillable: Breeze 1, 2, and nautilus are pretty popular. You can also subohm with innokin zenith thank.\u000a\u000aJust do research on a few nicotine salt devices, and see which ones you think you\u2019ll like. I personally use the Smoant s8 for nic salt because it\u2019s reliable af.

aVYup. I have a suorin air and and a lostvape Orion now that I use at my desk, and a box mod for at home, and it\u2019s been a great combo for me to quit cigs

aVI got the kit with the SKRR tank but I haven't really used it yet. I'm still working my learning curve through the various kits I've collected. I started with a Switz2 Basic kit from Totally Wicked and 18mgml free base liquid but it quickly proved ineffective at replacing cigarettes so I switched to a Breeze 2 and started using 50 mg/ml salts. I wanted to have more power however so I ordered a Vaporesso Armour Pro kit and the aforementioned Luxe kit both from the same web store. I am currently using the Armour Pro and the Breeze 2. I've also ordered an Innokin Zenith MTL tank and a Freemax Mesh Pro tank, as those are currently considered the best in their respective classes (low-medium MTL vaping and medium to high DTL vaping) but haven't been delivered yet.\u000a\u000aThe reason I haven't tried the Luxe is trifold.\u000a\u000aFirstly I don't have batteries for it. I'm currently using some Aspire 2600 batteries from the local B&amp;M - they're not really recommended and because the Luxe kit works best at 60 to 110W, I don't want to ramp up higher than 45W on these batteries. They also should be a married pair and the ones I have rotate in the Armour Pro. \u000a\u000aSecondly, my juices are 50mg/ml nic salts and 18 mg/ml freebase - it would be a really bad idea to pop any of those into a subohm and ramp to the suggested 80watt or more.\u000a\u000aThirdly, still trying to learn to DTL without going into a coughing frenzy.\u000a\u000a\u000aSo basically my plan was - start with Breeze 2, move to Armour Pro at upto 45W, then try 55W to 80W in the Luxe when I've gotten better at tolerating the throat hit, have new batteries and juice.\u000a\u000a\u000aI have no idea what's right for your mum but I think if she's never Vaped before, a pod mod like the Breeze 2, Suorin Air or Lost Vape Orion with nic salts would be both easier to use, and gentler on her throat than an 80watt DTL hit but that's just my experience.\u000a\u000aThe Freemax Mesh Pro coils come with lower power options like 50W and 60W. So eventually I'll have some more options and tanks to play with once all my orders are delivered.\u000a\u000aI think according to the Mooch table, I'd like to get some more nice batteries for higher watt attempts - Samsung 30T or 40T for my Armour Pro, a couple of the Sonys for Luxe kit.

aVI have been spending 40 dollars a week on juul pods, what are some cheaper alternatives?\u000a\u000aAs you can see by the title I am done wasting so much money on juul pods and want to switch up my vape. What are some good vapes you guys could recommend, right now I am looking at the sourin air. And do they make juice that does not have diacetyl?
p453
aVSourin air is refillable I believe
p454
aVI was referring to the question about diacetyl, you can choose whatever juice you want with the suorin air!
p455
aVSuorin air. Innokin EQ. 
p456
aVOk, a bit of further research suggests the Smok Alien has this feature, although it's tendency to self-immolate means it's the last thing I'd want to chuck in a handbag. My Yihi MX offers the feature to change my standby time, but it only seems to turn the screen off but not lock it. I know one of the Teslas - I think it's the 120 - has a physical on/off switch, but again, she'd need to remember to do it. What kit is it she's using just now mate? If it's just a little pen, might be worth switching to one of the little draw activated pod systems like the Breeze 1 or one of the Suorins - that way it can't fire unless someone's sucking on it. 
p457
aVIf OP's going to go with something they have to refill, they'd be better off with a different pod system entirely. While the Juul isn't really all that hard to fill it's still messy and a little finicky.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately there aren't a ton of other options in the cigalike form factor. Anything that's worth anything is either much bigger or much heavier (relatively speaking; they're not huge). The Vladdin RE is apparently decent, and while I haven't really heard *anything* about the Suorin iShare it seems to have gotten good reviews. The iShare has a "pack" with two removable "cigarettes" and magnetic contacts to both charge the "cigs" and hold them in place. The flavour probably won't be as good as another pod system but you may like it more than your MarkTens.
p458
aVI have a Pico 25 = Zenith for MTL.\u000aAs for pods, I carry a Juul, Minifit, Mipod, Suorin Air and use them equally at home. \u000aThe Sourin Air for me is the best MTL pod, kinda weird since it's the cheapest but the hits are really good. \u000aThe Mipod has great DTL.\u000aI Still think the best throat hit and flavor comes from the Zenith tank, but it's hard to carry around a box mod.\u000aAnd I use 50mg nic salts (Solace) mango and dragonfruit all the time. Best way to mimic the Juul flavors.
p459
aVAs of right now the only fully rebuildable pod I have is the Minifit. You can rebuild a few others (the Smok Novo and Suorin Vagon are the ones I have) that you can rebuild, but only if you're alright with reduced performance. All three of those are easily rewickable. \u000a\u000aIf you want one you can rewick and/or rebuild the #1 way to tell is if they're vertical or horizontal coil. I've tried exactly one vertical coil system (the Vapeccino MATE1) and it ended in tears. One was enough.
p460
aVMy daily vapes are all pods--I have a MiPod for home/social gatherings/being out and about and a Suorin Air that comes to work with me--the gunmetal one blends in with everything on my desk and is a great little stealth vape. These keep me from smoking real cigarettes and I use tobacco flavored salts exclusively in them. Dessert and fruit flavors don't seem to taste right with salts to me, but maybe I was burned so bad by the one I tried that I'm giving up prematurely on them.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aI also use a sub-ohm mod for non-tobacco flavors, usually in the evenings. It's leaky and I have to be in the mood for DL hits though so my eLeaf Basal MTL mod sees a lot more mileage than it does. I still don't bring the Basal out with me much even though it's a small mod.
p461
aVZero for sure. We don't carry any Smok products anymore aside from the baby beast and big baby beast tank just because a lot of newer folks have heard about them and only want that but even then most end up using vaporesso GT core coils in their baby beast because Smok coils have such a high failure rate.\u000a\u000aI was the guinea pig for the zero at my shop when they first released. We brought them in as replacements to the suorin air and drop because they started coming back quite frequently as faulty. Between the adjustable wattage, TC, leak resistant pod design, great flavor, among other things, the Zero is hands down one of my favorite ultra portable pod systems. Our customers love them as well. We've sold A LOT and only had 3 come back so far with issues. \u000a\u000aIf you're interested in a pod system that uses coils rather than disposable pods, we've also had great success with the breeze 2.
p462
aVLooking for a new setup\u000a\u000aHey everyone of r/Electronic_Cigarette, currently I\u2019m using a Greek Aegis with a vaporesso cascade and 4 coil 200 ohm coils at home. At work i like more subtlety so i use the Sourin Drop pod device. I\u2019m wondering if there is an inbetween that anyone could recommend. Something that hits similar to a vape but is more compact and portable like a pod system. I\u2019m asking here because I prefer personal reviews from actual end users. Thanks in advance!
p463
aVSwitched to pod systems exclusively.  Tried quite a few, suorin drop is my favorite.
p464
aVAre there any confirmed dangerous health effects of vaping?\u000a\u000aI've been vaping since I was 15, cuz I was a dumb teenager. However I am 18 and want to quit soon. I am pretty sure that  vaping has very little known health effects at the moment, but I never smoked and it seems pointless to vape now, even though I am addicted to nicotine. Are there any confirmed dangerous health effects with vaping? \u000a\u000aAlong with this, what is a good way to quit vaping? I am using 25 nic in a suorin drop but my next juice is 15, and I'm trying to stop after that. I know it's best to quit cold turkey, but most of my friends vape so it might be difficult for me. I was thinking of using nicotine gum at low strengths just to curb the cravings. What do you guys think? All help is appreciated. Thanks!
p465
aVPretty sure I'm going to have to grab one of these. I've been wondering why someone didn't make something almost exactly like this, for at least 6 months now.\u000a\u000aNow if there was an AIO version. Like a Suorin Air, but palm sized. That would be perfection.
p466
aVNot sure if this is the correct sub. But had a quick question about the Smok Novo, battery life.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m not sure if this is the correct sub. Question about Smok Novo, about how long they last. I use about 1 cartridge every 1 and a 1/2 to 2 weeks.. Was going to invest in a bunch of cartridges since I found some for sale on this site, but don\u2019t want to invest unless I know it\u2019ll last me awhile which my suorin air did not and I have unused cartridges. Any help would be appreciated. Ty
p467
aVWell, the reason I wanted to order a few in advance is bcus it\u2019s on sale, and takes about 2 weeks to come in. My local vape shop doesn\u2019t carry them, even if they did they would be overpriced. I only spent $17.99 on the device and I\u2019m just hoping it\u2019ll last more than 5-6 months, bcus my suorin air lasted me 6, which is actually longer than expected bcus I\u2019ve read reviews where some ppl had their crap out on them within 1-2 months at most. Maybe I\u2019ll just buy 3x 3 packs since they are around $5 for a 3-Pack w/ free shipping. I almost went with the Vagon, but that is made by suorin so I decided to go with the novo. I used to use sub-ohm devices both mechanical and digital devices. I just got tired of tanks, RDA\u2019s, RTA\u2019s, and the whole priceyness of them. Even though salt-nic pod style systems don\u2019t provide as much flavor and smoke production those are what I am into for right now, due to funds, and the simplicity of pod systems I couldn\u2019t go wrong.. 
p468
aVI\u2019m one of those people that have had nothing but a great experience with the Novo. I\u2019ve had them (I have multiple bc color choices lol) for 6months. So, my personal opinion, I\u2019d highly recommend buying into the extra pods. I had the Suorin Air and hated it bc the pods didn\u2019t hold up and got tired of dry hits and burnt out coils/pods after 3 day use. 
p469
aVThe suorin air was okay as an introductory pod system, but you are right. Burnt hits, leaks, and it would auto-Fire on me. I didn\u2019t like the on-off switch they implemented. I think that\u2019s why it would auto-Fire or maybe the leaking. I\u2019m hoping that the novo last me longer than the air. Any suggestions for a longer lasting pod system that isn\u2019t too expensive? Around the $40 range? 
p470
aVSweet! I\u2019ve never used 70/30 vg blends bcus the vape store I go to almost told me to use strictly salt-nics Cus it\u2019s a pod system, or it might be due to owning a suorin air at the time. Does the 6mg hit like a 50mg salt-nic? I\u2019m very curious of this Cus they don\u2019t carry a variety of salt nic flavors. I really like mod milk, was gonna try lava flow by naked. Or anything that taste like strawberry milk.. I love those type of flavors.
p471
aVSome pod systems like the Suorin Air can not handle wicking anything over 50/50. The Novo does not have that issue. Here\u2019s how I think about freebase vs nic salts...nic salts are like Bam! in your face. It only takes a hit or two and then you walk away from it for 30minutes, kinda like how you would smoke a traditional cigarette. It hits your bloodstream fast, but mellows out and doesn\u2019t linger. Where freebase takes longer to absorb into the blood then gets mellow and chills for awhile. So you can vape more throughout the day. So, personally, no....6mg doesn\u2019t hit like 50mg nic salts. I like the act and feel of vaping so freebase is more my style. I quit smoking almost 4yrs ago and do not have that habit/need to take a hit and walk away for 30minutes. Like I said before, though I used 3mg in rdas and subohming, it wasn\u2019t enough to satisfy my nic craving in a pod, but the 6mg is perfect. I\u2019m a big Strawberry fan myself and absolutely love Naked Lava Flow!! Another fav is the brand Pacha Mama. 
p472
aVHelp! Need to find new pod system.\u000a\u000aI've had a Sourin Drop and now a SMOK Novo. Love the designs of smokes products but as we all know they suck. My first Novo started autofiring (just as my Sourin did) and I replaced it. This new Novo has stopped charging after about a week. Yes I keep it clean and check to make sure it is clean multiple times a day. \u000a\u000aI want to stop buying pod systems all the damn time! I have done a little research. Anyone know anything about the JUSTFOG minifit? Or anything that won't crap out on me in a couple of months? I prefer small enough to fit in the little coin pocket on my jeans. \u000a\u000aPLEASE HELP!
p473

aVOrion Lost vape questions\u000a\u000aFirst of all, just saying that I am not an expert and to please be patient with my stupidity. I just got off the suorin air, and had leftover 50mg I heart salts vape juice. I have been told by many people to get this one pod system because of how long the pods last for. I caved and bought it. But my coil is already burnt after about 2 days of use. Please help. Is it my juice or my output in power to the device itself? it is a .25 ohm pod. 
p476
aVHonestly the Suorin Air was a better performer with high nic salts than the Orion. And that thing is a turd and a half, at least when it comes to reliability and build quality. But they do provide a good vape when they work.\u000a\u000aIf I had to choose a pod system? Probably the Artery Pal Mini or Aspire Breeze (not the 2). But I'm currently using a Nautilus 2 on a ehpro mod101. Cost, about $40 and is better in every way than my Orion was. Except for the aesthetics \U0001f615\u000a\u000aI have been saying it for months, and I really hope LV will release one, but they need a 1.2-1.8ohm pod. I will buy another Orion if that ever happens.
p477
aVI **love** my Orion; but I can't disagree. LV needs to do some fine-tuning on their pods and their wicking process especially. They still last me way longer than literally any other pod I've tried and taste way better, but I'd like to get more than 3-4 days out of one. \u000a\u000aFor reference, I vape very heavily and can kill any other pod system in under 12 hours. I have the Smok Novo, Suorin Vagon, Vapeccino MATE1 and a couple Minifits and none of them has ever lasted more than 2 days even when I was heavily using all of them at once. If I couldn't rewick them I would never have got as into them as I am.

aVSuorin Air extremely sensitive and making a loud crackle noise after hitting\u000a\u000aHey guys,\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aI have had my Suorin air now for about 4 months, and all of a sudden I have noticed that this device is extremely sensitive when hitting. I'll hit it for a split seconds, and it makes a loud crackle noise similar to pop and rocks. Is this something serious? Or normal? Might be time for me to get a new device...

p480
aVIf your wife is good with computers and such, the Lost Vape Orion is the best pod currently out. You don't exactly *have* to use the PC companion software but it's good to if you want to get the most out of it. It's not really comparable to a regular pod; you get a lot more fills out of the pods and it seems to be a lot more efficient on juice, though I could be imagining that. It has the best flavour out of any pod I've tried. You can also adjust the wattage and a few other things with the PC companion software and it has a very handy feature called Replay. You basically take a hit, decide it was a good one, hold a button down and the pod will "replay" that hit every time using a very complicated set of algorithms to detect performance across the metal part of the coil. \u000a\u000aAs for a more simple pod device, the Suorin Vagon is quite comparable to the Smok Novo in terms of the flavour and cloud production. It's also draw-activated, so you just inhale through the mouthpiece to fire it. The vapour density may be a bit much for her at first if she's never tried vaping before but she'll adapt to it after some coughing; everyone coughs at first. She'll be going from inhaling dry smoke to wet vapour; the throat and lungs have to adapt to that.
p481
aVSuorin air. 
p482
aVI've tried a number of pod systems, my top two so far are the Mi Pod and the Nautilus AIO.  I lean more towards the Mi Pod due to the automatic switch, and the simpler construction.  Next on my list to try are the Innokin EQ and the OVNS JCO1 (although the OVNS will be my first Juul compatible system).  I've tried the Baton v.1, Justfog Minifit, Sourin Drop, and Ego AIO Eco (not really a pod system, but made for nic salts).  
p483
aVHi there! No I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done that, I learnt my lesson the hard way with a Suorin air a couple of months ago. I\u2019ve never experienced this before either, and I have 3 other S8s between our family. 
p484
aVIm vaping 35mg on a Rolo Badge, and a Sourin Air. Find it smooth AF. Quite flavorful as well. I do however find inconsistency in the pods themselves. Some wont wick, others leak like crazy, etc etc. So before you write off the device, try a new pod. 
p485
aVSourin Air has never leaked for me. I honestly think it is one of the best refillable pod systems.
p486
aVOnly issue I\u2019ve ran into with the suorin air is over firing. As a group of 7 friends only two of us owned one so we passed it around to all the other nicotine fiends so there was a lot of chain vaping and probably pulling way too hard. 
p487
aVOut of the countless pod systems i've used the only ones i'd deem reliable are the innoken eq and the juul, suorin products have horrible quality control i'd suggest avoiding them. 
p488
aVMine ended up leaking bad and killing the draw detection, I rewired it to fire when switched on and it still works but I need new pods and juice, ended up getting a cheap myblu kit that uses nic salts now and I'm vaping honey and milk. The sourin was good until it killed itself, then it was good when I yanked it from the dead. Now it's sliding back into it's grave but that's alright.
p489
aVI have not used to many devices, but my Sourin Air has been put the ringer. Only issue is the previously mentioned leaking around the base of the cart. Its minor, and varies from cart to cart. A buddy dropped one in the river, and after drying it out it still worked! The water soaked cart too!! After a few days it would take a really big draw to function. But it is a testament to build quality. Had a Smok Infinx... at about 80 degrees it leaked the entire cart into the device overnight...

aVbest mango nic-salt juice for a heavy hitter?\u000a\u000aReddit search is being an ass right now but I'm a dedicated Juul-fiend atm with a vaping background that goes back to 2009 and e-cigarette-forum.com starting with the original NJOYs moving into Radio Shack box mods, then the OG Provari, and SMOK devices like the Mag 250W. \u000a\u000aI'm buying a Suorin Air (unless someone chimes in with a better idea for a stealthy automatic battery device) and want something similar to Juul's Mango but am open to brighter flavors and don't mind a milder throat hit for frequent use since the Juul tears my throat up (I'm a 2.5 pods / day sober living RC junkie in the early white knuckle phase) and has me coughing up phlegm like an analog smoker.\u000a\u000aThanks!

aVHaving trouble picking\u000a\u000aOk so I currently have a suorin air and i have a lot of problems with the pods ending up tasting terrible after just a couple of days of use. I make sure to let the coil saturate and wait in between hits, but nothing seems to work. I was wondering if anyone would recommend that I switch to an aspire breeze. I've heard that the quality of the coils are a lot better than the airs and im really just wanting something thats cheap to maintain and reliable. 
p495
aVI just replaced my Suorin Air with a Innokin EQ  on 12/6 and have been using it almost exclusively since.  I like it so far, monumentally better than the Suorin.
p496
aVMI-POD or SMOK NOVO?\u000a\u000aI heard good things about both devices but I can't seem to pick and choose which to buy.\u000a\u000aI like airy hits and I've only used the juul and suorin air when it comes to vaping. The suorin air hits too harsh for me and I feel like the carts would burn too fast. \u000a\u000aI've tried my friends bigger mods before, I think it's SMOK not too sure but the big ass ones if you know what I mean haha and I love the airy like, smooth hits and I was wondering if either the mipod or the novo would give me anything similar to that.\u000a\u000a(If you like to recommend me other small-vape devices that would be cool too!)\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aThanks guys! :)

aVWhen you say air bubbles galore are you just talking about bubbles coming off of the wick? Because if so it\u2019s just absorbing juice better and should help with the longevity of the pod/coil\u000a\u000aPersonally I have used a juul in the past. Wasn\u2019t a fan. Tried a smok infinix (was 8 bucks so I figured why not) wasn\u2019t a fan of that either. Now I\u2019ve got a suorin air for when I\u2019m out and about, and an rda squonk combo for when I\u2019m home. I\u2019ve gone through loads of mods/tanks/atomizers before I found the setup that worked for me. \u000a\u000aDon\u2019t give up, your dream set up is somewhere out there and once you find what you like you\u2019ll be insanely happy\u000a\u000aWelcome and keep on vaping! 
p498
aVI spent about 18 bucks for a suorin air and 3 pods run me 12 bucks at the shop. I have heard of people having issues with theirs, but it\u2019s been solid for 6 months for me. Even if I did crap out on me it was less than 20, and it\u2019s super slim and lightweight. I haven\u2019t run into any bad pods yet, and get decent flavor out of ndk100 brain freeze and very cool. \u000a\u000aMy squonk is what I use at home because it offers better flavor and is more my preference, but the pod system with nic salt is perfect for taking out or while I\u2019m at work. \u000a\u000aAnd yeah it\u2019s a rabbit hole. You start off with one device, and keep adding to your collection, but the way I look at it is if it keeps me off of going back to cigarettes it\u2019s worth it. \u000a\u000aWhat you\u2019re describing with the air bubbles seems somewhat normal, but if the pods are only lasting for 2 refills something is off. I see air bubbles on my wick in my air all the time. Sometimes I take the pod out and open the juice port to correct slight \u201cvapor lock\u201d issues, and a rather big bubble comes out and I get a more flavorful hit. Bubbles just mean juice is being vaporized and more is being wicked, it\u2019s nothing to worry about and happens with every kind of tank/pod system I have ever used. 
p499
aVI use a suorin drop now, but I dripped for a couple of years and used sub-ohm tanks for a while.\u000a\u000aWhen I'm at a party sometimes I'll hit someone's box mod. They're always impressed when I hit it correctly and don't cough lol.

aVPen Pal vs Suorin Air: Pen sleek, or Wallet sleek?\u000a\u000a[removed]
p501
aVI\u2019m 23 (and if I was minor I would say I was major anyways am I right ) . You\u2019ll have to excuse me for my poor choice of words,  it\u2019s not that I want to hide anything , just want it to be a sleek and modern vape. It\u2019s always just kinda seemed cool to have a pen that\u2019s also a vape that\u2019s easy to store. Cool thing about the Suorin is that I can place it in my pocket. But then again the Pen Pal is just completely badass. But if that means that I\u2019ll get a much worse experience, then no I won\u2019t get the pen. 
p502
aVIf I use the suorin air, and only do a few pulls a day (0mg PG/VG 7:3), how long would the refillable pod last?
p503
aVThe pod itself or the juice in it? The juice would likely last you a few days to a week at the very least. I can\u2019t speak of the pod life or how many fills it would last as I don\u2019t have the sourin air.

aVVery cool giveaway, thank you guys for doing this for us! My buddies mom is in between vaping and cigarettes and having trouble fully switching with a suorin drop and salt nic. Just had a conversation with her about how a bigger mod and sub ohm worked better for myself. This would be a very cool Christmas gift for her. 
p505
aVI'm not sure if this is good advice, but I have seen a lot of smokers liking pod systems with nic salt, as it's more closer to the real thing. For that I recommend a sourin air.\u000a\u000aFor mods, you can't go wrong with anything by vapresso, but try to get a fireluke mesh tank, it's got pretty good flavor, and awesome clouds.\u000a\u000a-cheers

aVNice design.  I am looking for something to replace my Suorin Air when on the go.  The ceramic coil is interesting to me.., also liking the 550mAh battery and button free system.
p508
aVSo far it looks phenomenal. Im a huge car guy so I love the "tail lights" on the system. Also the fact that there's no cotton is amazing. I HATE the taste of burnt cotton. And the quick charge feature is freaking awesome. I have a very busy schedule and don't have time to charge my vape when it's needed and end up with a dead mod all the time. If I could get this mod that would be awesome. I just got ripped off by Eight Vape sending me a broken Suorin Air and they won't contact me. $50 worth of pods and a mod down the drain. So if I actually one this I would be so stoked.

aVProblems with Smok Novo/ Suorin Air/ Smok Infinix\u000a\u000aIn order :\u000a\u000aMy Novo collects air bubbles which start burning the cotton\u000a\u000aMy suorin pod burned after three days \u000a\u000aInfinix is my favorite all around, but my pods will taste disgusting but the pod doesn't look burnt.\u000a\u000ais there any way to fix these problems? trying to figure out if i keep getting dealt a bad hand or if i just take shitty care of vapes\u000a\u000ap.s. all vapes were primed before using \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;
p511
aVWell ive only had my infinix but only issue i have is occasional spitting.  havent had to change pods often maybe you got bad ones?  my friends suorin tastes the same
p512
aVYou don't really want to go any higher than 70VG/30PG in most pod systems, due to wicking issues with thicker liquid. I've found that 50/50s and 60/40s work the best, in my experience.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aJust to note, though, with the exception of Suorin's Air, I've not had one pod system to date that didn't give *some* spitback. Obviously, it shouldn't just dump out everywhere, but a little spitback every now and then is completely within the norm.
p513
aVWowww...I wish I would've checked. I got 5 bottles of juice 5 refill pods and a broken Suorin Air for $63 and now all I have is useless shit 
p514
aVI\u2019ve got a suorin air(pods &amp; about as big as a few credit cards stacked) that hasn\u2019t failed me yet and it\u2019s great with salts, but battery life isn\u2019t as long as I\u2019d like. If I\u2019m really on it, it\u2019s dead in ~4hours. It\u2019s also old tho so might be part of the battery life issue.  
p515
aVI've had a Suorin Air and currently use the Drop for my salts. \u000a\u000aFunctionally the Drop and Air are the same. I think the juice capacity is slightly higher on the Air, but not meaningfully so. I had some issues with auto-firing and coil wicking with the Air - I think Suorin sorted most of their problems out with the Drop.\u000a\u000aI will be frank though - there's a reason why Juul caught so much market share so quickly. For the uninitiated smoker who doesn't want to fiddle, it just plain works. Even though you and I know the obvious advantages of superior products (value, better flavor, better economics) I've found that, especially when someone like your mom is just starting out, just give her something that works. No mess, no hassle. If she can stick to the Juul, it won't be long before she's hitting you up for something better. :)
p516
aVSharing my thoughts on the Aspire Breeze 2.\u000a\u000aNot gonna lie for the first few weeks I really regretted buying the device. I was rocking the suorin air for a while, but after the third device I gave up on it. Still think it's an awesome device just shitty quality, they don't last too long regardless how well you take care of it.\u000a\u000aAnyways, I bought this guy because it was highly recommended. The first 1.0 coil, lasted me like 3-4 days before it got "flooded" i was getting nasty spit back overall inconsistent draws. The 0.6 lasted a bit longer than that, but I had the same problems.\u000a\u000aToday I finally received the 1.0 coils in mail, and this thing is hitting like a dream! I closed off the air flow I'm rocking nic salts with it. The only different thing I did was I didn't drop juice in the cotton before I put in the pod. I just put the coil in dry, and let it sit for 15 minutes, and no flooding or inconsistent draws!\u000a\u000aI now see why it was highly praised, I'm very satisfied with it now. I just wanted to post this, so if anyone is having issues with theirs to try this. \u000a\u000aIf anyone has any more tips on this device I'll be glad to hear em, happy vaping guys. \u000a

aVSuorin Air Pod Really Hard to Pull\u000a\u000aI have a couple of pods, which most of them I can pull lightly and the vapor would come out. But one of the pods are really hard to pull and produces very little vapor unless I pull very hard. \u000a\u000aThere is nothing wrong with any burnt tastes or anything and I've tried priming it but no change in the airflow.\u000a\u000aAnyone know why it's happening and is there a way to fix this?

aVHelp with Suorin Air\u000a\u000aHello,\u000a\u000aI recently bought a Suorin Air last week, however it completely stopped hitting yesterday. When I took it apart to clean it, I noticed that one of the contact pins was stuck lower. Does anyone have tips to keep the pin up? Thanks 
p519
aVNeed help in buying a mod\u000a\u000aHey guys so I have been vaping for a year and a half now, pretty much entirely on the Sourin Air. I just found out that the nic I'm using (50mg) is messing with my sleep. I'm looking to slowly ease off on it and move to a mod so i can vape less nic. I've looked in the guides on the sidebar but I'm not too sure what to get, I'm looking at the Aspyr Zelos, and my budget isn't restricted. It would also be nice if I could be guided to a trustworthy site with low shipping costs. Thanks in advance!

aVBest small nic salt device: eGO aio ECO, or iCare/iCare mini, suorin drop.\u000a\u000aHello fellow vapers,\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aI am currently looking for a new ultra portable device that can fill my needs.  I've dealt with RTA's before with a box mod but I'm looking for very small device for on the go.  Currently I use a Juno (that I surprisingly enjoy in 36mg) and sometimes Juuls, and I have a broken ego aio that I'm trying to replace.  I love the design and aesthetic of the iCare and the mini but I am really interested in the eGO aio ECO by joyetech because it is small and they claim its optimized for nic salts.   \u000a\u000aPlease feel free to respond with any feedback you have with the devices.

aV60 mg juice, no buzz??\u000a\u000aI bought 60 mg of salt nerds grape soda to come with my mi-pod, and i cant say ive buzzed as hard as I do using 50mg juice with my suorin air.\u000a\u000aCould I have gotten some bunk juice? I\u2019ve never had this problem and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the mi-pod or the juice. I put the same juice in my Suorin Air and it still gives me a throat hit while the mi pod does not.
p522
aVI upgraded, but my flavor downgraded\u000a\u000aI\u2019ll start with a brief overview to set the scene. I started vaping with a JUUL just to see if I liked it. I did, and so I bought some Blue Dot Vapor ejuice so that I could get some variety in life. That worked out well, so I moved on to the Sourin Vagon. That was fine, and the taste with both vapes was good, but I wanted to get an actual mod.\u000a\u000aThis week my Lost Vape Mirage, Samsung 40Ts, and Horizontech Falcon arrived (I\u2019ve tried to be as informed with my purschses as possible and have chosen all my supplies based off of reviews on this sub). I charged my batteries to full using a Xtar VC4. I decided to go with Convicted Mellons for my first fill of the tank since it has been one of the most mutally agreeable flavors for me and my SO. I primed the Falcon tank based off of any instruction on priming the tank that I could find. I screwed the tank into the Mirage and it read 0.16 ohm, even though the cool is 0.15 ohm. I adjusted this in the atomizer menu so that it was correct.\u000a\u000aI tried hits at 10 - 50 watts at each of the 5 watt increments and every hit tastes like I\u2019m vaping lavender hand soap. I\u2019m getting very strong floral and chemical notes, with zero fruit. It is extremely unpleasant. I had my SO try it and she hated it. The chemical/floral taste burns/tingles your throat of you take a big hit.\u000a\u000aI don\u2019t understand what is happening, and could really use some help. This particular batch of Convicted Mellons was born 11/2 and has been used for several fills in a JUUL and Sourin Vagon since. Why is it tasting so bad in the Mirage? I must be doing something wrong.
p523
aVYeah, I\u2019ve been letting the bottle steep since 11/5 or so. It\u2019s been tasting great in my low power vapes (JUUL and Sourin Vagon)

aVSuorin Air Over(?)firing\u000a\u000a Hi all, this is my first time posting here and would love to get y'alls input on my Suorin Air.\u000a\u000aA couple of days ago, I noticed that my Suorin Air wasn't firing as much and, even if I do long drags, I get significantly less smoke than what I was used to (I've owned this Suorin Air for about two full months now). After being disheartened, I watched a couple of videos about cleaning my Suorin and, after a few q-tips and paper towels, I finally got it to work normally again.\u000a\u000aHere's where it gets frustrating... After a couple of days of such great Suorin experience, I notice that it overfires for a good five to six seconds. I'm wondering if this is normal? Is there a fix for this? Am I in danger if I keep using it in this state?\u000a\u000aAny replies would be appreciated. Love the Suorin still though! Helped me quit smoking after 14-15 years!
p525
aVI am currently on my 3rd Suorin Air.  The past 2 started overfiring after about 4 months of use.  I suspect this one will start over firing as well eventually.  When that happens I'm switching to the Innokin EQ.  \u000a\u000aI would always turn the switch to 'OFF'" after taking a drag to prevent continuous firing.  I don't think it's a safety issue per say, but that extra firing after it leaves your lips will burn out the cotton faster.  I would suggest replacing it, and turning it off after taking a drag in the interim.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aLike most chinese companies, Suorin products are cheaply made in bulk with little quality assurance.  Their customer service is crap as well.., they truly don't care (because they are still making a nice profit.)
p526
aVThanks for your reply. I actually thought it might be a safety concern since it was the first time it did it... Suorin is a Chinese brand? I thought it was Korean! :( It's such a nice product but you're right, if this happened on my almsot 3rd month of use then yeah their QA sucks. But then again, you get the $20 you paid for I guess...

aVSwitched from Suorin Drop to Aspire Nautilus AIO. Why do my NicSalts taste like plastic now??\u000a\u000aI just picked up an Aspire Nautilus AIO because I got tired of the short lifespan of Suorin Drops. I use 50mg NicSalts. I set it up using the green coil meant for nicsalt and it tasted horrible! I thought it was the juice so I emptied it out and filled it with another and let it sit for a ten minutes. Surprisingly, I got the same horrible plastic taste!\u000aPlease tell me how this can be resolved.

aVHow to quit "nicotine salts" as a college student with a stressful workload?\u000a\u000aReason for saying "nicotine salts" is because that is what I have first started smoking. I've had the juul, sourin, breeze, you name it and it is time to stop. After being around people who have them, I had to get one myself. I love the morning hit and any hits after that. But my wallet does not love it. I am sick of the chemical taste that these juices give me and the constant spitting in my mouth.  I am prescribed adderall and adderall and nicotine are like best friends together, which is not helping. I am thinking about quitting cold turkey this weekend, but am scared of the side effects. I have finals in 2 weeks. Will I be shaky? Will I not focus on school work? Should I wait till after finals? Will all I think about is nicotine when I'm studying? If anyone has any information or experiences please let me know!

aVBetter than Sourin Air?\u000a\u000aHi,\u000aHad Sourin Air for 2 months, worked really well at first but now having problems with draws,leds and switches and whatnot.

aVNew mod, bad throat burn\u000a\u000aI haven't been vaping for too long, I started with a Suorin Drop which produced very little throat burn, then upgraded to a Vaporesso Revenger X which gave some throat burn but I gradually got used to it. \u000a\u000aAll my juices are 3mg nic and some are 70vg/30pg and some are 50/50. I've never noticed a difference in the amount of burn when using higher pg.\u000a\u000aNow I just got a Uwell Nunchaku and some Reds Apple ejuice which is also 3mg nic and 70vg/30pg and every hit makes my throat feel like it's on fire, coughing like crazy, and I'm getting barely any flavor. Airflow is completely open and I've tried lowering the watts with no luck.\u000a\u000aI always make sure to prime my coils and let them sit for 10 or more minutes. Nothing *tastes* burnt, I can just feel it. What am I doing wrong?

aVDTL to MTL nicotine strength\u000a\u000aHey guys, I'm thinking about picking up an MTL atty to try out since I've exclusively vaped DTL since I started. I've had some experience with my friends pod systems (juul and Sourin drop) and I enjoyed the tight draw and high nicotine. For anyone who's made a similar transition, how much did you raise your nicotine levels? I DTL 3mg freebase or 6mg nic salts. I'm thinking of jumping to 12mg Salts but I don't know if that will have the same throat hit as those pod devices.

aVLooking for a pod system with a similar hit as a sourin drop\u000a\u000aI absolutely love the way my drop hits, but unfortunately, I've gone through two in two months. I have switched from smoking cigs so I do vape on it a LOT. That being said, I wish they would last a little longer than a month. They start doing the blue light flashing thing and then stop working. I understand juice may be getting in the hardware. \u000a\u000aI have had the sourin air, and I find you have to suck on it harder to get a hit which, maybe I have weak jaws, I just did not like that. I like that you don't have to hit on the drop hard to get a good vape. It's easy to suck!\u000a\u000aI am not really wanting to go back to the pen style. I'm interested in the ALD Lemon Amaze, but don't see many reviews of that yet. \u000a\u000aAny recommendations? &lt;3
