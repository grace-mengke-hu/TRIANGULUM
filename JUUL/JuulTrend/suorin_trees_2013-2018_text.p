VWhen I\u2019m high and get a buzz from a sourin (e-cig) I get way more light headed than if I was not high, so the nicotine doesn\u2019t make the weed intense but the weed makes the nic intense

aVlosing all my shit cause of my smoke anxiety. :(\u000a\u000aSo on Saturday, a few friends and I smoked about a gram from my new pipe and this was probably the highest I've ever been. \u005c(I have only smoked a few times before\u005c) I was super shlump and we walked back to my friends house and I forgot about my appearance in general so when my mom came to pick me up she was like "why do you smell like pot?" \u005c(she probably wouldnt have been that mad but my high ass was terrified\u005c) So I tried to talk my way out of it by saying that the people I was with were smoking cigarettes and using a vape which was true, I just left out the smoking weed part, and she stopped interrogating me but was definitely on to me. I was super scared and decided I needed to hide all of my stuff in the bathroom so I put my pipe, vape, juice, weed, and all the other stuff in various drawers and containers however I was so high I cant remember where I put my suorin drop and its driving me insane. My mom never ended up searching my room so that was all for nothing as well. If i dont find it this afternoon I will have to ride my bike up to the vape shop, hope that they have it, add on that it is 40 dollars, and in texas its hella hot so ugh. oh well how was your day?

aVStupid question and I know it won\u2019t work BUT\u000a\u000aI\u2019m getting this sc labs skunk #1 wax cartridge but I don\u2019t have a pen. What would happen if I filled a sourin air with the wax? 
p3
aVNot sure if you\u2019ve already considered it but I\u2019d highly recommend vaping. You don\u2019t need to spend a lot or get a huge mod id suggest a small all in one kit with some salt nicotine juice. Something like the aspire breeze, sourin air/drop. Going in to your local shop and just asking questions could be the first step towards being cigarette free. \u000a\u000aI don\u2019t know to much about the benefits of CBD but If you want to try it out I\u2019d say go for it.

aVSourin drop\u000a\u000aHi r/trees, recently I purchased a sourin for cheap from a friend and I was wondering if it would be possible to use the extract from a carti and put that in the sourin pod, if not, is there any other type of extract that I could use. Thanks :)
p5
aVI\u2019m using 2 of those 3 right now! The puffco and suorin drop are awesome!
p6
aVAgreed, puffco gets a bad rap for their batteries but function on low setting is pretty legit and loading is simplest I've ever seen. Sourin is hands down my favorite though. Always in my pocket

aV4.8 G Nug In The Ounce I Got (Suorin Drop for Comparison)\u000a\u000a
p8
aVGet it. Its the best I usually take moles (tobacco and weed in a bong) and never crave it because of the Juul. My cousin is a heavy cigarette smoker and showed her the juul. Now her and all her friends have a juul. Personally I use a sourin drop because juul pods are expensive. I know a lot about e-cigs so dm me if you have in questions.
p9
aVNo sorry best you can get is some money off autoship. If your looking for something cheaper look into the sourin drop or air. 
p10
aVThis only happens to me when I take hits from my suorin (e-vape)\u000a\u000aBut when I smoke or hit from my pen I get the exact opposite
p11
aVNice sourin drop
p12
aVI have a question about vape carts\u000a\u000aI have a Suorin air for vaping nic, and I was wondering if I get a vape cart if I could just like pop it open and take the juice out of it and put it into my vape. Would this work, or do I need to get a special kind of vape/ vape juice?
p13
aVJust quit nicotine and got rid of my sourin drop. :( Enjoy your week!
p14
aVThe juul is super easy to refill, and there are videos online, the only problem is I notice (for me at least) that the pod leaks afterwards when you hit it. I got a suorin drop and it refills much better, but I'm not sure if you can put thc juice in it if that's what you're looking for.
p15
aVBest CBD e-juice for Sourin products?\u000a\u000aI have a Sourin drop and I wanted to get CBD e-juice for it but I\u2019m not sure what brand to shop or where to get the best product. Any tips?
p16
aVGround score! Also, love you're rocking a Suorin!
p17
aVWhat flavor you got for your suorin bruh?
p18
aVAyy I\u2019m also rocking a suorin, I have both the drop and the air and they\u2019re amazing!
p19
aVYeah I think suorin have a much cleaner hit. but nothing will come close to hat mango taste.
p20
aVOh God yes. I have a Sourin Drop (Kind of like a Juul, in that it is small and has a high nicotine content) and when I'm high I go at it nonstop

aVSourin and other vapes eliminate coughing after dabs.\u000a\u000aOk hear me out here. I\u2019ve been dabbing a couple times a day for about half a year now. I got used to coughing but big dabs just hurt and will make even the most seasoned stoners hack a lung. While dabbing with my girlfriend she was super high and hit the sourin before  exhaling a big dab... and didn\u2019t cough for a second. I\u2019ve tried this for days and It really really works. Have any of you experienced similar things? This has made dabbing a LOT easier for me and I hope It can help anyone who struggles with some tiny lungs :)

aVKronic made me hallucinate and blackout (at school)\u000a\u000aSo today at school me and my friends were in the gym and one of my friends handed me his sourin air. He told me it was straight Kronic. Almost all of my friends had tried it before so I decided I would be fine because I do smoke atleast 2-3 times a week. So I ended up taking 3, six second hits. Almost immediate after I started to feel my heart rate increasing and the hallucinations began. The floor began getting further and further away and everything around me began to changing suddenly I started falling. I was going in and out of the hallucination and my heartbeat was online getting faster at this point. I sat there for what seemed to be hours, but was only about 10 minutes. The bell rang and I got up and began walking once I got out of the gym things started to get weird. (now let me mention I go to a large school so the hallways are extremely crowded). Everything began to feel and look animated as if I was in a game or something. All of a sudden I loose my center of gravity and I started running into the lockers still walking but leaned against the lockers the was the first blackout only lasting about 3 seconds. I fell to the ground I could hear people saying is that guy okay? My head started throbbing I could hear my heartbeat in my ears as if they were drums. I was walking leaning against the locker and running into people. I made it to my last class and luckily it was a review day.\u000aI still could barely breath after sitting down for 10 minutes I was able to breath again. I asked if I could go to the bathroom almost falling leaving the room. I made it to the bathroom but I felt like I was on fire (yes I actually thought I was on fire) I stuck my head in the sink but that didn't help. I fell to the ground as if every muscle in my body stopped working. Struggling to breath I made my way to a stall, I locked the door and leaned against the wall (still on the floor). I couldn't breath anymore and everything started to become black, I was laying on the floor I started shaking and my body began spasing out. I had blacked out laying on the floor in a school bathroom. Multiple times I woke up gasping for air but I couldn't breath. About 30 minutes later I woke up covered in sweat. I got up and made my way to the hand dryer where I the dried myself. A few different students walked in asking if I was okay but I couldn't respond. I guess one told a teacher because a teacher then came in and asked me what I was doing and why I was drenched in water. I told him that I had a panic attack and tried to cool my self off with water. He asked me a few more questions. Surprisingly he believed my story about how my parents were getting divorced and were fighting over custody of me which made me extremely anxious. He ended up getting me a new shirt from the lost and found which I changed into. I took the bus home and shortly after I felt fine. Hopefully Im fine

aVMaking distillate E-juice for a Suorin drop?\u000a\u000aRecently got a Suorin Drop that operates at around 1.4 ohms and some distillate, was wondering what I could mix it with and at what ratios to be able to make some THC juice that could work with it. Don\u2019t have the means to buy an official cartridge, so I\u2019m just curious on how to mix it with PG/what ratios/etc. Thanks in advance!

aVI\u2019m 16 &amp; I need a break\u000a\u000aI\u2019m 16. Let\u2019s just get that out of the way. Yesterday I was caught with weed for the second time. My parents are very liberal, and they don\u2019t mind people smoking, they just believe that it doesn\u2019t have a place in my life right now. Maybe they\u2019re right. I used to do it maybe 3 times a month, and that turned into once a week, then twice a week, then I was doing it more and more. Not only that, I used to strictly smoke with friends and/or my girlfriend, and now, I started doing it alone. It\u2019s become a nightly routine. My friends are starting to notice, my parents were suspicious, my girlfriend is starting not to like my habits, it\u2019s also starting to affect other aspects of my life. My motivation is dead, I used to work out, swim and run, I was in fantastic shape, but now, I\u2019ve quit all of my sports, and I haven\u2019t worked out once this month. I can tell if this correlates, but my relationship with my girlfriend feels like it\u2019s taking a toll. We have so many amazing moments, but we\u2019re fighting more and more. If we\u2019re not fighting we\u2019re getting high. My sex life feels more like it\u2019s about instant satisfaction rather than love, and that bothers me. My grades are slipping and I completely withdrew from my friend group. My new friend group, I love them, and we hang out without smoking sometimes, but honestly, we mostly just smoke. \u000a\u000aSo last night my parents smelled what we were doing, and that was it. They took half my stash, and my pipe. I was able to put the other half in another jar and give it to my girlfriend (who was at my house). They weren\u2019t mad, they just want me to stop escaping and focus on reality. And maybe they\u2019re right. That night I couldn\u2019t sleep. All I could think about was when I will smoke next. I stayed up until 4am playing video games (which I never do) stressing about something that should be a stressor. I hate how dependent and addicted I\u2019ve become. \u000a\u000aOne thing I credit to it getting worse is Reddit. 4 months ago all I had was a glass one hitter, now I\u2019m 16 with 2 bongs, 2 pipes, a dab pen, prerolls, a grinder, juul and sourin. It all started with the one hitter. I wanted a better way to smoke, and the one hitter looked like a good downstem for a water bottle bong, so I googled it, which led me to r/stonerengineering . I made all these homemade contraptions (many of which I shouldn\u2019t never smoke out of, check my post history). That sub lead me to r/trees, r/weed, r/pieces, etc. I\u2019m currently subscribed to 7 drug related subs. \u000a\u000aAnd the more I saw these post, the more I became a part \u201cweed culture\u201d and more I wanted to smoke. I started watching Eric Khan on YouTube, pot started becoming more of a personality trait rather than an activity. I quit my 2 jobs, and I\u2019ve been pouring what little money I\u2019ve had saved into buying glass, cartridges, and actual tree. \u000a\u000aAll last year (July 2017- March 2018) I smoked and got drunk. I quit for a while (March- August). Late August, gf and I thought it would be okay to start again, and I was. But these past 4 months, it\u2019s gone downhill VERY fast. It has never gotten this out of hand last year. \u000a\u000aSo what now? Well the new year is quickly approaching. I have 2g left (the rest is still confiscating). I have no intention of getting rid of my pieces, or my weed. But I know I need a break. So I\u2019ve sworn to not smoke until I have another job. The end of my grading period at my school is quickly approaching and I need to focus on that. My friends are all gone for winter break, so I don\u2019t have them asking me to smoke with them rn, but I\u2019ll have to tell them about my break. I\u2019ll save the 2g for later. \u000a\u000aWeed will always be there. I need to focus
p28
aVAny juul/suorin compatible ones or do I have to go out and buy a new vape
p29
aVcan I get a bong??\u000a\u000aI have a legal medical marijuana license and I\u2019m 18 but the smoking age here is 21 so I can\u2019t buy anything from smoke or head shops. If I order one on eBay (and maybe a suorin too) will that work?? Or will the delivery people ID me? 
p30
aVTake my advice and do not buy a sourin they are the worst buy a Renova zero
