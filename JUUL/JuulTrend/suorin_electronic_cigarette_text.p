p8
aV&gt; I've heard good things about the Suorin Air\u000a\u000aThey've been lying to you, albeit unknowingly. Do a search for them on this subreddit. Roughly half a dozen posts each day about them breaking in various ways. Twice that when high school isn't in session.\u000a\u000aJuul is a popular pod system. You don't have to refill it or anything, just put a new pod in.\u000a\u000aPersonally, I feel the refillable kits to be worth the savings.\u000a\u000a

aVBought a Suorin Drop today...juice has no flavor whatsoever. Would switching to salts help?
p11
aVI got a brand new Suorin Air and it has not worked except for a few hits.  Got some regular juice from the place that sold the Air and they acted like it would be fine.\u000a\u000aOn the hits that did work, it was very harsh on the throat and it was hot to the lips if you kept pulling.  The coil is not burnt at all or anything. But literally every single hit is a misfire.  Barely hits and then starts blinking.  Honestly ridiculous.  Waste of money so far.  Is it the juice thats a problem or the device?
p12
aVSuorin Air Pod Replacement
p13
aVSuorin Air. I can\u2019t recommend the Breeze or similar.. changing flavors isn\u2019t easy and spit back is a pain. Air never leaks or has spit back given the design. Easy to swap pods for other flavors... and dirt cheap. 
p14
aV+1, since I've had the air it's out paced all other pod devices I own.  However, since I've bought the air, the suorin drop has been released and it's an upgrade however it's more expensive

aVI'd recommend the suorin drop over the juul, you get to pick out of many more flavors and it's much higher quality

aVHow to turn off blinking blue light on sourin drop

p30
aVI've used 25mg and 45mg in my suorin air with no problem, I personally prefer the 45mg. I normally put 6mg in my rdas and sub-ohm tanks. 
p31
aVLooking to get Suorin Air (coming from a Juul), does the liquid matter?
p32
aVOwned a Suorin Air. The Suorin Drop is a much better design. However, I have since switched to an Aspire Breeze due to lack of pods in my area. Definitely Drop &gt; Air though.
p33
aVIf you're trying to save money, I would not go with a juul. I've gone through a pod in a day and it starts to add up. I recently just bought a Suorin Drop and I am liking it very much. It has refillable pods so you can get juice that you enjoy the most (recommend going with nic salt based juice). Bought mine for $35 and after refilling the pods around 5 times they get bad so you'll need to pick new ones up. I think you can get them online for $3 a piece or a shop near me sells the pods for $5 a piece. Overall, would recommend over the juul. The drop is also very discrete you can hide it easily in your hand when you hit it.
p34
aVLove my Suorin Air, running some bombies cold press at 40mg. Highly recommend. 
p35
aVVape Pods are becoming more and more popular for (not the size of a light saber) or portable vapes. I just got the Suorin Drop and I've been pretty pleased with it so far. But I do know that [Pods](https://www.ecigaretteempire.com/collections/vape-pods) arn't for everyone, some people like to have that bulky bigger set up. As for juice I always refer people to [here](https://www.ecigaretteempire.com/collections/e-juice-brands) because I simply haven't been able to find better deals anywhere and they generally are always in stock of my Bam Bam's that I vape religiously lol. You can always check JuiceDB to find great deals as well 
p36
aVFor juice I would recommend Blue Dot Vapors. You can get 100ml of juice for $18. Depending on how much you vape that 100ml could last you anywhere from a week to a month.\u000a\u000aTo give some examples on usage.. When I'm working I take a Suorin Drop with 45mg nicotine salts and vape maybe 2mls over the whole day. This is because it is a low power device so I use a higher nicotine concentration so I can get my fix quick without blowing massive clouds all over. \u000a\u000aWhen I'm home I typically use a Smoant Charon device with a Uwell Crown 3 tank with 6mg nicotine juice. It depends on the day but if I'm home all day I may end up going through 20mls if not more. This is because it's a higher powered device with a lower nicotine concentration. This way I just casually vape through the day, blow some clouds and enjoy the flavor of the juice.\u000a\u000aSo two very different ends of the spectrum for two different kinds of need. I would highly recommend the Crown 3 tank, it looks nice, vapes great and I haven't had any issues with it. Coils are a few bucks each and with care typically last me 2-3 weeks before needing replacement. The Charon device is great but I wouldn't recommend it as a first device. It has glass on both sides and a large touch screen. Add in the very hefty weight and I don't even want it to accidentally knock it over and chance breaking the glass. Hence that device never leaves the house. \u000a\u000aIt can be overwhelming getting into it. Especially now with so many different options. I was overwhelmed even back in 2013 when I first started learning about vaping. Nowadays there is much more support, the products are better and it's much easier to make the change. Stick to it, once you've got a good setup going you'll never want to look back.

p38
aVCrackling sound from suorin whenever I take a hit.
p39
aVUsually I use a JUUL but I've been partial to the [Suorin Air](http://www.infinitevapor.com/The-Suorin-Air_p_404.html) lately. Perfect stealth vape since it's smaller than my drivers license and the flavor is surprisingly good.
p40
aVVgod box mod 150w. Just a solid device overall. I've yet to have any problems with it in these 6 months while having it as my daily driver. Still looks mint as heck and I love the shape and simplicity it has.\u000a\u000a\u000aAlso shoutout to my Suorin Air. Found the pod i'll probably be sticking with for a long while. Compact, beautiful experience and most of all convenient as hell ( 30 minute charge time with a day or two of use!!!? )
p41
aVFor me it is the suorin air. No problems, easy to use and very convenient. 
p42
aVThe Suorin Air. I've been using VW devices with RDAs for a few years, and I picked up the Suorin on a whim a few months back. Paired with a good nic-salt juice, the throat hit is the closest thing that I (personally) have found to a real cigarette. The battery life is surprisingly great for a device it's size, I manage a vape shop and I can get through a full 8-hour day only having to charge it once, if at all. Not to mention, having a device that can still give me a head rush is a rarity these days. And it's much less cumbersome than my other devices.
p43
aVSmoant Battlestar. However the device that made the biggest difference has been the Suorin Air. It finally got my girl off cigs because it's tiny and cute. I'm not a fan of pod like devices but it did the most important thing in getting someone to quit cigarettes. That's what is most important in any device. 
p44
aVIm thinking about getting a pod based MTL device, because I chug and MTL through my sub-ohm tank like no ones business and going through 10 mL a day. I\u2019m stuck between the Suorin Air and the Suorin Drop. I\u2019m leaning more towards the Air, mostly because of looks, and I\u2019ve heard the Drop\u2019s pods are sometimes loose. What would you guys recommend?
p45
aVHave you not seen the Sourin posts in the sub?
p46
aVI don\u2019t know that you have. There are at least 5 Sourin complaint posts a day on here. I don\u2019t think you want to go with one of those.
p47
aVDamn I\u2019m really bummed Suorin is AIDS. A dude at my local B&amp;M showed me his a month or two ago and I fell in love but haven\u2019t gotten it yet, and kind of glad I haven\u2019t 
p48
aVOk because the main reason I want to switch is I\u2019m not getting enough of a kick from 6mg subohm anymore, but 12mg destroys my throat. after trying a buddy\u2019s juul I wanted a device meant for MTL because I already MTL my subohm tank. Thanks for your help though, definitely appreciate it because I probably would\u2019ve gotten a Suorin

p57
aVI might try this out and add nic salts for my pocketable vapes like the Suorin Air. \u000a\u000aPurely nostalgic for me. I got into vaping after a surgery and quit smoking - since I couldn\u2019t smoke indoors and couldn\u2019t walk much for weeks. The first juice I got was a Baja Blast from a local vendor. \u000a\u000a
p58
aVI recently switched to a Suorin Air and nic salt juice...So easy and cheap. I'm never going back to my "cloud bro" setups
p59
aVI own both a sourin air and a box mod. I like alternating between the two because they both have unique characteristics. It also gives me a break between vaping the same flavor so I never get vapers tongue like I use to.
p60
aVI'm using the suorin air right now as well until my aspire Zelos comes in the mail Tuesday (first real mod). Battery is great and as long as you aren't chain vaping a cartridge should last about a week. It puts out some big hits so 3 pulls of some strong nic salt juice and i get a buzz that holds me off for a good amount of time. I'll keep it around to bring on campus and when going out while i leave the mod at home. form factor is perfect to slide into my pocket and nobody can even tell its a vape, even those who actually are familiar with vaping.
p61
aVSuorin drop
p62
aVI have a breeze and and an Icare 2 and a sourin air. Get a breeze if you upgrade.
p63
aVI am in the same place you are, maybe a month or two ahead. I have pretty much retired my fleet of kanger subtanks and have almost fully replaced them with 2 Suorin Airs and 2 Suorin Drops. I ran across this comparison but not sure who owns it.\u000a http://www.podmodvaping.com/analytics.html\u000a\u000aI am sticking with the Suorins for now, but looking for something with longer battery life. The damn thing is so small though, I just carry two and they're still more convenient than a tank, extra juice, extra batteries etc. I am very interested in the Sigelei Compak OB One (previously Compak M) but am waiting for more reviews before I pull the trigger. \u000a\u000aThe pods are expensive, but the tradeoff in juice consumption for me is making up for it. If used correctly, a pod can be filled 3-5 times or more and I'm using a fraction of the juice. Even with heavy usage, 2-4ml of high nic salt juice will easily last an entire day. \u000a\u000a
p64
aVQuite honestly.. those are pretty garbage. For something small and cheap for the go, just get the Suorin Air. The breeze and iCare have issues with spit back. And changing the flavors in those things is a hassle. With the Air, you have separate pods so you can just swap flavors on the go. 
p65
aVLook for a sale and grab a few, once you know you like the Suorin Air, get more. :)\u000a\u000aI just pulled the trigger on the Compak OB One. Great deal on Heaven Gifts, but will likely take several weeks to arrive...
p66
aVHave had zero issues with it. When or where did you buy it? Or what kind of juice are you using in it? I\u2019ve legit never had any pods that were bad outside the old design. The previous version was garbage and I got rid of it. Basically the V2 has temperature control and different pods. \u000a\u000ahttp://vaping360.com/suorin-air/\u000a\u000aI threw away the first one I had. I also tossed the Drop since it\u2019s dog shit. But generally speaking, it\u2019s been flawless with 70/30 vg/pg Salt nic juices. 
p67
aVjuul or suorin air
p68
aVI\u2019ve work for a shop and have used both the Mi-Pod and the Suorin Drop. Of course there is mAh difference between the two, the Mi-Pod being a 950mAh and the Drop a 350mAh. I bought the Drop and have used it for a week straight, only having charged it once and just finished my first fill up on my pod last night. I\u2019d say flavor wise, the Suorin Drop has the best flavor.
p69
aVSuorin Drap is very nice. 
p70
aVAir &gt; Drop by a long shot. Drop has issues connecting to the Power source so sometimes you won't get a good hit. Suorin is coming out with a pen style pod system called the iShare I think.
p71
aVMi Pod, followed by the Sourin Drop
p72
aVMy iCare starts tasting like crap very quickly. 50/50 nic salt juice. It's like it can't wick fast enough. If it worked a lil better in that regard I'd love it. Got my GF to quit smoking though so that's a positive. \u000a\u000aI'm gonna try the sourin drop next. Should come Tuesday. 
p73
aVI love my Suorin drop. All day. Everyday. 
p74
aVDoes the kandypens rubi give you any burnt hits? I've been having that issue with the Suorin Drop...
p75
aVPlease let me know how this is! I just bought a Suorin Drop and have found that it hits great with good flavor but after a couple refills of the pod I have been getting a burnt taste. I have around 5-6 replacement pods and with 2 left have been slowly realizing that I have not yet found the Juul-replacement I was looking for.\u000a\u000aThe Dolphin looks sweet and is in the same price range. Would really like to be satisfied with the product of choice so I'd really appreciate hearing your feedback after a couple of days!!

aVI was debating making this shitpost myself. \u000a\u000aBut holy shit it's like the alien all over again. There were literally **4** sourin posts in a row the last time I sorted by new....
p83
aVI don't want to be accused of being a shill for Suorin Air but really all these negative posts surprise me. We've sold about 100 of them and have not had a single complaint (other than not being able to keep the pods in stock). I looked at the posts today and it seems like every 3rd or 4th post is a negative Suorin post. \u000a\u000aIt may be that it's very popular for the underage crowd. The biggest (and only) complaint we've had is that our juice doesn't give a good enough buzz from the Suorin Air buyers. This has only happened a few times but it's enough that even if our 3rd party age verification passes you, we still ask for a picture of your ID.\u000a\u000aEdit...we really have gotten a couple of nasty emails about not getting a buzz from Suorins.
p84
aVI wish I could just filter out the word Suorin from all of reddit and be done with it already.\u000a\u000aThat would be my Christmas miracle. 
p85
aVI know 4 or 5 people who got one just when they were introduced, and I did also.  I have not had a single problem and neither have they.\u000a\u000aI'm thinking that Suorin screwed up when they ramped up production.  Maybe a different assembly process or maybe cheaper parts.  There's no denying that there currently seems to be a problem but from my little world it was once a decent pod system.\u000a\u000aIt's a shame, especially for all the people who wasted their money on the recommendations of the early adopters.  They weren't lying to you - I don't think the Air that's for sale today is the same as what it was.

p96
aVNot enough info to go off of. Do they want something that drags sort of like a cigarette? Then the dolphin or suorin drop would probably be a good starter.\u000aI, like many others, started with an Aspire pen-styled vape with... I think a nautilus mini(?) on it. That worked well for a while, but a year or so down the line I moved on to a simple af internal battery tesla that was capable of sub-ohm direct to lung puffs. Basically, you'd need to know what they're after and if they'd even be able to stick with it or if they'd go back to smoking.

p112
aVBecause the Suorin Air is likely a piece of shit designed for the underage crowd.\u000a\u000aDo a search. There's only been a few hundred complaints this week.
p113
aVThere are some youtube hacks on how to fix that problem. The Suorin Drop is great, btw, in case you're thinking about switching. Pods are lasting me a month each on average, very smooth hit and super stealth - totally silent, not even a slight whistle.
p114
aVI'm enjoying the Suorin Drop as well. Was going to replace my week old pod, but it's still going, so I'm going to see how much longer I get out of it.
p115
aVFor the Suorin Drop pod, I stuck a paper clip and fan the cotton out a little bit. I don't know how easy it is to do for the Air pods. Also, don't fill it to the brim. I leave a little bit of room for air bubbles so it won't vacuum lock.
p116
aVI need advice on the suorin air.
p117
aVWhy anyone would get a Juul when the Suorin Air exists is beyond me.  Well I guess brand recognition and convenience. 
p118
aVCan I ask how long you've been using the Suorin Air? I bought one and 3 pods for it. The first pod started dry hitting on the 2nd fill but the other 2 have been fine. i want to order a couple more but there are so many negative comments here I feel like I'm a drag or two away from failure.
p119
aVThe reason why they're so addictive is because of the Benzoic acid they put into the juices. The 5% nicotine is equal to 59mg nic/ ML per pod. \u000a\u000aThe benzoic acid is that allows the nicotine to be absorbed into the body at a much faster rate. Hence why the consumer always receives the experience of their first cigarette after hitting the juul for the first time of the day. Every. Day.\u000a\u000a https://support.juulvapor.com/home/learn/faqs/juulpods-juice    -     Sauce \u000a\u000aI manage multiple vape shops and receiving 25+ calls a day about juul pods can easily be aggravating . \u000a\u000aAlso, a customer is paying 16.99-19.99$+ for a pack of pods. In each pod is 0.7 ML , so they're paying close to $20 for 2.4ML of juice. That's over $170 for a freaking 30ML!!!! I want to feel sympathy for the juul users, and I try to explain the math to my customers but a lot are too intransigent to switch to a Suorin or a breeze.
p120
aVHow many refills can you get out of the pods? Do you have a Juul as comparison? It\u2019s caught my eye however every Juul alternative I\u2019ve tried so far is now collecting dust. I\u2019m looking for a similar draw. Any leaking issues? I saw that suorin also has a new device coming out called the ishare (stick device with pcc). 
p121
aVRight now just my suorin before i get my next full size mod in a few weeks. I'm looking at either the Wismec cb-60 or joyetech exceed box kit. I'm a MTL kinda guy if you have any other suggestions for a reasonable first kit

aVStrange. If you\u2019ve tried other pods and other juices and it still hits dry then maybe it\u2019s your sourin that\u2019s messed up. How long have you had it? 
p125
aV Have you tried using a new pod?  I've never personally tried Mr. Salt-E but I've also never had issues with lack of flavor on the Suorin Air.  I've gone through about 5 cartridges myself and tried about 12 flavors without any issues. 
p126

aVMy mom was similar. Smoked for many years and didn't like the ego I got her a year or so ago. Got her a suorin drop recently and she likes it so far. Still has a few cigs occasionally but it's simple and doesn't need many hits as long as you're using a salt based e liquid. I've tried the drop too and I think it's pretty smooth. I can't comment on battery life yet as my mom doesn't use it frequently but it charges fairly quick.

aVHello yesterday I ordered suorin air replacement pods and I just wanna know how long does it take for them to ship it out and has anyone orderd from their site

p133
aVGood evening few more days left at work. Oh the excitement.  Ohh and today has been full of cringe from the kids running in here with their sourin air issues and busted capes. Lol
p134
aVI've used the following:\u000a\u000a* **Suorin Air**  - refillable 2ml pods are nice. One went bad on the 2nd fill, but the other 2 I've tried lasted longer. Lots of posts about these failing. So far so good but I want to find a replacement.\u000a\u000a* **Phix** - I liked this device a lot, and really enjoyed the Butterscotch Tobacco but the pods spit back and leak to the point I was constantly blowing through it to clear juice before using.\u000a\u000a* **iCare v1** - hated this, constant dry hits and just bad performance.\u000a\u000a* **Envii Fitt** - this was pretty nice. Good variety of flavors, though the pods did leak some. Might try it again with refillable pods.\u000a\u000a* **Juul** - I used Juul for a year and a half but their QC is garbage, they seem to have changed the flavors some, and the popularity with high school kids means pods can be hard to find.\u000a\u000a* **Innokin Pocketmod** - So far this is my favorite of the bunch. Solid build, bulkier than the others but the 1.2ohm coils work well with nic salts. Will buy another.\u000a\u000a\u000aI also want to try the Fuchai v3, Warlock Peas, and Kimsun Slim 2R.

aVNicotine juice for Suorin Air?
p138
aVwww.saltnic.com has great salt juice, the 25mg is perfect for the Suorin Air. They actually have package deals, and are having a sale. Just bought my wife 2 more bottles of their Luscious juice, it's pretty tasty. Mango is even better but I think they're sold out. Also there is normally a Reddit20 code for 20% off but they disable it during sales.
p139
aVI use Naked 100 salts, they work great. I use 3mg nic in a regular device (Super Tank Mini at around 40w) and 35mg nic salt in the Suorin Air or other pod devices.

p141
aVhttps://imgur.com/I0FfRqx - This week's vape. \u000a\u000aInstalled Arctic Fox on the Invoke, still didn't perform well. It went back into the box. It's a shame, since I do like the form factor of the device. \u000a\u000aThe Suorin Drop works great for my out about sneak-a-vape device. I have Naked 100 Really Berry Salt 35mg loaded in it. No problems with it so far (no leaking, no burnt hits, works as intended); QC lottery on the pod, I guess. I do compulsively clean the area where the contacts are, and the airflow path from condensation when I refill it. I refill it whenever I get home (nowhere close to empty), though, it's a bit of a pain to refill with glass dropper.
p142
aVEvery time I hit my sourin air my mouth produces so much saliva, I have to spit every time. My friend said this happens to her as well, does anyone know why? (I\u2019m wondering if it has anything to do w the fact that my juice has nicotine salts)

aVQuestion about vapes and suorins
p144
aVNone of the pod system is going to give clouds. I'm getting along with the Suorin Drop great, there are many complaints about the Suorin Air/Drop in this sub though.\u000a\u000aPremixed nic salt will come in high concentration of nic 25-50mg. There's DIY mixer that will do custom nic salt concentration in r/DIY_classifieds.
p145
aVA lot of Suorin hate on this sub. I only have 2 weeks experience with my Drop. Longevity is far from being tested yet. Could be a case of playing the QC lottery with these pod mods.\u000a\u000aFor what it's worth, the Drop works great so far for me, although I didn't have much expectation for it to begin with.
p146
aVI ordered Suorin Air with regular Naked 100 liquids 3mg Lava Burst and 6mg Hawaiian POG. Will see how it works :P I hope I made a good choice. I am also considering to buy the Rofvape Warlock Peas
p147
aVThis. I have a 45 mg juice in my Suorin and you'll definitely feel that buzz or rush after a couple hits.
p148
aVYes, and you have the real problem of it not working, just like all those other users.\u000a\u000aFace it, the Suorin is made to be thrown away.
p149
aVSo i ordered a sampler pack from B-X vapors and the guy hooked it up and upgraded my order all from 10ml to 15ml ! Ok so now I have over 200ml of juice on hand, but with my suorin I'm only vaping 1-2ml per day. How should i store all of this juice to make sure it doesn't go bad? Is room temp in a closet alright or should i put them in the fridge? Also should I leave them all sealed? Some people are saying when they steep the juice they crack the seal and then age them. TIA
p150
aVAs far as I know, nope.\u000a\u000aA pod system really sounds like your best bet. Like the Breeze or Sourin Air. The issue is that pod systems came about from JUUL's being so expensive and non-refillable, so any pod system you will have to fill just like any atomizer.
p151
aVOkay so I am left with 4 vapes to choose from:\u000a\u000a- Aspire Breeze, its little bulky, the liquid fill system is not great, no replacable pods\u000a\u000a- Suorin Air, I like that its so thin but Im not sure if its comfortable to use, the battery is not too big\u000a\u000a- iCare 2, I dont think there is anything to complain about here, they fixed the driping issues\u000a\u000a- iCare Solo, its the best design for me, i like the Juul-like style, dont know too much about this, there isnt many comparison\u000a\u000aWhich would you recommend? 
p152
aVsourin air (drop)
p153
aVI can't tell if I can't understand what you're asking because a) you're not making much sense or b) I'm drinking. The sentence "I just bought a new sourin air today and I switched to the drop" seems contradictory, they're two different devices. Which one are you having trouble with?\u000a\u000aRegardless, there's been a spate of posts about both of them not working well, so the answer may jsut be "buy a new thing"
p154
aVIt all boils down to what you're looking for, I use them both daily. The Air seems to have a tighter draw, but is prone to dry hit. I'd recommend thinner juice, smaller hits and/or space out the hits to allow it to wick. The Drop seems to have a slightly looser draw, wicks better, with rarely a dry hit. The Drop goes through juice slightly faster and you have to open the pod frequently to equalize the dual chamber (seems to vapor lock). The Drop has also given me problems with not hitting at all until I remove/reinstall the pod. I do like the Suorin fleet for the tiny form factor, but I have ordered the Siegeli Compak OB One (updated version of the Compak M). Same size pod as the Suorins with longer battery life. I didn't get any input from this sub, but I still took a chance on a Christmas sale...
p155
aVI've had my suorin air 2 for about 6 weeks with absolutely 0 problems. I also personally know about 5 other people at my school who are using the air 2 without problems. I know it gets a lot of heat around here but as someone who has no interest in big mods or customizing anything this thing has been amazing. I usually switch pods every 15-20ml of juice (im using the solace nic salt 30mg rn but am going to try out normal juice at 18mg soon) and have never had problems burning out pods or had any leaks. Its less than $30 for the kit and about $3-$4 for the refillable pods which is much cheaper than your juul. Looks cool too
p156

aVThrow it away and buy another one (or another device altogether). The Suorin isn't known for quality. I say this as a mostly happy owner of one, but it looks like I got lucky? 
p158
aVI have had my Sourin Air for a couple of weeks and it has been great! The only problem I have had is some minor leaking, so I just opened it up and cleaned the inside. However, today it stopped taking a charge (the blue light does not turn on when I plug the cable in) can someone help me fix this?

p163
aVAlright..i appreciate you commenting..what should i do with the suorin? 
p164
aVive been looking up things on youtube and it tells me to clean it by popping out the interior of the suorin..but i dont wanna fuck up my device..so im not sure if i should continue 
p165
aVI opened up the cartridge..cleaned it..then i put it back together and let the suorin run for a bit..after that it worked just fine..and the crackling noises are happening because i currently have no nicotine in my juice.

aVSourin Air - easy fix
p167
aVDon't vape oils. It'll give you pneumonia and possibly kill you.\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aYou might like a pod system. They're about the size of 2-6 cigarettes tied together. Some of them have a button you press that starts them and some just autostart when you begin sucking on the mouthpiece.\u000a\u000aJuuls aren't refillable, but they're popular. You just have to keep buying their pods with their juice in it.\u000a\u000aDon't buy Suorin products; lots of people have issues with them.. probably stay away from Eleaf iCares, too.\u000a\u000aAspire Breeze seems decent, it fires when you draw on it.. Atopack Dolphins seem OK, they have a button that fires them and they can fit a lot of liquid.\u000a\u000aThere are a lot of other pod systems that I'm not aware of. Maybe try watching some YouTube reviews. (Just remember that most reviewers aren't reviewers.. they're salesmen disguised as reviewers. Some are trustworthy, but those guys are few and far between.)\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aIf you really want something the size of a cigarette, you might just go to a gas station and pick up a cigalike. They're honestly crap.. with tiny batteries and not much juice in them, but if you're just an occasional smoker the low entry price might be up your alley. I know I quit smoking using MarkTens from the coupons they sent me through the mail. (Regularly they're ~$10 for one battery and one cartomizer, then ~$10 for two cartomizers. One cart would last me about a day.) I found out you can remove the back of the cartomizers and fill them up with your own eliquid, provided you have a small syringe to get it in there. (Once I did that for a few weeks and decided that I liked vaping, I gave those away to another smoker and bought myself real vape gear.)
p168
aVIm looking to buy my first full size MTL mod to use at home while I bring my suorin around when on the go. Do you think this would work well for a beginner? I'd like to not have to deal with a complicated device aside from changing coils every once in a while. Im more concerned about flavor than clouds in the mod i get
p169
aVI didn't enjoy the coils TBH, when they worked they worked well but that was limited to a day or two for me.  I'm sure my vaping style has something to do with that but how much I can't honestly say.  If you're not a heathen like me and rip them I think you'll have more success. What I can tell you is the Nautilus 2 was more reliable but the flavor was far better in the Amor NS.  The box itself wasnt bad, in a bind it made for a great bottle opener too.\u000a\u000aEDIT: I'm using a Suorin Drop now and a Smok  Infinix.  The Drop hasn't been a problem at all, I get a few fills on the pods and no catastrophic incidents.  The Infinix is a sample, it's Smok's answer to the Phix. I have been vaping CRFT salts lately, their mint is a spearmint and that just tickles me. 
p170
aVHistory of Issues with Suorin Air
p171
aVHow long did each of your Suorins last you before these issues came up? I personally think a lot of it has to do with the style of vaping this encourages - small stealth setups that go in and out of pockets a lot. This causes a lot of dirt and debris to get into the little crevices in a device where you don't really want that stuff. Not to mention it's probably constantly getting jostled around, tossed places, and banged up against keys and phones and whatever else. \u000a\u000aIt really is a tiny, great device when it works well. My wife's has been working well for a good month or 2 now though, only problems so far have been with one pod that died after only refilling it a couple times, the cotton somehow exploded out into the reservoir. But it's awesome for the price point especially, in my opinion. Much better than an iCare 2.
p172
aVI dropped my suorin in water and its probably toasted. I want to take the body apart to try and salvage it. You just push the internals out with the small side of the pod?\u000a\u000aMy suorin was leaking juice through the bottom before this, so I was considering a new one anyway. Have you any experience we with the suorin drop?\u000a\u000a

p180
aVYeah I second u/lestermagneto 's suggestion that the wiki has a wealth of information, definitely a good guide! \u000a\u000aIf that's overwhelming though, I'd personally recommend getting a small mouth-to-lung kit with some 25-50mg nicotine salts. You can see if Mt. Baker Vapor still has the free Joyetech AIO (all-in-one) kit for free with code FLAVORNOW. Or another great device is the Suorin Air, I believe www.saltnic.com still has a $30 deal for the device and a 30ml bottle of their nicotine salts juice, and you can use code Reddit20 for 20% off.\u000a\u000aAlso, while I personally don't shop at Brick &amp; Mortar ("B&amp;M" or, "that vape shop down the street") stores due to higher pricing, they can be a very valuable resource for those looking to make the switch.

aVVery good note. Wasn't a fan of my pulse, refilled my phix once in a while but now my Suorin Air is acting up. Thinking maybe to get a mipod
p185
aVMiPod is definitely solid.  The Suorin Drop is pretty awesome so far as well, but I've heard mixed things on their durability.  I just keep going back to my iCare when I want a tiny high nic vape haha.  
p186
aVIf you just want a small setup for work and like MTL.. and you've been gone from the vaping scene for two years.. you may be interested in nicotine salt liquids.\u000a\u000aNicotine salt isn't salt; it's a different form of nicotine that's used in vape juice. It enters the body more quickly, so people can get a buzz like with a cigarette.\u000a\u000aWhen people use salt based juice, they usually don't go for 3/6/12mg strengths.. they go for 24/36/48mg strengths and only MTL it. There are new devices called pod systems with 2ml-6ml pods that you can refill (on most of them.) The pods easily fit into your pocket, so people take them on vacation and to work.. and they're a discreet MTL device, so you're not chucking clouds and drawing attention on your vape breaks.. and the high nicotine content means just a few drags is all you need to catch a nicotine buzz and get back to work.\u000a\u000aJuul makes the most popular one, but I think its pods aren't refillable. Stay away from Suorin products (Smok/Eleaf tier quality control, apparently.) Also, I've heard a few bad things about Eleaf's iCare 2.\u000a\u000aI think the better ones are Aspire Breeze / Atopack Dolphin (not Penguin, the Dolphin can MTL, the Penguin can't.) Sigelei and a few other manufacturers are getting into the market, too. Here's the first site I can think of that has a Pod section of devices they sell: http://www.myvaporstore.com/Pod-Systems-Ecig-Starter-Kits-s/525.htm\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aOh, and the nicotine salt juice.. (remember, it's not salty, it refers to the chemical form of the nicotine.)\u000a\u000aHere's a thread where they discuss some vendors and list another thread where other vendors of nicotine salt juices are listed: https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/7i6fww/alternative_nic_salt_companies

p193
aVThere's been a lot of advice here and I hope you don't read this too late, but I think the Suorin Air and some nic salt juice would be ideal in this situation.  \u000a\u000aThe Air is a pod based system, each pod lasts about five refills and each fill should get him a few days of use.  The pods are about 4 bucks each. They're virtually fool proof, you literally just put juice in it and snap the pod in place.  No changing coils, no adjusting wattage, no buttons and a charge lasts a decent amount of time, and they don't take long to charge. \u000a\u000aNic Salt juice is going to be better for him than regular nic juice.  Considering his heavy smoking habit, you'll need a higher nic content to really satisfy the craving.  I would get him some 50mg juice from Solace or Salty Man.  Both of them have decent tobacco flavors, Solace's juice comes in 15 ml bottles for like 8 bucks or so, so you can try a few different flavors.  \u000a\u000aThe air has a very high resistance on the coil, so he won't be blowing through juice, the little bottles will last a lot longer than with a more traditional set up.  \u000a\u000a
p194
aVSuorin Air keeps ripping
p195
aVThere's like 7 threads a day regarding this issue with the Suorin. Do a quick search to see if anyone has a fix.
p196
aVYep. Easy solution. You need to increase the airflow to the pod.  Search on you tube for a video called Suorin Air airflow hack with a guy in Hawaii. Basically there is a tiny metal clip between the 2 contact posts on the pod. Remove the clip from every new pod with your fingernail or a jewelers flathead. Problem solved.
p197
aVIt just hit me that you're talking about the iCare and I was talking about the iJust. Derp.. I'm not fully awake, at the moment.. and I'm sitting down, taking breaks from Photoshop and photographing old Masonic hats I'm trying to get on eBay before 8pm EST.\u000a\u000aSorry.. My experience was the same with the *iJust 2*.\u000a\u000aI think Eleaf just makes terri-bad coils.. and stores will never refund anything that's been used. I'd just suggest you save up for another device and learn to distrust Eleaf.\u000a\u000aThe Aspire Breeze / Atopack Dolphin are things I don't hear too many complaints about. Maybe look into one of those. Juuls have non-refillable pods and avoid anything from Suorin like it has leprosy. 
p198
aVIf you want a pod system like a Juul, Aspire Breeze or an iCare 2, go with nicotine salts. 24 / 36 or 48mg strength.\u000a\u000aI think Juuls aren't refillable, though.. so you might be happier with one of the other pod systems. \u000a\u000aOh, and stay far away from Suorin Air or Drop. We get more people coming here having problems with Suorin pods than any other pod.\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aThis link has some companies that sell nic salt juice: https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/7i6fww/alternative_nic_salt_companies In the comments of that post is also another post that has a few more listed.

p201

p202
aVSuorin Air Problems
p203
aVWhat, every time little Timmy posts a Suorin thread, you guys just do whatever the fuck you want?\u000a\u000aOk then. Carry on. 
p204
aVWell, you can start with a pen device that has a 510 connector, so you could get other tanks to use on it and keep diffferent flavors in them. The Innokin Endura T18 and T20 are fairly popular. I wouldn't recommend an iJust because it's only for direct lung inhaling (that's hitting it like a bong.)\u000a\u000aYou can also go with pod systems. You can't use other tanks with them, but they tend to be smaller and easier to fit into your pocket. Juul / Aspire Breeze / iCare 2 / Atopack Dolpin seem to be decent and fairly popular. I'd stay away from Suorin Airs and Drops, as they appear to have quality control issues. We see a lot of new vapers come here because their Suorin pods unexpectedly died.\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aNicotine salt juices also might help a new vaper transition from smoking.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/7i6fww/alternative_nic_salt_companies\u000a\u000aNicotine salts are absorbed into the body more quickly than regular vaping nicotine. You can get your morning nicotine buzz using salt based devices. If you go with a mouth to lung pod system, a lot of people run those with nicotine salts in high concentrations. I think 24 / 36 / 48 are the normal amounts of nicotine used in them.
p205
aVSuorin drop
p206
aVI don't know a whole load about them but given they're all fairly cheap I wouldn't be expecting the build quality on any of them to be great. The Suorin does seem to be a clunker based on post volume tho. If I was gonna go for one it'd probably be the Boulder Rock deal at Bombies - you get a 30ml bottle with that for $25
p207
aVOutside of the refill option (outside of opening and filling a used juul pod) what do you like better about it? I've had a juul for about the same time span as you have had the sourin, but the only con I can find is how expensive pods can be  (I've yet to try to refill any since I have a 2 half used ones and 2 full ones, and 8 coming). \u000a\u000aI was looking for a refillable option and the sourin is up on my list, but the size and shape of it made me look at a few others. \u000a\u000aI'm curious though as to what you found made you prefer it than the Juul, because it may be things I never considered or understimated. 
p208
aVPersonally I get much better hits off my drop. I have to take the stupid pods out of my Juul every 4 hits and shake the bubbles out. My only issue currently is finding Salt Nic juice that\u2019s good. It\u2019s expensive and there\u2019s so few choices/reviews. Solace strawberry hard candy is really good though. If you buy from [vapordna](https://www.vapordna.com/Holiday-Promotion-Suorin-Drop-and-Solace-Bundle-p/hpsula.htm) they have a holiday bundle where if you spend $25 or more you can get the Suorin Drop and the choice of either Solace Strawberry Hard Candy or Solace Mint for $19.99 using coupon code "DROP". That sounds weird but I copied and pasted that last bit from their website cause I\u2019m lazy but it\u2019s how I got mine plus some juice to try. 
p209
aVEnded up ordering the Suorin Drop bundle with my Element Vape GC. Got the Really Berry and Frost Bite nic salts in 35mg to go with the Drop. After that I figured I'd need pods, just in case, and ordered 8 pods + $20 Drop promo from VaporDNA.\u000a\u000aTotal came out to $106 (-$50 GC) for 2x Drop, 2x 30ml Naked Salt, 1x 15ml Solace salt, and 8 replacement pods. Not too bad, imho, but yeah, here's hoping they don't suck. 
p210
aVYou actually ordered a Suorin product as an ECR regular, after seeing post after post after post of issues? I envy your glass half full approach.\u000a\u000aI got a Roflvape peas a bit ago and have some 18mg salts in it, it works fairly well, but has absolutely 0 flavor. I have 2 flavors with 18mg salts currently, a grape from Mr. Hash, and a bottle of 0mg pinky I added 100mg salts base to, to make it 18mg. It has so little flavor, I can't tell which juice I am vaping.

I think it\u2019s just a design flaw.  \u000a\u000aI\u2019m still on my first Suorin Pod purchased on Black Friday and I think it\u2019s just the nature of these types of Pods.  Even the myjet had wick density issue, most were over stuffed with cotton.\u000a\u000aBut the experience has been pretty solid.  I\u2019ve been using Juul and Bo.  Between the two I\u2019ve found the Bo to be very consistent, but it got expensive.

aVThat's a wide range of flavors.. and you have a menthol tobacco. I smoked M Menthol for 20 years, so when I try a new vendor's juice I always go for the menthol, first.. although none of the ones I've tried ever seem to have enough menthol, even when billed as a strong menthol.\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aIf you're trying to increase your visibility, you might consider adding yourself to the Xmas/NewYear sale megathread.. along with a sale.  https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/7i7oc8/vendorsplease_submit_your_christmasnew_years_sale\u000a\u000aA giveaway here and there will also help people to realize that you exist.\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aYou should really spend a few hours adding yourself to the Juice DB: https://www.juicedb.com That's where a lot of people go to shop for juice by reading reviews and looking at their sales page. It's tedious work, but it's one of the things that differentiates large scale vendors from mom &amp; pop shops.\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aAlso, salt nicotine popularity is on the rise. People like high nicotine content salt liquids to use in pocket kits like iCares / Juuls / Aspire Breezes / Suorin "poor QC" Drops. They're mostly for a few short pulls while at work or on the go, when you don't want to rip clouds but still need a nicotine fix. Crafting a handful of salt liquids will put you on some people's radar that wouldn't otherwise bother with you.\u000a\u000a

aVwww.saltnic.com - the Tropical Mango is seriously delicious, even compared to "regular" juice. Also the Luscious (from the VGOD line) is tasty, but those are the only 2 I've tried from their line. It comes in 50mg or 25mg, and my wife uses the 25mg daily.\u000a\u000aThey actually have a good deal for starter combo, if they have them in stock the Suorin Air + 30ml bottle is $30, but they also have a Reddit20 code for 20% off. The owner is decently active here on r/ecr and is a really nice guy, I recommend their juice pretty much anytime I can!

aVHi there! I use a Suorin Drop, and I see a lot of the nicotine salt e-liquid that is advertised for use with it in 30mg, 45mg, and 50mg quantities, while traditional e-liquid I understand is in quantities of 1.5/3mg(s). \u000a\u000aI checked out your website and the flavors are interesting! I'm still looking for a lot of info on nicotine salts, etc. and I was wondering if you could tell me more...I am not sure if your products are the ones I am looking for!
p229
aVI've been using the Suorin Drop but I'm awaiting a shipment of the Kimsun Slim 2r (which I heard is temperature controlled), and the Atopack Dolphin (I'm hoping I get a better MTL hit with this one and less burnt pods, we'll see...)
p230
aVAny suggestions for a "stealth setup" AIO? Something along the lines of an Aspire Breeze or Suorin Air. Best bang for your buck?
p231
aVDon't know much about either but this week's count of 'my Suorin is doing lol something I don't know halp lol' to 'I'm having issues with my Breeze' posts is about 5000:1 so I'd go with the Aspire based on nothing other than that.

aV[Review] Suorin Drop
p242
aVI am always on the lookout for small devices that pack some punch - good for quick hits at work, between flights, etc.\u000a\u000aI used Juul for a good year and a half but their QC is awful. They seem to have thinned out the liquid and cheaped out on flavors as they have all seemed to change in the last year and the pods burn through much faster, if they work at all.\u000a\u000aI just picked up a Suorin Air and love it so far. I have some nic salt 35mg (NKD 100) arriving today. It has 2ml refillable pods and hits really nicely so far.\u000a\u000aI've also tried the Phix, Envii Fit, and iCare at various times and neither really did the trick. The Phix pods had good flavor but so much spitback I had to blow through the pod to clear juice every so often. The original iCare was just not good and dry hit constantly. The Fit definitely came the closest, but the refillable pods weren't available at the time.
p243
aVSo I just cleaned my Suorin Air from the inside out and when I take a hit it starts to auto fire after I draw. I can take the cartridge out and stop it but I can\u2019t figure out how to get it to stop without removing it. Any suggestions?
p244
aV-&gt; r/Suorin
p245
aVI\u2019m liking my Suorin Drop. A semi-loose mouth to lung, really easy to use, pretty fast charging. Looks a little funky (like a water drop) but it\u2019s actually really comfortable to hold and vape. 
p246
aVIf you're worried about cost, get a suorin air or suorin drop. Look up "Pbusardo suorin drop" on YouTube for a good review. If you don't mind spending the money on pods, then get a Juul. The Juul is far and beyond the best pod system, he's just the cost of the pods that's a little over the top.
p247
aVAny pod system you use with pre filled pods will only last you as long as you use it. Fill your own pods are good but the coils in them don't last very long if you chain vape them. Fillables are going to cost more dependent on juice. Pre filled pods are very expensive if you use them a lot because pods run dry. The phix has the largest pods I've used for pre filled. So that's my go to for a pre filled system. The suorin drop is my go to for fill your own. 
p248
aVI'm loving the Suorin Drop. Super stealth, quiet, feels so good in hand and smooth draw, refillable. So far I've filled my first pod 7 or 8 times even though they say 5 times. Pods are pretty cheap too, at 3.99.
p249
aVIf you're looking to get back into the swing of things, start small. I'd suggest something like the Suorin Drop or the iCare 2. If you want something more substantial - the Vaporesso Swag kit is a nice 80w set up.
p250
aVIf you want a small mtl people seem to like the aspire breeze and suorin air, if you want a mod/atty I would highly recommend a pico with a supertank mini or a wasp nano if you want to go the rda route. The pico also comes in a squonk version perfect for the wasp. I have a battlestar with a peerless se on top and I find myself using my pico/wasp way more because of similar reasons to yours.
p251
aVBouncing off the suggestions of /u/pandaontheloose and /u/tentonshogun . It seems like if you're looking for something "not to blast your lungs/esophagus/stomach too hard", a kit like the suorin drop, icare 2, or aspire breeze would be the route to go. If you are set on getting into a mod/tank combo, supertank uses a lot of different coils so I imagine you could find one that would work well with higher nicotine content juices at lower wattages. \u000a\u000a\u000aNow, if you want to get into rebuilding, it depends on the route you want to take. The wasp nano is VERY open on air flow, which really promotes using bigger coils, lower resistances, and higher wattages (though it is single coil). A Hadaly clone may be better suited since I hear that has tighter airflow, that way you could get a good mouth-to-lung setup going. Alternatively, the Berserker is a great MTL tank, though you'd want something like the Pico 25 so that there isn't any overhang from the atomizer. 
p252
aVMy suorin air has a terrible plastic taste!
p253
aVI couldn't disagree more. I've had zero issues with Sourin products.  I LOVE the Air v2 and the Drop isn't bad either. 
p254
aVNot everyone wants to deal with the bullshit of building coils, worrying about batteries, or carrying around a brick of a mod anymore. I've been thru all that shit over the past 4 years and am tired of it. I use a Suorin Air as my primary device and couldn't be happier. 
p255
aVYou should give the suorin drop or the smuorin air a look. I watched a couple reviews and they look like geat starter kits.
p256
aVAgreed...many reviewers give positive comments on the suorin air. It takes salt based juices.
p257
aVOh man. If you want DTL set ups (direct to lung vaping, where you drag on the device like a hookah) I'd each buy matching Voopoo Drags with matching Crown 3's.\u000a\u000aIf you want MTL (mouth to lung vaping devices, where you drag into your mouth and then inhale, like a cigarette), I'd buy 3 Suorin Airs or 3 iStick Pico's with matching Nautilus 2's.\u000a\u000a**but if you don't want to all match** here are some highly recommended atomizers and mods:\u000a\u000aMods:\u000a\u000aVoopoo Drag\u000aTesla Nano 120w\u000aSmoant Battlestar or Charon\u000aVaporesso Revenger\u000aiStick Pico\u000a\u000aAtomizers:\u000a\u000aUwell Crown 3 or Valyrian\u000aTobeco Super Tank Mini\u000aWotofo Flo Tank\u000aAspire Nautilus 2 (MTL or restricted DTL)\u000aHorizontech Arco II\u000a\u000aThe Suorin Air I mentioned is an all in one.

p258
aVPbusardo just review the suorin drop and seemed to like it.
p259
aVMaybe a pod system like the Sourin Drop or Aspire Breeze with some nic salts juice. Hardly any clouds but they will satisfy a nicotine craving. And they would be cheaply replaceable.
p260
aVGet a suorin air with some NKD salt nic juice at 50mg. I have the frost bite flavor and it is amazing, I\u2019ve also heard the brain freeze is badass as well. 
p261
aV&gt; suorin air\u000a\u000aDo you have to use their "Blow Sauce", or can I used juices I already have? I read that site top to bottom and couldn't figure that out. I guess I should have included that I would like to use the juices I have on hand instead of having to buy new ones for a unit that will only be used in an emergency. 
p262
aVYou can refill with standard ejuice. Nicotine salt based fluids just means they use nicotine salt instead of the normal, more commonly known freebase nicotine. Still the same vg/pg flavors as standard juice.\u000a\u000aCheap and popular: icare 2, aspire breeze, limitless, suorin air etc.\u000a\u000abtw all the aforementioned devices work with normal juice. all the pod systems do actually
p263
aVS.O.S. suorin air wont charge and i need nicotine
p264
aVI'm starting to wonder if Suorin is a subsidiary of Smok, but in reality pod mods break easily. It's literally better to get 2 Eleaf Icare 2 or 2 Warlock Rofvape Peas for the same money you'd spend on one of those overpriced pod mods. Ya know or just get an Innokin AIO pen or box mod and call it a day as those are usually unlikely to die until the battery does 1-2 years later.\u000a\u000aYou always have a backup.
p265
aV&gt;the same thing happened to my friend's suorin\u000a&gt;this one is a week old\u000a\u000aThat's a pretty bad failure rate. I'm sorry for your loss.
p266
aVIt's no fluke, it's suorin.\u000a\u000aOver the last weeks, posts like yours crop up quite a lot.\u000a\u000aSo the best answer to your question is "buy a vape", not a piece of crap like you've gotten saddled with. While it's not the answer you were looking for, it's the one that makes most sense.
p267
aVAll of these high airflow devices you guys reccomend ive tried, they do not hit the spot for me like the juul or suorin (when it worked)
p268
aVGet an Innokin Endura T22 kit. Fill it with 30 or 45mg salt liquid. It\u2019s a restricted airflow setup, runs at 14W, and works great. \u000a\u000aI have Juuls and a Sourin, so I know where you\u2019re coming from. The setup I just described is rock solid. Might be a little much, airflow wise,  but you can drop the nic slightly to offset that. \u000a
p269
aVI am not a dick, I am an asshole .)\u000a\u000aBut my point still stands. Just check this sub for problems with this suorin.\u000a\u000aAs for being a fog machine... Check up on MTL, no need for big clouds to get nicotine.\u000a\u000aI can understand your anger, you dished out $30 and essentially threw that money away, you could have gotten any number of MTL-atomizers for that and used your existing mod.
p270
aVThe thing is i dont care how big of a hit i get, i literally cannot get nic sick and i dont feel "harshness" from nicotine. the more the merrier. i can smoke 2 packs back to back, not trying to brag obviously just trying to show you how high my tolerance is. But if the airflow isnt tight like a cig it feels off. the suorin and juul hit *perfect* but ill probably go to the vape shop and try it out if they have it
p271
aVNobody hates salt liquid. Everyone agrees that it's an excellent option for smokers looking to quit. Favorites of this sub such as Bombies and Level Up make it. There may be a bit of a resentment growing towards these systems solely based on the amount of 15YOs coming thru here asking 'is Juul or Suorin best for getting buzzed and where can I hide it from my parents' but nobody is going to tell a quitting smoker other than to go with what works for them.
p272
aVBecause for $25 you can get a mod that perfectly simulates the draw of a cigarette with double the liquid capacity and about triple the battery capacity that'll actually last you 1 - 2 years.\u000a\u000aThe only benefit you get from a pod mod is it's as small or looks similar to a cigarette. I don't vape for how things look in my hand or how they behave like a cigarette. I vape for nicotine, to stay off cigarettes.\u000a\u000aIf I'm going to buy a pod mod it's not going to cost me an arm and a leg just to keep replacing it. If you're so willing to pay $150 then just go buy 6 more Suorin Airs and you'll solve your problems until you need 6 more.
p273
aVYa that makes sense. I was just feeling around for something like the suorin or juul bc you guys know all the new stuff and half the people are trying to sell me on a regular vape that i can guarantee i know more about than them, again not bragging it was just my hobby for so long. Pair all of this with deeply craving nicotine and sheeit
p274
aVOk so tell me the name of this mystery mod so i can buy it lol. If it really hits like the suorin then ill buy it, no brainer
p275
aVGateway back to smoking? You gotta be kidding me. when my suorin was working the last thing i wanted was a 'Port. The hit was so clean and satisfying and *real* 
p276
aVI second the recommendation of the endura. I went for the T20 instead of the 22 and only regret it because the hit is a tiny bit too airy. As for your suorin problem, i\u2019ve had 2 suorin airs and one broke because I dropped it in water and the other broke because I dropped it onto concrete from quite a few feet up. Both were my fault. If you want to try fixing the suorin, the blinking blue means that the connectors are dirty. Use a q-tip or tissue to clean it out and maybe try again. As for maintenance for the suorin, I used to take the pod out maybe twice a day and wipe off any liquid that may have leaked out to prevent the dirty connector problem. I know many people have been having problems with them but either I got lucky or I was doing something right. I know my sample size was miniscule, but both broke due to user error not an error on suorin\u2019s part. 
p277
aV&gt; Has anybody else experienced this?  ....or doing something seriously wrong when I prime?\u000a\u000aMan, the iCare *was* great when it first came out.  With each subsequent re-order I received, the quality greatly worsened to the point where even looking at the iCare would shatter the built-in glass tank.  I decided to stop carrying the iCare because of the issues you mentioned.\u000a\u000aThen I brought in the Boulder Rock.  It's still a pretty damn good device for nicotine salts, but as you mentioned, the pull and flavor could be better.  I think this has to be from the silica wick, you're just going to get that much better flavor from cotton since it is more absorbent than silica.  The Boulder Rock does solve the QA issues and also fixed the iCare's issues of constant leaking and breakage.\u000a\u000aI almost picked up the Suorin Air, before deciding to go the distance with the Kimsun Slim.  In my humble opinion, the Suorin Air is great as a novelty, but I feel the hit it gives is severly underpowered and the credit card shape feels unnatural in the hand when vaping.\u000a\u000aNow the Kimsun Slim 2R.  It's different than anything I've ever tried.  I think it's because it's the first refillable disposable pod system that uses temperature control titanium wire instead of wattage and kanthal.  The first 15-30 pulls is just pure cotton taste, and because it's not silica wick like the Juul or Boulder Rock, the burn in is longer than any other ultraportable you may have used.  Here are two tips I do to make the Kimsun better:\u000a\u000a* The pods come with two clear rubber stoppers that plug the mouthpiece and airhole.  I cut the airhole plug in half, and put it back in, to decrease the draw and increase the flavor.\u000a\u000a* Remove the two stickers on the side of the Kimsun to see your juice level better\u000a\u000a\u000aAs of right now, I think the Kimsun is the best device on the market to use to Max VG nicotine *and* 50/50 nicotine salts.  Is it perfect?  No, but we're getting there.  If and when I can find a device that provides superior flavor to the Kimsun, you bet I will carry it in the store.  \u000a\u000a\u000aLet me know what you think --
p278
aVHey Bombies!! I just purchased three After Dark flavors after switching to the Suorin Drop only a week ago and I\u2019m beyond excited to try them! \u000a\u000aUnfortunately, I am not running into the same smooth experience with my device itself. After testing various juices that I could quickly find locally, I seem to be stuck with the same issue of burning the cotton too quickly in my pods. \u000a\u000aI only switched to a mod after tiring from the Juul and its issues, and I was really hoping my solution to my troubleshooting with the Drop was just finding the right juice. \u000a\u000aI\u2019m awaiting my Bombies package to arrive, but since I managed to catch this post I was wondering if you could please advise a pod mod that I could try and snag before my juice comes? I\u2019d love to get a reliable set up working and if the Kimsun is the answer I\u2019d buy right away. I\u2019d really appreciate some insight!! Thank you.
p279
aVThe kimsun would be a good option, it's not quite mouth to lung though. I think it will probably be a little more airy than the Suorin, but in terms of it as a pod device it works great. If you want something a little less airy maybe our boulder rocks, but I think you may be pleased with the Kimsun.
p280
aVejuice is made of PG (Propylene Glycol), VG (Vegetable Glycerin), nicotine (optional), and flavoring. It is better than cigarettes because it doesn't have the thousands of chemicals and other shit that cigarettes do.\u000a\u000a\u000aIf you don't want huge clouds and just want your nicotine fix you'll want some sort of pod like the Juul, Sourin Drop, Breeze, Penguin etc. Or you can go with the AIO like the [T20 or T18](https://www.truenorthvapor.com/collections/starter-kits/endura). There are many more AIO that's just an example.

aVSuorin Drop Issue
p295
aVStandard nicotine is a freebase, meaning the outer electron shell is open and actively bonds.  This nic also leaves your system quickly and can be quite harsh.  Salt based nicotine is far closer to the form found in the plant and the outer electron shell is almost fulfilled.  (think noble gasses but not actually filled)  This leads to almost like a time release in your system, the nicotine stays longer.  It's also less harsh as noted in other comments, most companies hit it with a small amount of one of two types of acid to introduce throat hit.  I've vaped salt nic for about two years now from the juul to bottled liquids in other devices. I love it.  Typically you'll find nic strengths in 20,25,30,35,45,50 .  Always remember that these are not exactly suitable for high power applications.  I use a 25 in an ATOpack Penguin. 45's in suorin products or similar low watt, semi-closed loop devices.  
p296
aVI can suggest the Suorin Air. Its small, light weight and pretty solid. It has a 450Mah battery but with regular use it will last a solid 3 hours. It charges to full in less than 15 min so once it dies its quick to re charge. Pods arent too bad either, 4-5$ depending on where you find them, they can last upwards of two weeks depending on the juice you use. 
p297
aVI just got my Suorin Air a few days ago. So far so good! Hits really well, blows great clouds. It\u2019s sleek and very beautiful imo it\u2019s as small as a credit card and can slip right into your wallet. There\u2019s a variety of colors (I have rose gold, it\u2019s v pretty \U0001f338) would definitely recommend Suorin Air!!!
p298
aVSuorin Air is definitely a solid device, www.saltnic.com offers a combo with the device and 30ml of juice (I recommend Mango 25mg, it's delicious) for $30. Not sure if the Reddit20 code still works for 20% off or not.\u000a\u000aOtherwise go to Mt. Baker Vapor and get he Joyetech AIO for free with code FLAVORNOW, and also load it up with that mango juice. Good stuff!\u000a\u000aOh and the Innokin T20S is also an awesome device IMO.
p299
aVI really like mine. Instead of carrying around my normal set up when Im at work or on campus its a lot better then my VT200 and Herakles RTA which is rather bulky. Its also a plus because my university is smoke free which as of this semester includes any form of vaping so the Suorin is easy enough to conceal with smaller amount of vapor.

aVHi /u/_Bombies! Off your recommendation from a previous post, I just purchased a Kimsun Slim 2r. However, I had another concern, regarding all the warnings I see/hear from Nic Salt vendors to not use Nicotine Salts with sub-ohm devices.\u000a\u000a*Since the Kimsun has a 0.25ohm resistance coil, I was wondering if this falls in that category? \u000a*\u000a\u000aThe Suorin Drop, which I am currently using, claims a resistance of 1.3-1.4 ohms and is 'optimized' for Nic Salts, and another product I was looking at -- the Atopack Dolphin -- offers two MTL coils in 0.6ohm and 1.2ohm, as well as a DL 0.25ohm. /u/aWanderer01 was able to give me some feedback on his time with the Dolphin and claims the DL isn't nearly as effective as MTL (assuming 1.2ohm, and you're using Nic Salts?)\u000a\u000aSince we're talking Bombies, I was hoping you'd be able to let me know how well the juice burns in these circumstances. Is there a big difference between the Nicotine Salt 50VG/50PG versions of the After Dark line and the ~70VG/30PG versions with "freebased" nicotine in regards to sub-ohm devices -- specifically the Kimsun?\u000a\u000a

aVThe Juul will definitely work mate; the pods work out to be 59mg nicotine per ml. For ref, I managed to kill a 19 year pack a day habit on something with the same power output as the Juul and 18mg per ml. The pods are spendy tho; you can refill them but it might be a bit more fannying around than you can be bothered with. \u000a\u000aThere's a rash of pod systems out just now and also little ultraportables that you can put your own juice into. You can get bottled 50mg liquid from Mr Salt E and Level Up (I'm sure there's others by now). I don't know a whole heap about them but have a poke around for the following: ICare, Aspire Breeze, Suorin, Boulder Rock, Rofvape Peas and the Limitless...shit...Limitless wee thing that looks like a flash drive. Oh, and also /u/templetam's review of the Dolphin a couple of hours ago.

aVSuorin Air keeps firing
p307
aVAlso i was advised that when letting the device sit or turned off for periods of time, I assumed this was like over night when you are sleeping. To remove the suorin air pod(Juice conatiner) and keep it separate. Supposedly the juice and leak out of the container and leak into the inside and onto the components. So take it apart clean the insides.(By getting a flat head screwdriver and prying the plastic near the suorin logo). Then just keep the pod off the device when not being used
p308
aVSo a day later the suorin crapped out for good. Turns out theyre not made to be on 24/7 lol. Just got a new one in gold that im gonna try to keep for longer. 
p309
aVPLEASE HELP! My suorin was firing by itself and I looked at the comments above and cleaned it. IT SMELLS LIKE FIRE AND TASTES LIKE FIRE. Anyone know what I can do ? Or do I just have to buy another one? 
p310
aVSo i have just ran into an issue that I can\u2019t find a solution to. My suorin air keeps firing even while it\u2019s turned off and so I need to remove the pod from further heating. But when I turn it on the blue or red malfunction light flashes sowley, but when I turn it off there are blue and red lighted blinking very quick just like a strobe light would... do I need to replace the whole thing or is there a fix I\u2019m missing? And extra thing, my sensor is in poor condition. Are there replacement firing sensors anywhere?
p311
aVHonestly with all the issues you just posted I'd buy another suorin. Another thing you could try is pushing out the device from its case and cleaning the juice off of it, you do that by pushing on the inside part where you'd normally put your pod and it comes out. Are you leaving your pods in for an extended period of time? The juice is most likely leaking from the pod and into your device overnight 
p312
aVI just read what his problem was and it was exactly like mine but I was gonna have to go with that solution of buying another sourin. 
p313
aVI\u2019m just getting a new sourin. 
p314
aVDriptech TS, about 800ml of juice from CVC, GSV, B-X, Double Comma, and some Naked. Also got some n80 fused clapton wire and some Native Wicks Platinum from Lightning Vapes. And then 3 new Samsung 25Rs for the Driptech.\u000a\u000aThen I got my wife 3 bottles of Tropical Mango from www.saltnic.com along with the free Joyetech AIO from MBV. She actually likes that thing more than the Innokin T20S I got her, and the Suorin Air. She likes it so much that she ordered a backup one yesterday, using the same coupon code.

aVBig ups to the G-Jeff for popping on here. Not only am I a G-Jeff too, but I love the customer service!\u000a\u000aI've been loving the salt nic/pod vape after having come for circle after six years of vaping. Enough so that I don't even know where my vaporesso revenger is right now; it's been months.\u000a\u000aMy Aspire Breeze has gotten to the point that I'm charging it several times a day, I lost my MyJet and my Suorin Drop stopped working after a brief two weeks of use. Today I finally decided to go for a replacement. After calling a few shops, who all advocated for the Drop, I found a shop that was bonkers for the MiPod. \u000a\u000aI'd rather roll the dice on something new than risk further disappointment with another Drop, so I decided to swing by and give the MiPod a shot (after ruling out the Roll Badge and Infinix from SMOK).\u000a\u000aIt's only been 12 hours, but here are my quick thoughts...\u000a\u000a- crazy lightweight\u000a- freakishly sturdy for it's plasticness\u000a- I keep expecting it to die, but it's still indicating 3.7v!!! How can that be???\u000a- flavor is great and the vape is on the warm side, which I love!\u000a- possible leaking issues when laid on side for a while... I've had two juicy hits that were gross\u000a- it does get warm on one side of the pod... bothersomely so, but, I just put my lips around the box itself and all is good\u000a- best airflow ever! great lung hits without feeling like you're stressing an MTL device\u000a- love stealth mode\u000a- seriously...the LED is still bright blue! Is it broken? Will it last forever? Who knows?!?
p321
aVI'm sick of juul. Was going to get a sourin drop with all the hype, but just found mipod. I did find some bad reviews about quality just now though. \u000a\u000a3 weeks later, you still big on mi pod over sourin?\u000aAnything that I can refill my own pods would be great. Sick of juul quality and brown cartiridges...

aVSuorin Drop
p330
aVThe Suorin Drop is made for nic salts.   
p331
aVYou can add whatever you like - because salts are generally higher mg, it's not recommended to use them in big chunky setups, lower power devices like the Suorin and Juul and whatnot are ideal. If you're using 'traditional' juices, stay around 50/50 to 65VG/35PG - much higher VG than that and shit gets to thick to wick and vaporize effectively because the device doesn't have enough grunt.
p332
aVOnce it starts to taste burnt. Suorin says 5 refills but i've gotten many more than that out of a pod.
p333

aVSuorin Air Burnt Taste
p339
aVThe Suorin Air pods are unfortunately very susceptible to burnt cotton if you don't allow the juice to soak in for about 5-10 minutes before using them.  I've gone through quite a few pods myself and unfortunately, once they're burnt...they're burnt.      \u000a\u000aThe best practice I've found is to get a new pod, fill it with the juice of your choice and allow it to sit for approximately 10 minutes before hitting it.  During those 10 minutes, I'll do a few pulls on the cartridge itself to assist with pulling the juice into the cotton.  That seems to work and I haven't had any burnt pods since I started doing it like this. 
p340
aVYep. I solved this issue. Go to you tube and search a video called Suorin Air Hack with a Hawaiian guy. Basically what you so is take the tiny metal tab that us between the contacts on the pods off with your finger nail and it will increase the Airflow and stop the burnt taste. Also make sure you let them wick with new juice a good 30 min.  My pods last a week to 10 days now. 
p341
aVIf you want something REALLY small, I'd recommend the Suorin Air or Suorin Drop...but those are made to be used with nicotine salts, so not sure if you're into that.  If you want a sub-ohm type setup, maybe something like the Priv v8 kit that's a single 18650 setup in a compact form factor.

aVSuorin Air Over(?)firing
p347
aVI am currently on my 3rd Suorin Air.  The past 2 started overfiring after about 4 months of use.  I suspect this one will start over firing as well eventually.  When that happens I'm switching to the Innokin EQ.  \u000a\u000aI would always turn the switch to 'OFF'" after taking a drag to prevent continuous firing.  I don't think it's a safety issue per say, but that extra firing after it leaves your lips will burn out the cotton faster.  I would suggest replacing it, and turning it off after taking a drag in the interim.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aLike most chinese companies, Suorin products are cheaply made in bulk with little quality assurance.  Their customer service is crap as well.., they truly don't care (because they are still making a nice profit.)
p348
aVThanks for your reply. I actually thought it might be a safety concern since it was the first time it did it... Suorin is a Chinese brand? I thought it was Korean! :( It's such a nice product but you're right, if this happened on my almsot 3rd month of use then yeah their QA sucks. But then again, you get the $20 you paid for I guess...
