VGet a juul you'll thank me later
p1
aVSome of my friends have been using this e-cigarette called juul,  I figured that I may be tempted to try that.  If I tell them I quit they'll be respectful,  of that I'm sure.  I'll definitely take it easy on the drinks, I'll probably come back to this post during my time there.  
p2
aVDay two using the new Juul vape from Pax
p3
aVI wouldn't use the word cheap, but it's very lightweight (weighs less than a BIC lighter) and if you really wanted to you could probably break it in half. I like it because it fits in my jean pocket and even in the little key pocket in my workout pants. I've already stepped on it once or twice and it's fine. Most of it is the battery anyway.\u000a\u000aI'll admit I've gotten some weird looks because pretty much every ecig either looks like a cigarette or it's one of those big tubey contraptions. The Juul looks more like something you'd use to smoke weed (though I live in San Francisco so most people ignore that anyway).\u000a\u000aI'm still going strong today. So far it's been well worth the $50 for the vape and the cartridges.
p4
aVYeah for me I've quit smoking more times than I can count, and now it's only been 3 days without a cigarette but the juul hit the spot whenever I have a craving. I really do enjoy it more than other e cigarettes I have tried. (Blu, enjoy, anything else you pickup at a gas station). Hopefully this will help me kick it for good this time. 
p5
aVGood on you for quitting, if you're picking up an E-cig then I'd get a Juul.  I've tried everything and most ecigs just make me go back to smoking.  The juul gives me the same buzz I got from when I started smoking.  
p6
aVI started vaping, and will be moving to no nicotine soon. I had smoked for 23 years and tried everything to quit and couldn't. My friend bought me a juul and I started to wean myself off cigarettes that way. It's been 4 months and so many benefits have kicked in. At first it was nice to walk down the street and not be an inconvenience to others while smoking, not smell like smoke all the time. Now it just started raining and I'm so excited that I don't need to go through the whole winter smoker hassles of standing in the cold and rain, etc. If you cant find yourself quitting with other methods, I would check out the juul. It's small, is satisfying, feels good in your hand, and doesn't do the big cloudy thing. I also got a bunch of apps like Kwit and MyLastCigarette so I could track how many cigarettes I haven't smoked. I'm at about 2,200 now. My goal is no nicotine, but I am okay with using this as a stepping stone since it allowed me to see how impactful the benefits of not smoking can be.
p7
aVI don't know your views on e-cigarettes as a cessation tool, but I was in the same boat - alcohol was too powerful a trigger, so every time I drank, I'd smoke. Didn't want to stop drinking, so I bought a Juul e-cig and never looked back. My badge is busted, but my wife and I just celebrated one month tobacco-free and we've been drinking/partying as much as we want.\u000a\u000aIf e-cigs are "cheating" to you (or you don't want to substitute tobacco for vaping), you might have to lay off the drinks until your confidence/willpower improves. If not, I'd strongly recommend vaping when you drink. \u000a\u000aGood luck!
p8
aVI quit on Sunday. I am using a JUUL, so I am definitely not needing nicotine like I did when I quit cold turkey in 2011, but here is some stuff that worked/is working for me for the behavioral part on my addiction:\u000a\u000a\u2022Every time I want a cigarette (a real one, in this case) I literally out run the craving. Because I ran, I feel good about myself *and* I get a sweet, sweet endorphin rush. Running is my go-to replacement behavior, since it fills a lot of the same need in me that smoking does.\u000a\u2022I downloaded a quit smoking app called "Smoke Free". It's a free app that gives you missions (for a one time $4.99 payment) and free enforcement for not smoking. It tells you how much money you have saved, how many days of your life you got back, and gives good encouragement. I feel good when I look at it, as if every minute I'm not smoking I am winning.\u000a\u2022My car is a huge trigger for me, so today I detailed it. I put a lot of effort into it, and it smells pretty good. That's a good feeling. Also, I smell pretty good. Also a good feeling.\u000a\u000aGood luck! You can do this.
p9
aVDo you guys count using e cigs as quiting? Or does this community prefer cold turkey\u000a\u000aI just bought a juul e cig..  love it by the way! I'm just curious if people count this a cheating thanks! Currently at 4 hours lol
p10
aVWhat do you guys think of vape products and cigarette substitutes like the juul. Need opinions. Comments are appreciated!\u000a\u000aI've always been an on and off smoker and recently I purchased a juul. It's helped me abstain from tobacco use because I still get my nicotine fix. Was wondering what you guys think about substitutes such as nicotine gum and vapes etc. do they help. Would you guys rather quit cold turkey? Thank you! 
p11
aVTrying to quit the juul\u000a\u000aI know this isn't traditional analog cigarettes but I got myself addicted to the juul and basically just any nicotine over the summer. At first it was hella fun and felt soo good. Unfortunately as it always goes it soon became necessary and although withdrawal is no where near agonizing it's just the cravings that get to me. Like I don't want to do shit until I get a fix and I always regret doing it at night when I'm sleeping like "fuck man I should have just not hit it". It's this insanely frustrating cycle and whenever I crave it all rational goes out the window and I just have that fuck it mentality where I don't care. Was there anything you guys found to be especially helpful to just keep yourself from using nicotine? I have only been hooked for about 4 months but I feel like if I don't stop soon I'm never gonna quit and it really scares me cause I'm only 18 and I don't wanna be stuck doing this shit forever ya know?
p12
aVNon Nicotine Vapes\u000a\u000aIt took me a long time to find a vape I actually like, in my case, the Juul.  However, I have to stop taking nicotine for medical reasons.  I can't for the life of me find a non nicotine vape that is quality.  Anyone have any suggestions? 
p13
aVI think you might be better off just refilling the Juul Pods with Non-Nic juice.
p14
aVI figured since Juul doesn't make non-nic juice that wasn't going to be feasible.  I'll look into it.
p15
aVCongratulations! I\u2019ve been vaping &amp; not smoking cigs, but I feel like I am vaping way more than I was smoking - easier to conceal! Quit date set for 12/31, but maybe I should just throw Juul away today. 
p16
aVThose juuls have the highest concentration of nicotine of any other nrt or tobacco product. Toss it as soon as possible. 
p17
aVJuul fiend\u000a\u000aA few months ago one of my close friends bought a juul. She  ended up using very heavily and tried to quit unsuccessful a couple times. Eventually she gave me her juul to keep safe and to help her quit. Luckily I have been on vacation with the juul safe at home, so I have had a good excuse when she's texting me asking for it back. She now is convinced shes over her addiction and will be able to use the Juul with self control and not allow it to control her life. Is she right? Or is her habit going to get back to where it was before she quit if she starts again? What should I tell her?
p18
aVToday\u2019s the day I set out on my new journey...\u000a\u000aCouple weeks ago I decided it was time for me to quit due to so many reasons and I choose 12/18 to be my quit date and I\u2019m actually really excited to fully quit smoking cigs. I don\u2019t like them, especially the smell from them and don\u2019t know why I even got myself into them. It\u2019s been over a year of me smoking them and I usually can smoke between a couple cigs to half a pack or more in a day and last night I had my last cig. I\u2019m hoping my vape and Juul will help me with NRT, but I\u2019m not sure if I wanna continue using the juul also. Might wanna quit that too due to the nicotine salt. Just looking for some support and help through this because I know I can quit, my mom smoked 30+ years and quit so I believe I can do this!
p19
aVQuitting vaping?\u000a\u000aI hope this is the right community but it seems to be the best bet since there\u2019s no /r/stopvaping! I\u2019ve never smoked regularly (aside from a few cigarettes bummed off friends), but I have been addicted to nicotine for about 6 months due to me stupidly buying a juul to fit in with the trends. I was recently informed of some medical reasons that might make nicotine affect me more negatively than most, and decided it would probably be best to stop.\u000a\u000aI tried cold turkey for a few days and it wasn\u2019t that hard, but I quickly lost motivation and went back. For me, the physical cravings weren\u2019t that bad, it was more of the routine of vaping that kept bugging me. Hitting my weed vape helped a lot, but obviously I don\u2019t want to be high 24/7 so I can\u2019t always use that.\u000a\u000aSo I was wondering from anyone who has quit or tried to quit vaping: would it be worth buying a Suorin with 0mg nicotine juice to maintain the routine of vaping while still going \u201ccold turkey\u201d from nicotine? Or will that lead to additional problems that a full quit wouldn\u2019t create?\u000a\u000aI know I could taper nic levels but I\u2019d rather get it over with quickly, so I\u2019m kinda set on a 0 nicotine path forward. I\u2019m also aware of the dangers of inhaling any particulate, and I do eventually intend to stop vaping altogether, but my immediate medical need is to stop nicotine. So I\u2019m just wondering if anyone has tried going straight to 0mg juice and if it\u2019s easier than no vaping at all.\u000a\u000aThanks!!
p20
aVDay 1\u000a\u000aBeen using the Juul for a year now, and was going through a pod a day (equal to one pack a day). Today was my first day without it. I'm scared but ready for this.
p21
aVI fucked around and got addicted to nicotine. Send help.\u000a\u000aSo this kid in my class bought me a juul (for those that don\u2019t know it\u2019s an e cigarette) a couple of months ago for no reason....  anyway at first I told myself I\u2019d only use it when I was drinking but then I liked the buzz and started doing it almost everyday and now I smoke it all the time. I threw it away a week ago so I\u2019d stop but I couldn\u2019t control myself and bought one again and now I know for sure I\u2019m addicted to nicotine and don\u2019t know what to do. How do people stop? I know cigarette smokers smoke e cigs or vapes when they\u2019re trying to get rip of smoking but I\u2019ve never smoked cigs just the e cig what\u2019s the best thing to use in replacement of the e cig as I slowly try take myself away from nicotine? Or any advice? 
p22
aVI'm replying with the benefit of seeing other comments and your replies.\u000a\u000aNicotine addiction has a physical side and a mental side.  Both are serious; both need to be overcome.  Since you can go days without your addiction is like 90% mental.   Don't discount the risk of that.  I smoked only on weekends when I was out for at least a year.  Then I was so addicted, I smoked for twenty years hating myself for it.  It sneaks up on you. \u000a\u000a&gt; any advice?\u000a\u000aRead [this chapter of an e-book (pdf)](http://whyquit.com/FFN/chapters/FFN_11_Subconscious.pdf).   It is about how nicotine is working it's addiction magic even now.  Hopefully it will help your conscious mind realize why any nicotine is too much.\u000a\u000aYou might try getting a zero nicotine vape.  I found the breathing ritual (puff, hold, long exhale) kind of soothing.  I think the JUUL is a nicotine addiction device:  it has no way to control the nicotine level.\u000a\u000aNow is a great time to be quitting.  I wish I had quit as early as you.\u000a\u000a\u000a
p23
aVNicotine withdrawal?\u000a\u000aHey everyone, I have a few questions regarding nicotine withdrawal.\u000a\u000aSo I used to be addicted to cigs but quit that and substituted it for even higher nicotine electric cigarettes, like juul or  phix. I went from hitting one a few times a day to burning through pods in 2-3 days on some occasions (4 juul pods = 1 pack of cigs, 4 phix pods = 2 packs of cigs). Both were about 50mg nicotine. After I stopped getting buzzes I moved onto breezes which hit so much harsher and had such a better headrush. \u000a\u000aWell, anyways, now i've gone cold turkey to all nicotine products. I'm on my 5th day and for now doing good but i was craving nicotine so much it was insane. I never acknowledged how addicted I was until I tried to kick it and it's been near impossible. How long will these cravings last? Thanks for any advice
p24
aVJuul addiction\u000a\u000aSo, if you don't know, there's a huge trend of e-cigarettes going around called juuls. These things are nuts with 24 mg of nicotine in each "pod" which is the size of the tip of your thumb. I have been using this thing for a good 4 months quite excessively, and I cannot make myself stop. I've tried quitting cold turkey, but the cravings were much too strong. I was gonna ask for some suggestions on how I should go about quitting. Is nicotine gum a good idea for someone like me who can't quit cold turkey? Any feedback is welcomed, thank you very much :)
p25
aVI\u2019m hooked on these things too! It\u2019s been a blessing and a curse. On one hand it\u2019s great not smoking a pack of stinking tar filled cigarettes a day. On the other, I find myself using these things ALL THE TIME. \u000a\u000aI\u2019m hooked just as bad as I was on cigarettes but I keep telling myself at least it\u2019s not as bad for me. Prior to this I was using a \u201ccompact\u201d sub ohm vape which I found annoying to maintain, way more bulky to carry, and not nearly as satisfying. I\u2019m convinced these juuls are the best harm reduction strategy I\u2019ve got right now but I recognize that I\u2019m a slave to them and know that I need to stop what I\u2019m doing to myself.\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve been working on mentally preparing for my next quit attempt. I\u2019m way more mindful of how I feel after not having used and understand that the anxiety during withdrawal is a product of the addiction. For my next attempt I\u2019m going to avoid nicotine replacement since that seems to just prolong the suffering, Chantix because it makes me kind of insane, and just let my brain heal on its own cold turkey. It\u2019s going to suck for a little while but I think that\u2019s probably the quickest way through.
p26
aVHey I am in the kinda same boat as you are, I'm done smoking cigarettes but the next step would to get off of using the juul as well. I had two juuls and used them for about three months before I decided to give it up and go cold turkey this weekend. It's tough but I know I can pull through. A small suggestion from a friend was to taper off the juul, but I don't see how you can as PAX labs only sells 5% nic pods. I suggest that you try diluting your pods with a 0 nicotine juice so you would be getting less nic. Like maybe use two pods until halfway then fill the rest up with 0 mic juice. The throat hit probably won't be the same, but there will still be nic. I quit using the juul because my throat would be sore all the time, and cutting it cold turkey would help me the most. Last thursday I woke up with the worst pain in my throat, it was a common occurrence like every other week, but this was the worst. If you have trouble on refilling pods/diluting them, give it a google, it's fairly easy and you can get a couple extra uses out of those pods. I've been off the juul and vapes since sunday and my throat still feels horrible. Good luck to you and OP! You can do this!
p27
aVDude fucking dump the juul asap. I started smoking it around august and it was actually causing me to have mild panic attacks. Eventually I picked up a full blown addiction at 1-1.5 pods a day. The panic attacks were so bad that I had to get an ekg to make sure I didn't have atrial fibrillation. I quit cold turkey right before thanksgiving and man it was tough but I left it back at school while I was home so that helped and once I passed through the first week of withdrawal it started getting better.\u000a\u000aI'm serious when I say this: get rid of it now.
p28
aVi literally flushed my juul down the toilet about a week ago. The withdrawal symptoms are hell right now, but its slowly getting better. trust me after the third or fourth day it slowly starts getting better
p29
aVSmoker for 5 years, finally managed to successfully quit (again)\u000a\u000aHi guys, so I\u2019ve been smoking since 16(yeah I know, don\u2019t remind me) it\u2019s been fairly intermittent but I\u2019ve always smoked. Since 2 years ago I\u2019ve been a pretty regular smoker and managed to quit for several months after I hit the pack a day mark. As my smoking has gotten back to the concerning level ( &gt;1/2ppd) I\u2019ve decided to quit again.  I\u2019m also significantly reducing the amount of smokeless I use. \u000a\u000aThe thing that\u2019s helped me greatly is a JUUL. It doesn\u2019t feel like a vape. It\u2019s easy. It actually feels the most like smoking that isn\u2019t smoking. I highly recommend it. Seriously. I\u2019ve had 5 cigarettes in the past 3 weeks and those were at the bar and at the beginning. \u000a\u000aI have never felt so confident that I\u2019m stopping smoking before.  My dipping has even reduced significantly. And I\u2019m using my JUUL much less than I smoked to begin with. \u000a\u000aIt can be done, I\u2019m doing it. If you\u2019re struggling with cravings and the need for nicotine. I recommend a JUUL. \u000aIf you don\u2019t want any inhalation at all, I recommend snus. \u000aSnus helped me quit the first time and if shipping from Sweden wasn\u2019t so much I\u2019d still regularly snus. \u000a\u000aJust my .02, figured it could help someone else. 
p30
aVI\u2019ve heard about the vapes. Are they better for you? I know they aren\u2019t necessarily \u201cgood\u201d for you because our lungs aren\u2019t meant for anything besides oxygen. But I\ufe0fm considering getting the \u201cjuul\u201d vape because it\u2019s so tiny. My friend has one and i really enjoy hitting I\u200et because it\u2019s small enough to feel like a real cigarette. Also, what about starting out with nicotine, then going down on the mg, eventually getting to 0mg? 
p31
aVI Lost My Juul and I\u2019m Tempted to go buy a Phix\u000a\u000a
p32
aVHey bro, you're just like me. I'm 21 and I was also smoking since 13. I quit cigarettes 3 months ago and I quit the Juul 4 days ago. We got this mate!!! Don't give up!!!!
p33
aVSo I stopped smoking cigarettes for 2 days but I caved in and bought a Juul, is this habit just as bad as smoking? Many sources say it's not bad for you but I feel like it is. Any advise?\u000a\u000a
p34
aVI like to think it is not as bad as smoking but my problem with the Juul specifically was the high nicotine content. It was great first thing in the morning to buzz right outta bed with it. but I started to get concerned about the high nicotine levels so I eventually went back to cigs thinking they were better because the nicotine content was lower (not smart). When I quit smoking again (currently at over a month now) I went with an e cig that has differences in nicotine strength so I can step myself down to nothing eventually. 
p35
aVOpinions on Juul for quitting cigarettes\u000a\u000aI have been a smoker for over 5 years now and have never tried to quit before. I have been strongly considering switching to a Juul and giving up the real thing. One of my roomates has a Juul and I find that when he lets me take a puff or two my urge to smoke the real thing disappears. I was wondering if anyone who switched to Juul found it affective? It is the first e-cigarette that I have ever considered purchasing as most e-cigarettes don't do it for me. Would love some helpful advice/opinions. 
p36
aVI just quit last week, first time i have ever given it a real shot and i have been smoking a pack a day for about 20 years.  Yesterday was the first time i have not had 1 cig the whole day.  I am chain using my Juul however.  That said it has been the only device i have found that works as a replacement.  I even find im fine using it while drinking instead of analogs.
p37
aVActually there is a huge difference in the case of the juul. It is much more cigarette like in its buzz, normal e cigs have freebased nicotine while the juul uses a mix of salt based nicotine mixed with benzoic acid derived from tobacco which makes the buzz hit you 20 times faster than traditional e cigs but wears off faster. \u000a\u000aAll in all it is bad since it would make you more addicted to nicotine. 
p38
aVPractice with  JUUL.
p39
aVI wanted to quit smoking and chewing tobacco,  i bought a JUUL vape, one of the highest nicotine containing vapes out there, and i really like it. If you suck on it long enough, you will buzz, however i am so inundated with nicotine that it essentially keepa nicotine levels in my plasma up, reducing the urge to smoke. If your method is not working, i would suggest a JUUL because i think it is one of the better investments i have made in my life. (21M, average nicotine consumption of 1.5 juul pods a day or around 62mg of nicotone a day)
p40
aVDAY 3\u000a\u000aGuys I smoke the Juul all day but I do not touch cigs\u000a\u000aI will wean off this nicotine craving eventually
p41
aVDAY 2\u000a\u000aI just got a Juul and I think this is gonna be the run where I quit cigarettes. Day two and feeling super strong. Check in with you guys in a week.
p42
aVBe careful, juul has a lot of nicotine. I went down the same path and found myself using 2 cartridges a day.\u000a \u000aSave yourself the trouble a smash it into the pavement like I did. 
p43
aVAre you still doing herbs with your hasj? Would you recommend it? I am not smoking cigs, but did start to vap w/ Juul again, which as you know has the nicotine. Planning to quit vaping 12/31 \U0001f49c
p44
aVnervous for my health\u000a\u000aI've never posted on reddit before, so I'm not sure if I'm posting in the right spot but whatever. I just need some answers for some questions after scaring the shit out of myself from looking at anti smoking commercials.\u000a\u000aI will currently not disclose my current age however, at the age of 14 I started to smoke(cigs,vaping,hookah) as well as another array of substances I should not be doing. My question is just if I have really only smoked about less than 3 packs of cigarettes in my life, will it affect me in the future? \u000a\u000aI currently vape out of devices such as a Juul or Phix so I'm not sure if this will still make me prone to things such as cancer, but I have completely stopped smoking cigarettes.\u000a\u000a
p45
aVThank you! You can do it!!! You'll need a bit of will power but don't do it until you feel ready. I bought a nicotine replacement, the Juul vape which has a low percent but really helps when you have cravings. I think it was a good transition for me but everyone is different. Best of luck to you! 
p46
aVNicotine replacement helps for some people. I\u2019ve got almost 3 weeks with the help of a Juul vape. It\u2019s surprisingly close to smoking a cigarette without the awful side affects (stinky, bad for you ect) I was never able to quit because I have like zero self control. When I see my friends smoking, I feel left out if I\u2019m not smoking too.  I can still be included in the smokers circle without actually having to light up! Something to think about. It may work for you too!
p47
aVNeed some encouragement\u000a\u000aHey guys. I\u2019ve got 2 weeks and 2 days under my belt. Things have been going really good for the most part. Yesterday I forgot my charger for my Juul, I had the opportunity to smoke a cigarette and  reluctantly declined. It\u2019s weird. I really want to have another cig but I also REALLY don\u2019t.  Anyways I was struggling all day. Moody. Anxious. Then I went to talk with my good friend and was really let down when she didn\u2019t show any support. I told her how I almost had one and had been having cravings the last few days. Her response was \u201cdo you want one?\u201d And I told her I\u2019m really serious about quitting. She responded \u201c oh lol I thought you broke  already\u201d \u000aIdk. I just needed to vent. I\u2019m really upset about that. Because if the roles were shifted. I\u2019d be more supportive and not offer someone who\u2019s struggling one of their vices. \u000astill haven\u2019t had a cigarette. Just taking it all one day at a time!
p48
aV7.5 years of smoking, coming up on 2 weeks without a cigarette\u000a\u000aI know 2 weeks isn\u2019t too long. But they do say once you make it past the 7 day mark, it gets easier. Now I\u2019m not perfect. I haven\u2019t completely stopped smoking. I don\u2019t smoke cigarettes anymore. But I do use a nicotine vape. If this violates the rules for not smoking. Please (kindly) inform me in the comments. I just wanted to put this out here. Because I seriously can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t picked one up. I always have opportunity to smoke. Everyone at the automotive shop I work at smokes. All my good friends smoke. My biggest hurdle was getting over the urge to smoke a cigarette in the car. Something about smoking and listening to music while you drive really feels good to me. \u000aSo two weeks ago. I literally had no plans to quit. I didn\u2019t see any issue with my smoking. And if I did, I tucked it in the back on my mind. I\u2019d tried to quit numerous times, and never made it past 3 days. Anyways. My friend introduced me to the Juul device and I quit smoking that day. I bought a brand new pack, but never opened it. Because the juul was almost equivalent to smoking (without the nasty smell and harsh chemicals) so I\u2019m here to say to pat myself on the back. My goal is to completely eliminate the vape. But I\u2019m taking things one day at a time! Congrats to everyone who has overcome this addiction and I pray you find strength in every day you are cigarette free!
p49
aVTry the juul or ephix. They use a different type of nicotine. Which, is a nicotine salt and binds much more like an actual cigarette does to receptor sites. I like the ephix more simply because it feels sturdier and holds more juice. 
p50
aVI've seen good reviews about Juul on the e-cig subs as well. I'll give that brand a shot first since there is a local convenience store that carries it.\u000a\u000aThanks for the tip!
p51
aVI highly recommend the juul, much stronger than the typical blu ecigs, and a couple more flavors as well. I quit starting with a vape mod, bulky and always refilling juices, it wasn't strong enough in nicotine so I went back to cigs a couple times. But after I got the juul, my cravings for cigarettes are basically gone. What's better is that I used a pod (juul cartridge) a day and now I go through one every 2-3 days. And it's been about three weeks. \u000aYou may be able to find one at your local head shop but I suggest getting one online if that doesn't work out. \u000a\u000aGood luck! You got this!\u000a

aVPAX JUUL helped me quit. First few weeks I smoked it a lot but it was much easier to quit than the cigarettes, and once your brain dissociates the taste and routine of the cigarettes with the nicotine, I\u2019ve found I don\u2019t even find them appealing anymore. Smoke the JUUL from time to time especially if I drink, but much better than the cigarettes. 
p53
aVQuit smoking about 3 months ago and switched to ECig and quit that too however...\u000a\u000aI have quit cigarettes and do not miss them at all. However, I switched to a Juul E Cigarette to help me off the nicotine addiction and quit that too but can't really say I quit per se. My friends have Juuls and every so often when I'm with them they will let me hit them. My question to you guys is will this fuck me up and make me crave nicotine again just as bad? Like if I don't smoke an E Cigarette for a month and then take a few hits from my friends will that nicotine addiction/withdrawals come back the same as one I originally quit?
p54
aVHello my vaping replacement friend! I have a Juul and a vape pen. I'm 4w 3d cig free. Keep up the good work!
p55
aVI made it 4 weeks as of yesterday. I did it through vaping as a replacement. I have a pen and a Juul. I'm going to reduce the nicotine in my juice every time I need a new bottle, but the Juul can't lower the levels. I'm so fucking proud of myself for finding a way to quit cigarettes!\u000a\u000a
p56
aVYou go! The juul helps me a lot although I still have the occasional cigarette. I need to cut it out though I end up regretting smoking them every time. 
p57
aVIt's a god damn beast. I like my Juul, but I hate that it doesn't come with lower nicotine cartridges. I'm going to have to give that one up at some point
p58
aVVape, specifically a Juul, they are 34.99 now. You just need someone who is 21+ to order you one... or a vape... start at 12 mg... you really get a nice throat hit
p59
aVI still vape after quitting but now I don't use a big mod. I use a juul. It's very satisfying and I don't feel all clogged up like I did with smoking
p60
aVI need help quitting nicotine.\u000a\u000aI tried cigarettes and I quit then easily I couldn't stand the smell but I switched to vape a little one like a Juul but it's called a phix, has a shit ton of nicotine loaded and it gets me so buzzed to the point I'm numb or can't drive. Been like 8 months on this and still works great, never really tried to stop but I know I can't because I'm always like I just want a little buzz it's okay. \u000a\u000aIt's gotten so bad, I don't want this to be my lifestyle and I literally can't go a day without getting atleast a big buzz in morning, 3 throughout the day and a shitton at night. What do I do what are ways I can stop because it's so fucking hard I get headaches and feel like shit. I am really trapped. Help me please. 
p61
aVI have, went from pack and half a day to using the Juul ecig for 3-4weeks, was planning on switching to nicotine gum after but didn't think it was necessary and stopped after 3-4 peices. This was about 6 months ago.\u000a\u000aPeople love to say it's impossible because they couldn't do it. Prove them wrong.
p62
aVThe logic pro kit is $35 and then you can get a 3 pack of cherry cartridges for $9-$14 depending on the store.  They don't make nicotine free though. \u000a\u000aAnother pen type ecig that is reasonably priced is the Juul and they have sweet flavors like mango. I do not know if they make a nicotine free one though. \u000a\u000aIf you are willing to buy online Halo is a company that makes e-juice with no nicotine and they have several inexpensive options https://www.halocigs.com/e-liquid/
p63
aVMy friends and I are all really addicted to these mini e-ciggs called juuls. I was the first one out of my group of friends who was able to be able to quit. After using the the app to motivate me,all 5 of my friends are following in my footsteps. We destroyed $250 worth of juuls on a trail yesterday
p64
aVThe nausea.\u000a\u000aHey all.  I've been using a Juul and smoking weed consistently for almost a year now.  I'll run through about 3/4 of a pod daily (which is about 15-16 cigs in terms of nicotine.)  I'm currently on my 5th day of a one week trip to Aruba, which I figured I would use as an opportunity to distract myself for the first week of detox.  I'm quitting nicotine cold turkey permanently and taking a week long break from weed just for the duration of my stay.  On the second night, I buckled and had a single cigarette in a bar.  My question is about the nausea that comes with the initial detox:  when the fuck will it ever stop?  I haven't been able to go out since that night.  As soon as I find myself having a drink or getting ready to go out, the nausea and acid reflux hits me like a sack of bricks, and I find myself pacing along the beach to relieve it.  I heard the nausea would persist only for 72 hours, but its been far longer.  Could that single cigarette have completely reset my timer for detox?  I'm in hell and I just want this feeling to end.
p65
aVHow long does addiction take? I have no addiction.\u000a\u000aI started smoking e cig one specifically called a Juul for about 8 months now. 3 weeks ago I decided to stop because the cartridges costed too much money and I used them fast. About one cart every 3 days and one cart is equal to a pack of cigarettes it says on the website. So when I stopped that it was a little hard but 3 weeks later and I'm completely off it and have no desire. \u000a\u000aI started smoking real cigarettes right after I quit the e cig and stoped those about 4 days ago because I couldn't stand the smell on my clothes, car, breathe, etc. I never had any cravings or anything. I haven't had e cig or a real cig for a while and I am wondering if I should have some cravings at this point. \u000a\u000aAre some people not able to get addicted? Or does it take a longer amount of time? I'm so confused cause everywhere it says the addiction is sooo strong and almost impossible to stop yet I stopped just like anyone who doesn't smoke. 
p66
aVCurrently hoping I didn't screw myself with an e-cigarette\u000a\u000aI stopped smoking cigarettes probably about a year ago, after trying out an e-cig that a friend of mine was using, the Juul. Since then I've been surgically attached to the thing. I'm approaching about the equivalent of 2 packs of cigarettes a day, taking a puff or two off of it nearly every five minutes. I just left my house, and before I left I think I lost it. I'm planning on returning and not looking for it. This thing just kicks my ass so god damn hard that I'm afraid it's impossible, that I've passed the point of no return, where it is so married into my life and everything that I do every second of every day that there's simply no way I'm going to be able to kick it. Has anyone here gone through anything similar when quitting? Any advice?\u000a\u000aThanks!
p67
aVGet a juul to help quit. Not unhealthy unless you take in ridiculous amounts of nicotine (bad for the heart) and will stop a lot of the cravings
p68
aVYep, it sure does - if you want it to.\u000a\u000aI've been tobacco-free for 203 days now, and I feel so much better. I switched to e-cigs right as I quit tobacco (first the Juul, now the Von Erl), and I don't regret it in the slightest. \u000a\u000aYes, e-cigs often have more nicotine, and some purists might not think it "counts" because you're still consuming nicotine, but fuck that noise. E-cigs, to me, are a totally viable quitting aid, and you're better off vaping than smoking tobacco cigarettes. Keep going!
p69
aVYou should check out www.juulvapor.com\u000a\u000aI haven't touched a cigarette in 3 months since I bought this thing. Basically, it's an e-cigarette that uses disposable, high-nicotine leveled cartridges. The juice in them is composed of nicotine salts, rather than the freebase nicotine found in most, if not all, e-juices nowadays. This makes the buzz, throat hit, and vapor production feel much more like a cigarette draw.\u000a\u000aFrom the website:\u000a&gt;"JUUL uses nicotine salts that are found in the tobacco leaf, rather than free-base nicotine, and is designed to produce consistent, quality vapor." ; "Nicotine content: 0.7mL with 5% nicotine by weight (59 mg/mL per pod, ~ content of a pack of cigarettes)."\u000a\u000aAs of right now, they come in mint, fruit, tobacco, mango, and creme brulé flavors; a lot of new flavors and lower nicotine levels are expected to be released soon. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNow, the thing about these devices is that they are quite addictive and the fact that they produce low amounts of vapor allows them to be used pretty much anywhere, I try to not go over a pod every 2 days, but sometimes I go 1 a day which is like smoking a pack a day...\u000a\u000aSo yeah, mixed feelings about it, but I can vouch for how effective it is for quitting cigs.
p70
aVYeah I'm more looking for something that is gonna help me quit smoking entirely not just replace cigarettes. With the oils I can reduce the amount of nicotine intake so hopefully I don't smoke anything. If juul does release lower nicotine options maybe it's something worth trying. Thanks for showing me them though, never heard of it before.  
p71
aVWhat did it for me was finding an ecig with the right kind of throat hit.  The first couple ecigs were comparable to hookahs.  Those just made me want to smoke cigarettes.  The last one, which helped me quit, had the right throat hit to help me replace cigarettes.  Juul is the brand.  There are some other brands in the same category.  Im sure the vape subredit has more info on them.    
p72
aVAnyone have experience quitting the juul?\u000a\u000aI use a juul its a vape that I have been using for a couple months I'm really trying to stop or at least cut back significantly anyone have experience quitting this device in particular. 
p73
aVTo clarify a bit: Do you hate the e-cig because it's messing with your erections, because of the flavor, or because you've got it locked in a box and can only occasionally access it?\u000a\u000aAs for the erections, I have only anecdotal evidence from personal experience: My erections are so hard to the point of almost painful when I am using an e-cig instead of smoking, whereas when I am smoking I have difficulty keeping it up.\u000a\u000aAs for flavor: I work in a vape/tobacco shop and the people who have the best success switching from smoking to vaping are those that find flavors they love. Making the e-cig MORE desirable than having a cigarette is definitely a key part to quitting smoking with one. Try other flavors from Juul, or hit up a vape shop, find juice you like, pop open an empty pod with a bobby pin, and fill it yourself. Experimenting with the flavors and finding YOUR flavor of choice is what will help make the quit successful.\u000a\u000aAs for the locked box: what length is the timer? Can you bypass the timer to access it if you get a particularly intense craving?\u000a\u000aIf the issue is mainly with the flavor and you haven't found a Juul juice that you enjoy, you may have better luck using a different device that has a larger variety. The "My Von Erl" would be my next recommendation, followed by the Cync, then the MyJet.
p74
aVI stayed on the same nicotine cause I was using the juul ecig which only has the one level. It wasn't really planned to stop on day 30 but it started by thinking how long can I go and quickly realized I wasn't craving it. There's no need to rush and vaping is already a huge improvement just remember that it's a tool to use while quitting not a permanent alternative.
p75
aVI switched to vaping to quick analog cigs just over four months ago, and experienced something similar (though I too have a preexisting anxiety condition, which had something to do with it).\u000a\u000aFor me, it took a while to find the right unit and the right juice (at the right strength). I started with the Juul cigalike, which I enjoyed but finding the pods was just too much hassle. I switched to the My Von Erl, and love it. I use the Frisco Vapor juice pods (way better range of flavors) at either 18mg or 24mg, and typically only need around three or four hits to feel satisfied. If I took 10-15 hits as I would on an analog cigarette, I'd probably have a bad time.\u000a\u000aDon't give up. I've found vaping to be indispensable as a quitting tool, especially while I was still drinking (one of my worst smoking triggers). I'd recommend experimenting with different strengths of juice as well as how many hits you need to feel good. You'll soon adapt to how the nicotine juice affects you.\u000a\u000aAnd yes, definitely pay close attention to your dietary changes. Smoking is an appetite suppressant, so be sure to listen to what your body is telling you. Personally, I've had to be much more focused on eating enough and staying hydrated since I quit analogs. \u000a\u000aGood luck!
p76
aVQuitting is so damn hard... I feel like I'm making things worse.\u000a\u000aI could use some encouragement guys. I've been trying to quit for over 2 years now. Started smoking regularly 3 years ago when I was working with a bunch of guys who smoked and I was going through a stressful time (not a good excuse but that's how I justified it). I was smoking about 2-3 packs a week which wasn't so bad and then a friend suggested I try switching to Juul 2 years ago to try quitting. That was the worst thing I could have done... I was burning though way more nicotine that ever before and needed to get buzzed off that thing every waking minute of the day. For the last year I've been using nicotine gum, mints, patches etc., smashed my juul with a hammer in the spring, but I keep relapsing. I've spent so much money on the patches, etc and I'm at a total loss of what to do. Its just such an embarrassing thing for me that I'm ashamed to ask for help but here I am. If you guys have any advice for what I should do I'd be very grateful. Thanks everybody. 
p77
aVGet a suorin - they give a very similar sensation to juuls, only you have more control over the juice (plus, they're cheaper). There are probably other e-cig devices that are similar, but this is what I'm familiar with. \u000a\u000aThen, buy one 35mg juice and one 0mg juice. Start with the 35mg juice - it's already less than juuls (which are about 50mg), then every time you refill, start titrating the 35mg juice with the 0mg juice. You'll get less and less nicotine every time until you are (hopefully!) down to 0mg.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;
p78
aVThank you for this, very informative and it matches a lot of the studies that I\u2019ve read. \u000a\u000aIs there any vape you would recommend?  I\u2019m really interested in convineice, I don\u2019t want to get a bulky mod and mess around with juice.  I was thinking something like a Juul but with a lower nicotine content.  Here in the UK I think it\u2019s 1.8% but I will be headin back to the states soon and I think the lowest available is 3%.\u000a\u000aI also wants something that is able to mimic the taste and hit of a cigarette, although I can accept there probably isn\u2019t a vape that\u2019s going to give me the exact same feeling.  \u000a\u000aSuggestions?
p79
aVWhat kind of an e cigarette would you recommend?  I\u2019m thinking of getting a Juul
p80
aVAny recommendations?  I have thought about a Juul because they are so popular, but going with the lower nicotine content.  Or is that still too much nicotine?  Is 3mg the same as 3%? 
p81
aVno, 3mg content refers to the amount of nicotine per millileter. If you buy a juul, the content will be much higher than 3mg. if you buy something like this (https://www.misthub.com/products/smok-stick-prince-starter-kit) which is what I have personally, the tank will hold 8mg of juice at a time. If you smoke an entire tank's worth of 3mg juice in this specific vape, you will be consuming 24mg of nicotine, or about w cigarettes worth of nicotine. It takes me 2-3 days to vape that much. Plus all the additives of cigarettes are not there. 
p82
aVJuul screwed me up man. I was doing pretty good and switched to one and now its been a 2 year battle for me... Ecigs are so damn nice, that's the problem imho.
p83
aVThat was me after Juul... Sucked, I had no idea I'd get so hooked when I was able control my cig use.
p84
aVJuuls are little devils! I\u2019m so much more hooked now because you can bring it anywhere and hit it so discreetly. I\u2019ve started refilling the pods w lower nic juice to taper down but it\u2019s hard 
p85
aVI think I'm going to buy a juul.\u000a\u000aI know it's not necessarily a step totally in the right direction, but I can't seem to last cold turkey and I would like, at least, to avoid the smell and the ugly coughing. I'm worried though because it's a lot of money for me. Any advice?
p86
aVThere are a lot to vaping than just juul. However, a lot of people start with juul just to stop smoking. Once they have quit smoking they dig into how they can vape for a cheaper cost. Perhaps you can try that too? 
p87
aVMy personal progress and what I\u2019m doing to save money, and quit for good.\u000a\u000aHi all! So I\u2019m officially 2 days without a cig. I am however using a juul. I couldn\u2019t have quit without it. There was just no way for me.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m already breathing better, and I can feel that I have more energy.\u000a\u000aI spend roughly $20 a day on cigs, and a pack of 4 juul pods at $25 will last me about a week.\u000a\u000aSo I\u2019m using the Acorns app on my phone to take out $20 a day from my account and deposit it into its \u201csavings\u201d\u000a\u000aNot sure what I\u2019m going to spend the extra $7,000 on in a year but I\u2019m excited for it!\u000a\u000aI do plan on weening myself slowly from the juul.\u000a\u000aYesterday I was super moody. Today is definitely better and I do crave a cig here and there but I just hit the juul a couple times and it goes away.\u000a\u000aJust thought I\u2019d share, this method may not be for everyone but so far it\u2019s working for me. Good luck everyone!
p88
aVWell first I switched to a juul but I didn\u2019t like that i was still dependent on something and the cost became ludicrous and unjustifiable. My girlfriend who didn\u2019t know I smoked at the time found my stuff and I decided to just say fuck it and quit cold turkey. \u000a\u000aIt was six weeks of absolute hell and a good two months of brutal cravings until I finally leveled out. \u000aIt was brutal but I look back and it\u2019s well worth it. I think cold turkey is the best way because as long as I\u2019m putting nicotine into my system my inner addict will always try to justify using more and more. \u000a\u000aIt\u2019s fucking rough and I never expected it to be harder to kick than oxy. Anyone still fighting this demon has my everlasting respect. 
p89
aVIt was a disgusting amount a day. I started when I was 13 and quit at age 19, turned 20 this summer. I decided I didn\u2019t want to go into my 20\u2019s as a smoker. \u000a\u000aAs for the disgusting amount I used, I went through two juul pods a day, a can of dip, an a cigar or two for good measure and on a really bad day you could double that. It was absolutely disgusting. It was six weeks of hell and about two months of brutal cravings before I leveled out. 
p90
aVI quit cold turkey multiple times, it never worked. Months would go by, and I still craved a cigarette all the time like I had just quit. \u000a\u000a\u000aI use a better vape than the Juul. Coils cost 2 bucks and last 3 weeks to a month, it has an internal tank I refill. Get my juice free from a friend, well, I invested a bit so it wasn't free, but it works.\u000a\u000a\u000aIt's far cheaper than people think. The Juul and mainstream vapes aren't the only option.\u000a\u000a\u000aIt's not a lack of mental strength, either. I just walked a quarter mile to the cabin in the woods on the property here. I was wearing panties, a light jacket, unzipped, and a headlamp, no hat or gloves. It's 4F outside, with 6 inches of snow. I've hiked almost 50 miles in one day.\u000a\u000a\u000aI'm happy with vaping, even if I never quit it, I'll never smoke another cigarette again. It transferred psychologically the need for a cigarette to the need for a vape, I have no desire for a cigarette at all, and haven't for years.\u000a\u000a\u000aI don't use more and more, in fact, I'm cutting down, and plan on quitting, because I won't be able to constantly charge it on longer hikes. 
p91
aVYou can do it!\u000aAnd if you cant (like me), get a juul. \u000aFuckin works and i feel great.
p92
aVYo same here. My last puff on the vape was Saturday and I\u2019m having a feeling like I\u2019m microdosing aderall. \u000a\u000aJuul?
p93
aVwoah bro, i was literally just about to describe that. it feels like adderall except with no euphoria. such a weird feeling. i used to smoke two juul pods a day, but i switched to a suorin vagon, and ran through an entire refillable pod until the cotton burned, and i couldnt use it anymore
p94
aVI had my last cigarette on 10/26 and switched to a Juul. Only problem (if you want to call it that) is now they aren\u2019t distributing flavors due to the federal ban in the US. \u000a\u000aRegarding the cough; I still am clearing my throat all day and I quit the Juul on 12/22. 
p95
aVLiterally anything but nicotine. Making lists, smoke free app, cruising through this sub. I\u2019ve had a couple close calls for going back to the Juul but not for cigs. 
p96
aVHey, that\u2019s what my friend just got me this morning to help me quit. I tried cold turkey but my anxiety disorder made me crack hard on day 3, so I\u2019m glad to see it can help stop the habit. Fingers crossed. I already hate my cigarettes after stopping for a few days. \u000a\u000aDid your breathing improve at all as compared to cigarettes while using Juul or was it about the same?  
p97
aVGet an iCare 140, it's small, and pretty good. Juul, etc, are shitty compared to what you can get in a vape store. 
p98
aVHow do you mean that Juul, etc is shitty? Less strong? Less reliable?
p99
aVLess reliable, costs more than it should, replacement pods are too expensive, short battery life. I use an iCare 140, charge maybe once a day, 2ml tank, coils last like 3 weeks, cost 10 bucks for a pack of 5. It's really similar in use to Juul, a really small vape, but I use juice my friend makes, and it tastes a lot better. 1.5 ounces, so still pretty light, if I want to take it with me when I go hiking. 
p100
aVNeed Advice - Going with Family to Mexico, Quit Now or Later?\u000a\u000aHi all! \u000a\u000aI'm addicted to vaping (I use a suorin, which is similar to a juul), and I'm really embarrassed about it. I started smoking cigarettes after a bad break up, and after beginning to mooch my friends' juuls a lot, I ended up buying it myself. I really regret it and want to quit soon, I guess I just haven't found the right "time". For reference, I'm a 20 YO college student. \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aI'm going down to Mexico with my family tomorrow. We're driving across the border. I'm really worried that my suorin is going to get confiscated at the border, or at least get pulled out and checked. My parents don't know I smoke and would (rightfully) freak out if they did. \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aSo I'm presented with a few options:\u000a\u000a1. Bring it anyway, hide it in my bag and hope nobody searches our stuff. Hopefully quit soon. \u000a2. Don't bring it, and use this as an excuse to start quitting. The reason I'm hesitant to do this is that I know I will be really moody during the first period of nicotine withdrawals, and I don't want to ruin our family vacation. \u000a3. Purchase nicotine gum/nicotine patches to prevent withdrawals but jumpstart me quitting. To me, this seems like the best option, but I'm only 20 and can't legally buy them in my state. I have a fake ID that I've been using to buy cigs / vape stuff, but I feel like most of the places that I buy from are pretty lenient on IDs and I'm worried my fake wouldn't work at a normal drug store.\u000a4. ???\u000a\u000aThank you for reading. I would love to hear your advice and support. I feel like an idiot right now for letting myself get into this situation. \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;
p101
aVThank you for your reply! \u000a\u000aI've already started reducing my nic-level (part of the reason I chose a suorin over a juul, since there's more freedom in choosing your juice. I started at 50mg, currently at 35mg), and am planning on continuing to do so.\u000a\u000a I've started to get a little lazy about it, but my anxiety over this situation reminded me of how important it is that I continue. 
p102
aVGood for you! The wife and I are coming up on a year (March). We still use Juul, not sure if you consider that cheating. Anyway, great job!
p103
aVNicotine Alternative for Juuling (Funny)\u000a\u000a
p104
aVThe Juul does. With tanks, you can decide the nicotine strength. Still addictive, but better than cigs. 
p105
aVThank you for the very tasteful and encouraging posts; I\u2019m two months off ciggies but only a week off the Juul. 
p106
aVInsomnia.\u000a\u000aI'm on day 2 of no smoking nicotine, I was using vuse ecigs and juuls pretty much a couple times a week for a few months but I've decided to stop for good. Yesterday I took a klonopin and fell asleep easily but tonight I took melatonin and only got about an hour. I'm tired but I feel like I can't fall asleep. My body just gets antsy in one position. Will this eventually go away?

aVQuitting Juuls\u000a\u000aThis may be an unconventional post in here since a lot of people are quitting cigarettes, but I\u2019m looking for some advice on quitting my juul. I\u2019m a college student, so I\u2019m broke enough, but buying a pack a week is really destroying my wallet. I\u2019ve been juuling and smoking an occasional cigarette for about a year. \u000a\u000aI\u2019ve tried quitting twice, but I ended up buying more packs because I had some serious withdrawals. It made me feel like I don\u2019t have the will or strength to cold turkey. Should I buy a different vape and ease down nicotine levels, or does anyone have some advice for cold turkey? \u000a\u000aThanks in advance!
p108
aVThe only way I was able to finally quit my Juul was by giving it away (selling it to a friend). Also got addicted to it in college for about a year. Tbh, I just replaced the urge to smoke the juul with smoking a wax pen (weed) until I was completely over the Juul buzz. This probably wasn\u2019t the most logical method of quitting smoking, but at least it felt better for my insides and wasn\u2019t giving me headaches. But it also took me feeling physically horrible to realize that I needed to stop Juuling completely. But now it\u2019s been at least 3 months without one and I don\u2019t even ask to hit my friends\u2019. You got this, maybe ask a friend to just hold onto it for a while so the temptation isn\u2019t right in front of you!

aVI think that Juuls and Suorin Drops are the best things that emulate that harsh hit that Dark Blue american spirits and Malboro Reds have. You might also want to try either a higher mg one or a strong flavored juice.\u000a\u000aAlso Juuls and Suorins are a little more similar to the way you would hit a cigarette, because regular vapes have a different kind of "Inhale" if you get what I'm saying.
p110
aVI made very bad experience with vaping nicotine, because i started to vape much more often than smoking. I also inhaled that much that i would say i absorbed 10x more nicotine than with cigarettes. Be aware that vaping is even more addictive than smoking. I.e. you can vape all day, 10 hours in a row is no problem. But normally you can not smoke 10 hours in a row.\u000a\u000aIf you want to stop smoking using an ecigarette you need a tight exit plan (eg. reducing 1mg nicotine every 4th day, reducing the puffs from x to y every z day, and always observe yourself how deeply you inhale, as it is a major factor of the real nicotine intake to your blood). Therefore a juul,with this incredible amount of nicotine is (imo) nothing to use to stop smoking. As mentioned here before, you just get your harmful drug from another dealer who earns billions with your addiction.

aVFrom smoking to vaping\u000a\u000aI have a plan in place for the New Year.  I quit drinking a week ago, and switched from smoking to vaping, which I plan to do until the New Year, and then will quit that as well.  It's harder than I thought it would be.  I was always of the mindset that nicotine is nicotine, and vaping- in addition to other NR methods- would be an equal exchange, but it's not.  I always thought it would just be better to go cold turkey (which I've done unsuccessfully many, *many* times).  I'm vaping a Juul, which has a high nicotine content, so it seems I shouldn't want to smoke at all, but I do.  I have to fight constantly not to go and buy a pack of smokes.  \u000a\u000aSmoking cigs hurts my lungs really bad, and always has.  My lungs get tight and close up, and I've caught myself stop breathing in my sleep.  Vaping is a little better, but not a lot- it still hurts my lungs, but not as dramatically as regular smoke.  It's definitely not something I want to do long-term.\u000a\u000aBut my point of this post is I take back my negative view of vaping and NR.  I see that there is a lot more habit breaking needed in my brain than simply cutting off nicotine.  I feel like vaping is allowing my body to detox all the garbage that comes from regular cigarettes, and that when it comes time to stop vaping, it won't be as dramatic.  That's my hope, anyway.  I'd love to hear from anyone who has used vaping to successfully quit smoking.  Thanks for listening.

aVWhat is the best patch to start with to quit?\u000a\u000aHeavy juul user. Smoked a pod a day foras long as I can remember. In retrospect, I really wish I never started with the Juul. 
p113
aV2 Days - Trying Hard\u000a\u000aHi All,\u000a\u000aIt's my second day and I'm really hoping to actually stick to it this time, got the app and everything. I've been addicted since my freshman year of college to nicotine from both cigarettes and the juul. I've smoked weed since high school. I've had both of these addictions until now my junior year of college. I'm at home right now for winter break and am trying to kick both habits. I'm gonna skateboard and lift weights until I go back to school, hopefully by that point all of the cravings and headaches have passed. Anyways, wanted to post to make this a little more real. Been lurking for a while, you are all an inspiration.
p114
aVJuul's not powerful enough IMO. If you are anywhere close to a pack a day smoker, I'd recommend a much more powerful vape. I needed to chuck serious clouds to realize that I only actually enjoy the act of smoking and nothing else. The Juul is just too weak for a full departure from smoking/inhaling/vaping anything. Just my opinion. I was an 18 year smoker and quit in 1 day, never looked back with a mod by a company called "Vaporesso". \u000a\u000aI used to like Smok products, but when they leak...OMG...so I switched and then I was free. Whole process took me 6 months. There was no way I could go cold turkey. So salute to you!
p115
aVDid quitting improve the health of your hair?\u000a\u000aPlanning on quitting soon. Been using a juul (not the same Ik, still a nicotine fiend) for about a year. I\u2019ve been suffering from hair loss, especially thinning hair. I\u2019m currently on finasteride to help, but I did some digging and found that nicotine can accelerate hair loss. Has anyone that quit noticed an improvement in the health of their hair? 
p116
aVYeah Caus the nature of nicotine is to need and want it 24/7 .its our health concerns that control us into not chain smoking .but vaping we don't think about that so a lot of us will suck on it all day non stop .and thats a lot of nicotine and a lot of garbage chemicals every minute or so .\u000aThe salt ones like the juul are even worse because drugs are more addictive when they go to the brain faster .the faster the worse .\u000aIf you just go out once or twice a week and have a couple cigs youd be better with that then vaping all day .get a disposable if anything for the night out and toss it after .\u000aDon't get a juul no matter what .that thing is evil .
p117
aVHonestly,  I know there is a ton of debate on this sub about vaping but have you tried juul? \u000a\u000aYes,  you're still getting nicotine and I know that is that ultimate goal,  but you can eliminate the smell,  shortness of breath and dramatically decrease the health risks associated with smoking,  by switching. Not to mention you get to quit without going through crazy withdrawal symptoms and it ends up being cheaper than smoking. \u000a\u000aIt's honestly the best NRT option out there.  So get off of cigarettes. Start with that.  Then reduce your nicotine level. \u000a\u000aI was a pack/ day smoker and for a few months now ive replaced all of my daytime cigs with juul. After the new year,  I plan on eliminating my night smokes as well and going cigarette free. 
p118
aVI will piggy back off of this and say that JUUL helped me kick the habit during the summer. Tried to give up JUUL in the early fall, smoked a pack of cigarettes in two weeks, went back on JUUL for a couple of months while I read up on quitting more and now I\u2019m weening myself off JUUL. My cravings for cigarettes virtually disappeared when I got a JUUL. I bought the starter pack online through their website and I think it gave me a discount. Then they emailed me asking to do a monthly survey for $30/mo. After half a year you can see how it paid for itself. Anyway, if that\u2019s still an option then I would jump on board. At least you\u2019d be saving money and eliminating the tar and carbon monoxide from cigarettes. Then down the road you can lower your nicotine dosage. Good luck. It\u2019s a challenging road, but not impossible. 
p119
aViCare 140 is better than Juul, and cheaper. It's what I use. 
p120
aVSame I\u2019m juuling now and it simply does not urge my bowels 
p121
aVStopped smoking 6 months ago- switched to Juul and vape. I want to quit those, too.\u000a\u000aStopping smoking was difficult, but I used vaping as a crutch. I now resort to vaping just as frequently as I did cigarettes. I\u2019m ready to quit completely- I will start this afternoon! 
p122
aVDoing it all over again...\u000a\u000aI quit smoking in June of 2017 cold turkey and was good until about August of this year. I went to a military training which lead me to missing my time in the smoke pit just talking to everyone about anything and everything. I picked up a juul just for almost nostalgic purposes, but also not wanting to smoke cigarettes. Thinking it would be fine and would be a quick and easy thing to kick again. \u000a\u000aHowever, it did exactly the opposite and brought my nicotine addiction back in full effect and probably even worse. I tried to keep it on the DL because I was pretty ashamed of myself for being so naive and silly. I decided to get rid of it after a few months and have been smoking 1/4 to 1/2 a pack a day in secret. Constantly washing my hands and face and brushing my teeth to get rid of any hint of the smell. Today starts the day that I cut the shit and get myself back to where I was because I felt so damn good, and now I feel like crap again. \u000a\u000aSeeing all your posts and kind words to others helps. Cheers.
p123
aVEvery time you quit you have all the info and experiences you learned on previous attempts to help you through. Now you know you can\u2019t pick up a juul casually. This is great as you\u2019re so less likely to do it again!\u000a\u000aGood luck. 
p124
aVLet's do this. Joel Spitzer and Allen Carr please get my back. Lots of juice and gum. No vape, no Juuls, no dip, no snus. Cigarettes would make me ill at this point. One hour, one day at a time.\u000a\u000a

aVThanks guys at twenty hours now! The hardest was waking up and not smoking I could have got up and grabbed one of my boyfriends cigs but decided to stay in bed for half hour and hit the juul. Honestly I\u2019m loving the fact that I can be lazy and don\u2019t HAVE to wake up for a cigarette. Staying in bed and cuddling and watching \u201cmonster trucks\u201d as my two year old requested beats stinky ass cigs anyway! 
p129
aVI absolutely understand this. Smoking was always something that was apart of celebrations and good times for me. The issue (I think) is that it never stopped at just the good times. It crept its way into every aspect of my life until it was all the time. But I do find it hard to feel like I\u2019m celebrating without smoking. I trained myself to equate the two. I can\u2019t say that I have any advice(coming up on 2 months, although I Juul constantly just to stay away.)  \u000a\u000aMy guess is that it\u2019s a matter of retraining ourselves. We\u2019re Pablo\u2019s dogs and when the \u201chappy bell\u201d rings we need to give a different treat until smoking is no longer the expectation/craving. The hardest part seems to be the actual time it will take. I developed my smoking rituals over a decade period, why should I expect new ideas and ways of life to take less time than that? \u000a
p130
aVThey\u2019re coming here next weekend. Thinking about doing it. Just want to say thanks for your drawings. I have 29 days today quitting Juul/vapes and your drawings have been a daily inspiration. I converted to that from a pack a day 7ish years ago. Nicotine sucks either way, I traded a nasty nicotine addiction for a cleaner nicotine addiction that isn\u2019t much cheaper? It\u2019s so goddamn stupid.  Keep it up!
p131
aVThey are just if not more addictive than cigarettes. If you\u2019re not already hooked on smoking don\u2019t start with vaping.\u000a\u000aIf you end up ignoring this advice grab yourself the 0 nicotine e-juice and stay away from cartridge based devices like JUUL where you don\u2019t control the nicotine strength. This way you can vape w/ your friends if you must without the cost of addiction. Ideally just don\u2019t do it though.\u000a\u000aI feel like E-cigs are useful for harm reduction where you don\u2019t plan on quitting nicotine. You MAY be reducing the respiratory risks but the cardio and psychological risks are still there.\u000a\u000a
p132
aVAdvice?\u000a\u000amy dad has been smoking for my entire life, he started when he was 16. and he\u2019s 55 now. i bought him a juul and he said it hurt his throat and he coughed even with small lung hits, any advice to ween him down to fewer cigarettes, or help him stop entirely?
p133
aVThank you so much for the response!\u000a\u000aMe: 40 Male. 5'9" 155lbs. Lived a decently healthy lifestyle aside from years of smoking and years of smoking weed. However I stopped combusting pot in 2012. Smoked menthol cigs since 1997 and as I said before I quit in mid October so it's been about 7 weeks or so.\u000a\u000aCaught a cold, went and saw my doc. Xray showed slight Pneumonia in my left lung. Gave me antibiotics and a B12 shot. Sent me on my way. Felt better after a week and WHAM! Got sick again. Went back to doc, Xray was clear this time. Gave me stronger antibiotics, some prednisone, and a shot of cortizone. Week later, I was still pretty sick. Went to ER on a Sunday. Blah blah blah, nothing new from there, lungs clear, seemed to have a cold, ect. \u000a\u000aBoth doctors, mine and ER said that because I am not smoking that my lungs are healing. Okaaaay? So am I supposed to feel like I have a cold or symptoms of extreme allergies? Meaning my sinuses are either clogged or draining and my voice sounds like I'm dying. The cough isn't like that uncontrollable cough when you're full fledged sick, it's more of a whooping, hacking up shit cough. \u000a\u000aI dropped all the meds on Sunday. After like 3 weeks of various cold meds, I needed a break. Now I am just chomping my daily probiotics and multi V and trying to drink a lot of water. I'm feeling better but the above symptoms (sinus/chest congestion) are still bad. \u000a\u000aI quit smoking by using the JUUL. I did as much reading as could find on it and both doctors agree that the JUUL shouldn't be related whatsoever to the cold/congestion and even said while they don't wanna say it's this great thing, it's better to use that then to smoke. tl/dr: If the JUUL keeps me from lighting up, then amen!\u000a\u000aNow for you Doc! Ya gotta try this thing, OMG. 25 years of smoking. Tried everything to quit, you name it I tried it, zero success. Bought a JUUL and gave it a week. Took a bit of getting used to, similar to changing brands. After a week, I lit up a cigarette and almost died. It was so awful. The JUUL fills all the voids and gives you hits of nicotine. Yeah yeah, you know this i'm sure. Holy shit does it work though and you can use the thing pretty much anywhere with zero worries. 3 quick little puffs and it's like you had a full smoke. Satisfied. The whole ritual of smoking is involved too. A device about the size of a cigarette, you hit it and blow out a small amount of vapor, the hit feels like you just hit a cigarette but better but it takes away all the bad shit. No burning, no smell, no tar. It's less expensive and they have a flavor called mango that's like crack. It's amazing and best of all I QUIT SMOKING!!! Never going back. I dunno. Works for me.
p134
aVHi, thanks for your detailed response as well. To be honest I've quit before for a few months at a time but am looking to get rid of it for good. I'm getting a little older now (33 soon) and ones ability to recover on the longer scale diminishes with time [like this graph shows](http://stopsmokingstayquit.blogspot.com/2014/07/i-just-turned-50-had-physical-and-my.html) so I'm looking to take giving up more seriously. I always found NRT very helpful, and I think you hit the nail on the head with the *ritual of smoking*; I've had moderate success with gum in the past, but may just check out that JUUL.  \u000a\u000a&gt;  [They said] because I am not smoking that my lungs are healing. Okaaaay? So am I supposed to feel like I have a cold or symptoms of extreme allergies?  \u000a\u000aAs per the earlier reply, unfortunately yes. As the hairs I mentioned in your lungs recover, they will make you feel like shit because they are finally doing what they are meant to (i.e. removing 20 years of tar from your lungs).  \u000a\u000aHaving had a pneumonia will complicate this obviously, but it's worth remembering that after **any** chest infection a persistent cough may remain for some weeks, even with resolution of findings on the chest X-ray.  \u000a\u000aUnfortunately it may be a long road with these on-off symptoms, complicated by recent infection, but know that by the time next winter rolls around, you will likely feel better than you have in years, and will be unlikely to need to contend with antibiotics, steroids, or breathlessness ever again. Keep up the good fight!
p135
aVI gotta say thank you again. As long as I can get a grasp on what\u2019s in front of me I can deal with it. As long as I mentally feel like this is making me better in the long run I can handle it. \u000a\u000aI always said 30 was the magic year to quit. That didn\u2019t happen. Then 35. Same story. In my case I had a lot of trauma happen in that decade so 40 was paramount. No more excuses.\u000a\u000aThe JUUL is very controversial. I get it. It\u2019s uncharted waters. However some facts are simple. There\u2019s no carcinogens.  There\u2019s some metallic matter but it would take some serious doing to make it dangerous in the short term. Long term is unknown but it buys me some significant time especially where I am at in my lifespan. I wanna make it to 90. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unreasonable for our generation. Do you? Please try the JUUL. If anything it gets you away from the cigs. Worth it right? Once you try it. I\u2019ll caution you. It\u2019s seriously addictive. Straight shot of nicotine in one of the most arguably purest forms. However, is that any different from a patch or some gum? I don\u2019t know. All I know is that I don\u2019t smoke anymore and if my body is losing its shit trying to heal then I know my plan is working. \u000a\u000aThank you so much doc. Seriously, this is what I needed to hear. Your internet advice is enough to make me sleep better and not worry so much. Annual physicals will be a part of my life forever so I\u2019ll keep an eye on things from here. \u000a\u000aAgain, thank you. \U0001f918\U0001f3fb
p136
aVThe vape didn\u2019t work for me at all. I had a juul briefly and lost it but the few weeks I did have it I didn\u2019t quit cigarettes but to me a juul seemed to been most like a cig than vape so maybe I should get one again.
p137
aV&gt; juul seemed to been most like a cig \u000a\u000aIt's because Juul's use Nicotine Salts (or nic-salts) that gives the drag weight but remains mellow.  Most other vapes do not use nicsalts.- However beware Juul if you intend to quit! Juul has a very high % of nicotine, higher mg's than a Marlborough Red! Before I quit for good, I switched to Juul and then switched back to cigs.  I smoked more cigs after the Juul than before.\u000a\u000aThe best way to quit is to quit the nicotine.  That said- if it's just for neighbors, than a vape will be the way to go.\u000a
p138
aVHaving trouble quitting nicotine devices\u000a\u000aI quit smoking cigarettes by switching over the suorin, juul, etc.. Now this has become an issue. The max I can go without it is a day and I start fiending. Thing is i'm around my friends a lot and they also have it on them at all times. I gave mine for my friend to hold as well but it is still now helping. Any tips would be great
p139
aVDoes using a Juul count as quitting?\u000a\u000a
p140
aVI think the answer to that depends on the individual and their doctor. I vape instead and there's a noticeable difference for the better in my breathing, skin, teeth and even my pocketbook (but I use a different vaping system than Juul for the financial aspect). The eventual goal is no nicotine for me but the larger priority for now is not smoking so to me--and my doctor--it does count!
p141
aVJuul count as "quitting" =  for cigarettes, yes.  For nicotine addiction, no.  \u000a\u000aThere is a distinction between the addiction itself and the delivery system.   Health damage differs between each Nicotine delivery system, which ranges from Vapes, Gums, Patch, chew, cigarettes, etc. \u000a\u000aQuitting the addiction covers all the above and is the only that addresses the mental / chemical dependence to Nicotine as well. \u000a
p142
aVI\u2019m in the same boat i smoked religiously for almost 8 years now and I bought the Juul one day and haven\u2019t touched a cigarette in 24 days now I just hope it\u2019s a safer alternative than actual smoking 
p143
aVHuh, smoking after eating always makes me almost throw up.\u000a\u000aMy tips might not be great since we have different "triggers", but for me it's when I get stressed or anxious. I usually replace the cig with strong black coffee (I'm also currently Juuling).\u000a\u000aThe chai tea is great. If anything, know that by not smoking, the flavor of the tea will be a lot more enjoyable.\u000a\u000aMaybe something to fiddle with in your hands?
p144
aVHow to stop Juuling\u000a\u000aHello, I am 18 years old and have been juuling for about 3 months. i am wanting to stop, but am curious what withdrawal symptoms i would see, if any, and how to cope with those. much appreciated 
p145
aVWhat the hell is \u201cJuuling\u201d
p146
aVIs smoking a Juul a good alternative/good way to start quitting?\u000a\u000aI'm curious because a LOT of my friends are smoking these things and I'm debating whether or not it's worth it. I definitely want to quit smoking cigarettes but I'm not sure I'll be able to handle the nicotine withdrawal and will just jump right back into my bad habit.\u000a\u000aThanks for your help!
p147
aVChantix is helping me.... I dont know what a juul is,  all I know is for me,  smoking anything isnt an option been there done that... I needed a nicotine free approach to quitting.... I found that prolonging my withdrawl with NRT was making it worse for longer and i always would relapse. 
p148
aVIt's working for me. I used the lozenges for the first month, then picked up a SMOK for when I was out, now I have a Juul. I'm five months in and still going strong. Only advice I'd offer is keeping the Juul far away from you while you're at home/work/anywhere you wouldn't normally be smoking. It's SUPER easy to slide into a new habit with something so convenient.
p149
aVDont smoke those juuls/nicotine alot vapes. They're terrible. Literally a little crack stick you can use anywhere.\u000a Almost worse than smoking..my personal advice
p150
aVThe Juul devices are kind of crap--i'd advise a SMOK device or something similar--essentially, anything you can get at a gas station is almost designed to suck and get you back on the cigs.\u000aVaping is leaps and bounds better than the cigs--the trick is finding a setup that works for you.   \u000aThat said, if you can just quit cold turkey, no vaping, no smoking.....well, good for you, and do that.    Go to a vape shop, and get something that allows for a variable nicotine content--a six or a twelve mg juice at first, and adjust higher or lower based on your level of satisfaction with it. \u000aFrom there, you can titrate it down to lower nicotine levels if you wish.   Down to zero, even.

aVFinally trying to commit to quitting after lies and a couple of failed battles...\u000a\u000aI have been vaping for almost two years now and I originally got into it because my ex did it and I thought it was cool.\u000a\u000aI have been hiding my vaping from my fiance for a few months now and it is difficult stressful and it plain sucks. Juul has been my fix of choice as of late and I find myself craving it so much when I don't have it for more than an hour. I managed to quit about 6 months ago for about two months, but during a particularly stressful time I really really wanted the buzz, the high if you will. I gave in and ever since I have been hiding it from my fiance. I sneak into the bathroom, hide battery packs and chargers to make sure I can have it charged when I want a hit. \u000a\u000aI am hoping that through some support from this subreddit that I might be able to finally kick it for good. Thanks for reading this. \u000a\u000aToday is day one I just threw out the device and all related parts...
p154
aVJuuled for the past 4 years every day\u000a\u000aI'm finally realizing that my nicotine addiction is getting overwhelming. I'm a sophomore in college and it affects me physically and mentally on a daily bases. I'm currently at about a pod a day and  I often find myself out of breath simply from walking up and down the stairs to my room. I've tried quitting for the past few months but I always end up buying another pack of pods. Can anyone share helpful tips or tricks they used get the process of quitting started more smoothly? Also how do you get the counter for days since you quit? Thanks
p155
aVThe problem with juuls which I think you have seen especially in American, is that they are soooo strong. The addiction is terrible with them. I think maybe going to a vape and getting a lower dose of nicotine then going no nicotine and then finally into nothing.
p156
aVGet something that allows you to titrate the nicotine content of the juice you're using.   Slowly switch to a juice that's lower in nicotine...they do make zero nic juices--Juuls and Blues are seemingly designed to suck.\u000a
p157
aVDamn, fucking cigarettes eh... I'm struggling with going a week; crazy that after a year the mind still craves them. I guess they're an easy crutch that the mind remembers.\u000a\u000aYou've done it once, time to do it again homie. This time for good! Have you ever vaped? I'm just asking because if you ever do come back on this path - maybe grab a juul or high nic salt pod device. I find them a lot easier to quit than after a week of cigarettes. Cheers! Best of luck. \U0001f340\U0001f37b

aVDay 5 and holy shit this is hard.\u000a\u000aHey guys.\u000a\u000aI'm posting to reach out in an attempt to really make this quit the one that sticks. I want to hear your best and kindest advice about how to deal with the trials and tribulations that will inevitably arise. This is my 5th quit attempt and I so desperately want this to be the one. I've been a pack a day smoker for 12 years and I'm currently on the patch. I even bought a juul cigarette to use in cases of dire emergencies. I'm just looking for a healthy and safe place to talk about the bullshit that accompanies quitting and a judgment free zone to talk about it. I feel like I'm giving up my best friend and my identity. I've spent so long feeling like being a smoker defined who I am, and I'm not sure I know or even like the person outside of that. I want to hear about your routes of self discovery. The things you learned, albeit good or bad, and how you're coping with it now. And also, how I can help.
p159
aVAfter two months in the hospital and being forced to quit , when I tried it again, I didn\u2019t like it.  But I still like nicotine duh. So I\u2019ve just been using a Juul like the millennial I am.  But yeah I\u2019m the car is definitely the hardest.   
p160
aVNo problem at all. I have just become a nonsmoker. It is the single best thing I've ever done for myself! It will be the best thing you do, too.\u000a\u000aI understand the impulse to shy away from MORE cigarettes. I felt so weird by that point in the book, taking one more puff. I used a Juul, so not a cigarette. It was my addiction at the time. I think it will have less impact for you. It's about feeling the sensations and making concrete, the feeling that this is not what you want. \u000a\u000aPlease, please, please read the book. And do it today. \u000a\u000aCongratulations on 48 hours! You are seriously ONLY 3 days from being free of ANY physical symptoms. Let me know if there is any way I can help you, any information I can pass along -- how to deal with certain aspects, why stuff happens. I'm not an expert, I'm just a guy who managed to quit smoking. You need to do this, and you need to do it for good. \u000a\u000a

aVI\u2019m in the same boat right now! I\u2019ve had a history of asthma/sinusitis and have had that combo for about 2 weeks. Switched from dipping to a Juul over the summer and the Juul was killing my congestion and lungs. Decided I\u2019d just stop since I didn\u2019t like it anymore anyway, 4 days down!
p162
aVI use a Juul, it made quitting much easier. I\u2019m going to step down to 3% in a few weeks, then nothing. I quit about three weeks ago, tried to smoke about a week in and threw it out three puffs in, I couldn\u2019t stop coughing and hated the smell. Drove home reeking of cigarettes but happy with the knowledge that I didn\u2019t want to smoke anymore.
p163
aVI agree with u/therealdannyking. Using nicotine now would be a step backwards. People report that stopping Juul is just as hard as quitting tobacco cigarettes.\u000a\u000aHave you been to [WhyQuit.com](http://whyquit.com/)? Watching Joel Spitzer videos about quitting really helped me. \u000a\u000aA craving won't kill you. You can handle it.
p164
aVI\u2019d rather use a Juul in the same way someone would use the patch (didn\u2019t work for me) or nicotine gum (didn\u2019t work for me either) than smoke. I guess I\u2019m weak for not being able to go cold turkey but I\u2019m really enjoy my cigarette free life and cutting back on the Juul to eventually be nicotine free. \u000a\u000aIf cold turkey works for you, more power to ya. Didn\u2019t work for me. This does, downvote me all you want. I\u2019m just happy to not smell like smoke and be short of breath constantly. 
p165
aVExperiencing the growing nicotine Dragon\u000a\u000aOk.  Why replacements arent working for me.  Maybe the do for some of you...but here is my experience.  I was just under a pack a day light cigarettes for a couple decades.  No major cough, health problems.  Wanted to stop, so...\u000a\u000aEnter Copenhagen and swedish snus.  Much more nicotine, get off cigs.  Not healthy but better than smoke.  I lived in rural America, its more common.  Dip all you want, at least your not smoking.  Take care of your mouth.  Then...\u000a\u000aRelapsed back to smoking.  This time bc I dipped i was smoking almost 2 packs a day!  Wanted to quit smoking again, so...\u000a\u000aEnter Juul and vaping.  Easy peasy, easy to quit smoking.  Vape all you want says the guy at the vape shops as they shake out of their bones taking in gargantuan amounts of nicotine.  So i did.  No cravings for smoke!  Thats cuz I prob tripled my nic intake.  If I were to start smoking it would probably be more than 2 packs a day now.  All this harm reduction stuff has made me a nicotine fiend, worse than when I was an actual smoker!\u000a\u000aThats why I neee to stop.  Everything.  Replacements never work for me, they make it worse.  
p166
aVI'm at 14 days. Used a juul so it's not quite as tough as cold Turkey. Good shit tho
p167
aVWhat is a juul? I don't know the term or product 
p168
aVHELP NEEDED, quit by Juuling and lost it on a trip.\u000a\u000aI started smoking when I was 12, I got a Juul in July to help me quit, and I haven\u2019t had a death stick in 3 months. I\u2019m now 17 and on a family trip in Atlanta, and I left my Juul at home. If anyone in Smyrna/Marietta can get me a starter kit, please PM me.
p169
aVTry juul, I used mine to quit smoking
p170
aVI have a juul, two actually. But I couldn\u2019t get a good enough hit off it it without choking to death. I found a really good pod that uses the same nic salts and it kinda helps. 
p171
aVThanks again, man.  I know I should, but I had stepped down to 0 mg vape, same thing- I was super happy until 18 hrs later.  Then...bam.  Had to hit 30 mg nic salts or juul.  Im just kinda tired of being addicted man.  And the stupid thing is i put the vape away last night so i wouldnt use it today.
p172
aVGot a juul\u000a\u000aHellooooo, everyone I just want to say I am happy to finally say I finally quit cigs and I am just using the juul for craving. 
p173
aVJUUL NO LONGER ABLE TO SELL FRUIT FLAVORS!?! FDA BAN!!!\u000a\u000a
p174
aVStruggle is real...\u000a\u000aHad last cig 3 weeks ago by vaping and juul.  Do not want to use anything anymore, no more nicotine.  I have read allen carrs book, and still struggling to not vape.  Any advice to help me?  I may be using MORE nicotine now, and I've had enough.
p175
aV20 year old that is hoping to slow down on smoking my Juul and weed\u000a\u000aNot sure if this is the subreddit that can help me but I\u2019ve been constantly thinking of quitting. \u000aI have started my 3rd year of uni and ive come to realize that my mental and psychical health have depleted a lot as I continue smoking. I used to work out and really get school work done but I\u2019ve realized that it\u2019s been slowing down my motivation.  \u000aI love smoking weed, it helps me once and a while but I know when I do my mind tells me that it was a a mistake and how I use the time after I smoke to do nothing. \u000aWith the Juul, I smoke at least a pod a day. It\u2019s making me lose money and the nic habit I\u2019ve created is really hard to let go. \u000a\u000aHonestly I guess I\u2019m here to see if you guys have any words or advice for me to start slowing down. I feel completely lost and my roommates aren\u2019t the best help. Thanks. \u000a
p176
aVA pod a day = a pack a day, maybe start cutting down on the juul.  If you want good grades weed will not help.  
p177
aVImho Juuls are the new cigarette nikki trap; there's more nicotine per hit and a pod equates to roughly a pack. Tbh i switches from a juul  to a Smok Novo, that way the pods are refillable so i have 1.5%-0% nic juice as opposed to the ~28% (? Correct me if im wrong) ina juul pod.\u000a\u000a\u000aI wish nothing but the best for you. As far as the electric lettuce goes I've always been able to find success if using it *specifically* as a reward for completing any and all schoolwork. Sooner or later you'll get in the habit and it will feel like a nice little treat. Do know that at our age (i, too, am facing just about the same situation as you lmao), being under the influence of thc while either in class or studying, *noticeably* better for information retention in my experience.  \u000a\u000a\u000aBest of luck all around 
p178
aVI've had a few relapses this past month, I need to update my days. I'm on Day 3 after my brother visited with a juul, and stupidly I got pretty into it as he was, and promptly was craving cigarettes like mad. I dont know how I was so dumb, I promise you that feeling wont last and gets easier to overcome with each day. Granted some triggers really whollup you, cant stand those. Like you think back on that moment of the day constantly and the aftershocks of cravings after.\u000a\u000aBut oof, oh man, boy howdy, it is so not worth it. My most recent relapses were for the most blatant of reasons. I'd be craving, having a mood, and think "oh fuck it I need a good boost right now". And it was like, by the end of the cig I saw all the days I went go up in smoke. It's such a shit feeling instead of satisfying, AND the negative emotion usually sets off a feeling to smoke again (at least for me)\u000a\u000aAbsolutely fuck those things. Keep fighting the good fight, I'm happy you're growing beyond them too!
p179
aVTry juul or General snus, or both. They can pack a nic wallop that might help you make the initial step of getting away from the cigarette.  Juul is a high nicotine vape that uses salts that are closer to the way a cig delivers.  
p180
aVI accidentally got addicted to nicotine and vaping.\u000a\u000aEver since I was a senior in high school and started partying whenever I would drink I would hit vapes because I like the buzz. Never really smoked cigs since I find them gross but now for the last couple weeks I started hitting juuls and I'm addicted now to nicotine. It's not too bad but recently I bought myself a vuse areo and I need help quitting before it gets worse. Does anyone have some tips on how to stop this before it gets to the point where I need nicotine?? I literally start to only become focused on it after not smoking it for a while. 
p181
aVWhat are you vaping?  As in, a gas station e-cig, or a Juul, or something from a cape store!
p182
aVSomething called \u201cminifit\u201d , juul isn\u2019t sold in my country. \u000a\u000a\u000aHowever it came highly recommended, 4 of my friends quit using it. \u000a\u000aHowever I also have general flu like symptoms, is it probably due to the vape, quitting smoking or bad luck and I got sick?\u000a
p183
aVJuuling/ vaping?\u000a\u000aSo I finally quit smoking cigarettes because I started using the Juul to substitute, it\u2019s worked really well so far and haven\u2019t bought or smoked cigarettes in months. I know juuls aren\u2019t great because they still contain nicotine but they\u2019re supposedly better than cigarettes because they don\u2019t contain tobacco or tar. I also don\u2019t feel like I have to smoke for a set amount of time (like committing to a whole cigarette) so I smoke for shorter amounts of time (a few hits) but more frequently throughout the day (because it\u2019s more accessible). I was wondering if anyone else does this/ other experiences with juuls/ vapes to quit smoking cigarettes? 
p184
aVThank you for your comment. I bought a Juul 8 days ago, and haven't had a cigarette since. It's been a challenge, constantly being around those who smoke, and going through some pretty major life challenges at the moment, change of job, moved, and a divorce at the same time .. so I have plenty of "reasons" to smoke.\u000a\u000aI finally found the secret after many many attempts: you just gotta keep trying, something will eventually stick. For me, it was the Juul, which i've been doing for a week now. At first I was probably vaping more than I was smoking, but at least I wasn't smoking. Last night, I sat around and had a few beers in a smoky room, and my Juul was out. I could've charged it, but I didn't. I saw cigarettes on the table, I could've taken one, but they looked and smelled disgusting. I absolutely love how I don't smell now like an ashtray.\u000a\u000aJuul does contain nicotine, but for me, it's all those other chemicals (I feel like at least) in cigarettes that also keep you hooked. I'm down to very little vaping and only have a few pods left, after that I'm done. Cigarettes have zero appeal to me, I'm so glad I'm past them, and I know Juul has some negative side effects as well, so I'm looking forward to quitting that. One step at time.\u000a\u000aAs long as you are always fighting to make progress, keep fighting, you'll get there. It's just like anything else that you have to work at in life.
p185
aVI know a lot of people come here seeking help to get off the Juul. They say that going from cigarettes to the Juul made them more addicted to nicotine. In terms of stopping addiction,,,,, switching to Juul seems to be frying pan to the fire.
p186
aVIt didn\u2019t work for me either. The first two times. Now, a couple years later I\u2019m using the Juul and it\u2019s working out really well. I have two little boys so my motivation is sky high. I want to live for them as long as possible. I want to live for myself as long as possible. I love smoking cigarettes, but I have to be mature and recognize that I can either have my life or the cigarettes. This time around trying to Juul I took a big a drag to start and told myself how well it hit and how good it tasted. I think it\u2019s all your mindset and approach. 
p187
aVI have an addictive personality, gambling, smoking, video games were the big ones (also drinking back in high school but that just kinda ended in its own). It takes a shit ton of will power and determination. One at time is the way I went and now all I have left is cigarettes (currently 1 month smoke free). A distraction is defiantly needed I chose fitness. For video games I started with 10 pushups after every death/level and then 10 pushups and 1 chore(I.e. dishes, make the bed, etc). Now instead of video games for day 2 hours it\u2019s workout for 1 hour followed by gaming for an hour(if I have time). The busier you are the easier it is to not think about the addictions. Also I refuse to go to casinos anymore(still havnt found a good one for that) I too struggle with anxiety but as I\u2019ve gone through this journey I\u2019ve learned that these addictions are just a crutch that actually make the anxiety worse in the long run\u000a\u000aSide note I do juul so I\u2019m not nicotine free yet but it\u2019s a start
p188
aVJuul dude, I can\u2019t recommend enough. I was a pack a day for 3 years and after a few days of using a juul I don\u2019t even want to smoke cigarettes anymore
p189
aVThe thing is your still dependent on nicotine bro \u000a\u000aIf you were to stop juuling you would go through withdrawals, doesn\u2019t that bother you mate that you\u2019ve trading your addiction for somethin a little bit more healthy 
p190
aVI\u2019m 19 yrs old and I quit 25 days ago. My first three weeks were quite similar to yours. Super high hunger, sex drive, bad insomnia. For the insomnia buy some melatonin, it helps regulate your sleep cycle and puts you to bed (take about 30 minutes before you sleep). \u000a\u000aThe sex drive and hunger fix themselves with time, just limit yourself as best as possible but don\u2019t blame yourself if you overconsume, it takes enough willpower not to smoke already.\u000a\u000aYou might eventually notice yourself getting more paranoid or anxious, but that\u2019s just another part of your body normalizing after quitting. The dopamine release from smoking helps with stress, therefore when you remove that, it makes it harder to deal with things that stress you out.\u000a\u000aI had peppermint toothpicks in my mouth a lot just to satisfy the habit of putting a juul in my mouth. It helped me a lot, maybe it could help you. Doesn\u2019t hurt to try they\u2019re like 3 bucks for 100 lol.\u000a\u000afeel free to pm me if you have any other questions or anything 
p191
aVExperience with Juul?\u000a\u000aSo I only recently found out about these things and it seems like they became some sort of a hype under younger people and also a meme for the internet.\u000a\u000aI've been smoking a pack (26 cigarettes) a day for the past 10 years and I want to quit for good now. I was wondering if anyone had experience with the Juul or similar vapes to help with that.\u000a\u000aWhat makes the Juul appealing to me is it's small size compared to other vapes. Most of the reviews I have watched however go over the thick clouds and the neat designs and whatever. I don't care the slightest about all of that, just want some support to quit smoking and prefferably not a big heavy machine.\u000a\u000aSo if anyone here has experience with the Juul or similar devices please share your thoughts on it. Thanks in advance.
p192
aVJust wanted to jump in so I could follow this conversation. I tried Vapes and they weren't for me, even the smaller pen shaped ones. Been thinking about trying a Juul to see if that works. 
p193
aVYeah, I'm a bit familiar with vapes in general but always found them so inconvinient because of their size and you had to refill them with juice and whatever, I just want to have a quick smoke when I have the urge to do so. I just ordered an overpriced Juul (they're hard to get here in the EU because of certain nicotine resteiction laws). I'll see how it goes. Every day I postpone buying one is \u20ac7,70 spent on a pack of cigarettes. It'll arrive next monday.
p194
aVAh I get quite a few days per refill on my vape, and it fits in my pocket- but I am considering buying a second much smaller one like a Juul or e-cigarette for times when I don\u2019t want to worry about the glass tank, or the bulky-ish mod.\u000a\u000aRegardless of what system you go for- I hope the vaping works for you! It\u2019s so nice not having to \u201cair out\u201d before talking to girls or whatever. And in Australia, a packet of Marlboro Reds cost nearly $40 AUD for a $25 pack if you buy it at a gas station instead of a supermarket.. I won\u2019t scare you by converting that to Euros but I\u2019ll just say this- you have it cheap over there..
p195
aVJuul helps you quit cigs but I found that I was even more hooked on that thing. If you just want to be done with cigs but don\u2019t mind being stuckon the nicotine still it\u2019s probably the best option.\u000a\u000aIt made me feel crazy though, I would hit it a few times when I got home and then I felt sick from the nicotine I think, would get a little headache and stomach upset. And then once that went away after 5 or 10 minutes I would grab the juul again. And repeat the process. Nicotine is a helluva drug. \u000a\u000aIt\u2019s probably not as bad as smoking, and  a bunch of my friends quit smoking and now only juul, but it just made me feel like I upgraded to cigs 2.0 and I didn\u2019t want to be a slave to any of it anymore.
p196
aVI concur w/ CrazyJo in that success is beating the addiction, not necessarily switching delivery mechanisms. \u000a\u000aThat said, I've found Juul (or vapes that use NicSalts) to be most like a hit from a cigarette - it is warm and mellow.  Problem with Juul is that it is 5mg's of Nicotine, which is very potent.  \u000a\u000aI used to smoke Juul's at work and cigarettes at home. Because Juul's are so potent it resolved my cigarette cravings, yet, over time it made me more addicted to Nicotine.  When I eventually quit cold turkey - in the office,  I craved the Juul as much as cigarettes (noting that I smoked for over 20 years - only smoking Juuls for the last 2!)         
p197
aVI have tried that too, you really need the right mindset for that. When I smoked the last cigarette of my pack and didn't buy a new pack (shops here close at 9pm, and city is a 15min drive) I was already stressing out after an hour of not smoking. When I'm at work I usually don't smoke for 4 hours before my break without much problem but just the thought that I didn't have any cigarettes left and that I will never get to smoke one again made me stress out so much faster. \u000a\u000aI think the Juul or any vape really can help a bit with that. I will receive it next monday. I will test it out, then put it away and I'll try to quit "cold turkey" but if the urge gets too big I will take the Juul instead of the cigarette.
p198
aVI used a juul for about 3 months before going cold turkey on all nicotine. I found it convenient and allowed me to have an in between stage. It's still nicotine, still addiction and all that. I did benefit from it though. 1 month completely free from nicotine! 
p199
aVI\u2019ve been using the juul for about a week. Still smoked a couple of cigarettes the first few days, but now have no desire to smoke a real cigarette even after a few drinks. The not smelling like smoke thing has really been positive reinforcement, since I was always self conscious of that. I like it. I\u2019m a little bothered that I\u2019m still hooked on nicotine but one step at a time is how I\u2019m looking at it
p200
aVYeah, I've been trying it for a bit now but to be honnest, if I don't smoke a single cigarette on a day, I smoke about 2,5 - 3 Juul pods which is still pretty expensive. So I bought some regular 50/50 E-Juice to refill them and that works, but I bought 12mg nicotine E-Juice and it's a bit too light in my throat (I'm not sure if that's because of the nicotine, I'll buy some 18mg soon and try that out) but I'm not really clear on how much nicotine these Juul pods contain because it says 3% or 6% and regular E-Juice displays it as mg's 3, 6, 12 or 18mg. Not sure which would be the equivalent of 6mg, definitely not the 6mg one.
p201
aVJuuling got me off cigarettes for a while. But even then I eventually had to put that down. No better alternative than good ol oxygen friend 
p202
aV15 days free of Nicotine(Use this as motivation)\u000a\u000aFifteen days ago I was extremely addicted to nicotine. I would vape 50nic from a Sourin. Would go through 2 ml a day (Equivilent to 2 packs of cigarettes based on nicotine content). It all started 4 years ago when I was a junior when I started to dip, and it started to be an every day habbit untill I quit dipping in September of 2017 and I decided to buy a juul.\u000a\u000aMy vaping problem was starting to be tough on my body. I always felt on edge, always felt wired.\u000a\u000aThen I made the decision to quit, and to change my life around. These 15 days have been sober from all stimulants. I feel absolutely amazing.\u000a\u000aI now have a girlfriend, we started talking 3 weeks ago, and I used her as my motivation to quit, because nicotine often caused me Impotence. Now I feel insanely healthy in all aspects of my life. I know I can't contribute all of these effects to nicotine abstinence. But what I can tell you guys is that your mind is powerful, and it can do and change things if you truely believe in yourself.\u000a\u000aI don't have cravings anymore. I know that everyone is different, but it really was not that hard for me. 
p203
aVI am 1 month 7 days and 3 hours. I used the vape with nicotine free juice and the 'smoke free' app.  The vap isn't becoming a habit but it is a bit of a crutch at this point. I nearly forgot to pack it this morning and had a mini panic. Having said that i will probably only use it twice - this is the habit or work stress induced reaction. The habit is getting more and more phazed out.  The vape is becoming less and less. I still have moods - sad, angry, any emotion.etc, but these are becoming less also. I don't think I would have made it to here without the vape... I got the juul - it's skinny, easy, doesn't leak, a$71Aust.
p204
aVI actually just bought a juul yesterday, I\u2019m hoping it will help in these next couple of weeks/month until I can wean off nicotine. I just know the smell and feel of cigarettes always pulls me back somehow :/
p205
aVOh man the coffee in the morning sounds like a fantastic idea. I\u2019ve never thought of the morning coffee ritual but thinking about it sounds so nice. Maybe a cup of tea or coffee and I can actually smell the nice morning smell of outside like I want to instead of just my cigarettes.\u000a\u000aSomething about the feel and smell of cigarettes just doesn\u2019t compare to vaping but I caved in and bought a juul yesterday to wean off cigs so I\u2019m REALLY hopeful it will help with socializing and my breaks as well. \u000a\u000aWonderful advice, thank you!\u000a
p206
aVThat's what I did too, I made a plan to drop the juul on day 30, I suggest you do something similiar as quiting nicotine was way harder for me than quiting cigarettes. But also without the juul I don't know if I would have been able to drop cigs completely. Just some food for thought
p207
aVYea I\u2019m definitely a tiny bit worried about the nicotine because the juul actually gave me a rush as opposed to vape mods I\u2019ve tried. But I\u2019ll be happy if it stops me from smoking 12-15 cigarettes a day. \u000a\u000aI\u2019m so proud that you dropped the juul after a month though! Nicotine is such a bitch to drop completely, I hope I can have as much self motivation as you.
p208
aVYou can do all of the same things without smoking - or vaping. Go outside and have 10 minutes to yourself. I still do that. Go out and socialize with others while they smoke and you don't. I do that too. Anything you can do as a smoker, you can do as a non-smoker. \u000a\u000aBe careful with the Juul. The nicotine content is so high that many people become more addicted to nicotine than when they smoked tobacco.
p209
aVI\u2019ll admit I\u2019m in school and I wasn\u2019t able to resist so I took a hit from a juul. But I made a promise to myself that it\u2019s my last hit. 
p210
aVBest tips to quit?\u000a\u000aI've  juul about a pod a day for the past year and I'm ready to drop it completely.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aI'm honestly scared for the withdrawals that are to come, but could someone give me tips on how to help it?\u000a\u000aAlso, how long do you think my withdrawals will last? Is this going to be a battle for a week? Month? Year?
p211
aVI don't know what a juul or a pod is, but if it's anything like cigarettes, then you should have withdrawals of about a month. Give or take a few weeks depending on your usage and so on. Drinking plenty of water/fluids and keeping yourself busy is the best way to get through quitting smoking.
p212
aVIts an e-cig. a "pod" of juul is equivalent to a pack of cigarettes nicotine
p213
aVTry your juul with a NO nicotine juice.? 
p214
aVI had been juuling a pod a day as well, and lurked in this sub to help me through my quit. Honestly, just go cold turkey. Throw away all your pods and the juul itself, i kept telling myself to save it for parties, but don't.  \u000a\u000aThe biggest part that helped me is understanding that it isnt worth a 15-second buzz for the severity of the addiction and all the expenses.\u000a\u000aKeep in mind the longer you quit, the less you'll want a hit.\u000a\u000aBest of luck.

aVI went cold turkey. \u000a\u000aJuul is a safer alternative to smoking, but if you search in this sub there are many folks posting about trying to break the addiction of using Juul. It appears a lot of people actually increase nicotine consumption. \u000a\u000aMaybe try cold turkey first? With any addiction, you\u2019re going to have to do the hard work regardless. NRT\u2019s are just guides to help. 
p218
aVIt's working for me. I used it to quit and have went from using their strongest (5%) pods down to 3% pods. I plan to step down to a different pod device soon as Juul doesn't offer 0% nicotine pods yet.
p219
aVI started Juul during the day and smoke blunts at night, does this mean I have kicked cigs?\u000a\u000a
p220
aVHell yah Less Harm is good. I hit the bong too. Really trying to stay away from the cigs and the Juul has worked. Idk but thanks 
p221
aVI don\u2019t think this is popular in this sub but I usually smoke weed or hit a JUUL pen if I really need to smoke something. 10/10 times it helps.\u000a\u000aWith a Juul you\u2019re having nicotine and for some this could be a pitfall, but you\u2019re also not having the 100 other chemicals included in a cigarette. Plus its vapor, not smoke, since theres no combustion, so it\u2019s just a lot better for you in comparison. Vaping and smoking are very different tastes. I can\u2019t smell stand the smell of a cigarette anymore, so I\u2019m not sure if one leads back to the other.\u000a\u000aWeed curbs my oral fixation, and I smoke weed anyway, so I just do it when I feel any craving. 
p222
aVThose juuls are dangerous. Awesome job!
p223
aVJust threw my last pack off my balcony.\u000a\u000aYesterday I went out and bought a Juul. I still had most of a pack left and I rationalized it, I said "I've already spent the money so I'll just smoke these and not buy any more."\u000a\u000aWoke up this morning craving. The Juul wasn't doing the job quick enough and I really wanted to go light up. Instead I threw the pack into the woods behind my apartment.\u000a\u000aI can do this. I have to do this. 
p224
aVGood for you! Let me know how the Juul works for you - been considering it myself.
p225
aVI was addicted to vaping, most recently a Juul, for 5 years before my current quit attempt.  Juuls are wayyy higher in nicotine than cigarettes are.  Don't use a Juul.  Use another form of NRT.  I'm struggling my ass off to keep myself from running out and buying another Juul to make this nicotine craving go away.
p226
aVMy current plan is to finish the starter pack, buy one round of refills at the 3% concentration, then get a small pen vape and some nic-free juice. The way I look at it, this is not a replacement for smoking. It's a tool to help me quit. If I just switch from spending money on cigarettes to spending money on Juul pods, I'm not really any better off. 
p227
aVthe patch is meant to quit not to reduce your consumption but I understand what you are feeling because a couple of years ago I do the same and it was really stupid.    I reduce my consumption with a juul e cigarrette,  they are simple and work great,  with that thing I was able to go from 1 pack a day to just 1 or 2 cigarretes a day,   after 1 or 2 weeks I went full on vape and I really liked,   after almost 5 months with the vape I start cutting down the vape and it was way easier than before.  I still use the vape but just on weekend and when I'm drinking,  my next goal is to quit vape\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aSo,  my recommendation is try the vape
p228
aVI quit 22 days ago using the juul I\u2019ve tried vaping before and only lasted 4 months but man this Juul is really working for so I\u2019d suggest looking into a cigalike vape
p229
aVSuggestions to quit vaping?\u000a\u000aI started vaping to quit smoking. A little bit of a background, I was an occasional smoker (smoked only with friends and while drinking) \u000a\u000aMy motivations to quit smoking were\u000a\u000a* The after smell - I used to hate how my lips, finger and clothes smelled after I smoked\u000a* Wanted to smoke in places I couldn't - Since I always chose to keep my house smoke free, I could never "enjoy" my cigarette. I used to feel the urge to smoke while having my morning cup of coffee and watching the news, while having a drink or while reading a book on the couch\u000a* It kills you - I like to live a healthy life and couldn't bear the feeling that I was killing myself after every cigarette I smoked\u000a\u000a\u000aSince I started vaping I could pretty much do all of the above (except the killing part which might be debatable). The great thing was that I could also vape in bars/indoors. As long as you don't rip clouds, no one really cared. I used to discretely vape my juul. Hell, I would even go to the bathroom and vape at work, get my nicotine kick and not have to worry about stepping out in brutal cold or my clothes smelling.\u000a\u000aMy motivation to quit is that I am now vaping constantly. I definitely get withdrawals when I havent vaped. Also, because I only vape closed tank systems (i.e. you dont need to fill in e-liquid, change the tank/atomizer blah blah) it gets expensive pretty quick. \u000a\u000aHas anyone successfully quit vaping and can share their thoughts/experiences? Would really appreciate it.
p230
aVI use a Juul. Yes, there's nicotine and I intend on quitting that soon, but i haven't smoked in 7 weeks. Not a cigarette, a drag, nothing. And I have 0 desire for a cigarette, just nicotine right now. \u000a\u000aObviously I'm still addicted to nicotine but I was smoking cigarettes for 10 years and longest before the Juul was 24 hours for me.\u000a\u000aSo without Juul, 24 hours.\u000aWith Juul, 7 weeks strong 
p231
aVYes. I am 22 I've been smoking since I was 16 and got a juul, it took me about the first 3-4 days before i got used to it and stopped smoking cogs. Haven't had a cog in almost 2 months. It sucks because because I still spend as much but I can definitely notice a diffrence in smelling and breathing, I dont mind still being addicted honestly just as long as it's not cigs so I dont smell like complete garbage.
p232
aVI've been refilling the pods and it saves a ton of money, but it doesn't compare to the pod juice quality unfortunately. I smoke the cool mint pods and I use a spearmint nicotine salt juice to refill but still doesn't compare to the lovely peppermint Juul pods.\u000a\u000aStill think it's better to smoke these, than to inhale Chems and carbon monoxide. 
p233
aVGreat job man. You inspire me. I'm on day 12 of no cigs (using a Juul as NRT) but it's been a challenge. My energy level is actually low, I always feel tired. Hopefully its just a phase but Im going to stick with it. 
p234
aVSorry dude but this makes no sense .you are probably putting more nicotine in your body with the juul then you did with cigarettes .\u000aNicotine withdrawals causes withdrawals and low energy DEFINATELY not withdrawals from chemicals,carbon monoxide and tar.(quite the opposite)\u000aYour phase sounds psychological not physical .realise that and you'll get out of it .
p235
aVHelp, I want to start smoking again\u000a\u000aHi, I\u2019m 18 and smoked for 3 years, on the first of November I\u2019ll be 6 months without smoking and about 2~ months without vaping (vaped for 4 years or so, give or take). When people smoke near me I remember the good times I had while smoking and how much I enjoyed it. I really liked it but I had to hide it from my parents. Now when I get offered one I always say no but in the inside I\u2019m like I want oneee! I get the temptation to smoke again, I really enjoyed it, going out for a smoke with friends was great and I really enjoyed just smoking. I enjoyed it more than vaping. I have also frequent temptations to go back to vaping but I enjoyed vaping a lot less than I did smoking because when vaping I necer tasted the flavors, they were like tasteless to me so I didn\u2019t really enjoy it as much but I did like it. Damn, I miss smoking, a lot. But it was hard to quit, not that hard because I had a JUUL, quitting that thing was fucking hard, I remember after starting to quit I was craving so much that I vaped the tiny amount left on the pods, that was hard AF. But now I get the temptation to start again. Maybe I\u2019ll start vaping because that\u2019s a lot less harmful than smoking and it wasn\u2019t as hard to stop vaping 3mg, it wasn\u2019t pleasant but not very hard. I do like not being dependant of something but I also liked vaping. It was something to do. \u000a\u000aI need some reassurance and tips.\u000a\u000aTl;Dr \u000aNeed reassurance to not start smoking again or vaping. I\u2019m 18 smoked for 3 years vaped for 4 and quit smoking 6 months ago and vaping like 2 months ago. Tempted, very tempted to start again, mainly start vaping again at least. I do like not being dependant of something but also liked to smoke.
p236
aVWhat are the first steps to quitting?\u000a\u000aHey everyone. I\u2019m new here. I guess I\u2019ll start where I was at my worst with nicotine. \u000a\u000aLast year I was in the states playing hockey, chewing tobacco was extremely cheap. At the worst I was chewing two tins a day, this lasted for about a week until I found Satan\u2019s own USB stick, otherwise known as the Juul. It got me off chew instantly, but I am more hooked on it than I ever was on chew. I don\u2019t even know how to begin to quit. Should I try to cold turkey it? Or should I just lessen my intake over the month? Any advice will help as I\u2019m pretty tired of being a slave to this stupid device. I was never a cigarette smoker, but I\u2019m hoping you all can help me out. Thank you in advance. 
p237
aVHey I\u2019m proud of you! That\u2019s a long time and takes strength. \u000a\u000aI vape currently too. The terrifying, scary juul. But it\u2019s helping me right now so much, oh gosh. \u000a\u000aThankfully that slip up repulsed me a lot more than pulling me in!
p238
aVThanks OP, I am also proud of you! You got this\u000a\u000aFrankly, I would opt for a real mod instead of a juul, or at least one where you can put your own juices. The juul pods have alooot of nicotine and with a regular mod you can eventually ween yourself off of it. Also you're gonna pay slot more in the long run for pods than you would with coils and juice 
p239
aVNot sure if it\u2019s frowned upon to talk about products but I tried everything to quit smoking. Like everything I could find. Gum, laser, acupuncture, hypnosis, Chantix, cold turkey and the patch. The JUUL finally did the trick. Been a week and have zero desire for a smoke. 
p240
aVWhat's JUUL?
p241
aVJuul is amazing. I quit smoking the night I took up with my Juul, 5 months without cigarettes. My voice is back,  no cig smell, can Juul anywhere. 
p242
aVHey, I\u2019ll take it. I\u2019ve been smoking for decades and have tried quitting countless times over the years. This is the first time I\u2019ve ever felt like I can comfortably not smoke. The JUUL gives me the muscle memory and still gives me the nicotine, the ritual and routine of a cigarette. I know it\u2019s not getting over the habit but it\u2019s cutting out the majority of the bad stuff. Things on fire are really bad for you. I\u2019m to the point where it\u2019s gotta stop at all costs. So I will take the JUUL and run with it. It feels like I\u2019m having a smoke. 
p243
aVDude this is awesomely encouraging! Congrats! My buddy kicked cigs with the JUUL and I saw a CBS report about vaping versus smoking and the JUUL was talked about specifically. I bought one the next day and seriously haven\u2019t looked back. I tried a cigarette after going without for two days and holy shit it felt and tasted awful. I grinned ear to ear because I knew it was actually working and my days with cigarettes are over. 
p244
aVI haven't tried the Juul because you are still addicted to nicotine so it's just transferring the addiction. Cold turkey is the way to go in my opinion. 
p245
aVNah it was a juul. You can see him using it on other shows too
p246
aVI quit all nicotine 60 days ago.\u000a\u000aI have smoked for 30+  years, and on the 1st of January I bought a juul and stopped smoking.  60 days ago I gave away my juul to a coworker and stopped all nicotine altogether.\u000a\u000aI quit once before for about 7 years, and \u201cjust one smoke\u201d turned into another 4 years of cigarettes. I will never touch a cigarette again.\u000a\u000aI just wanted to share with someone. 
p247
aVHow was it stopping the juul? Did h quit cold Turkey or force yourself to ween off it?
p248
aVYou can do it without. The hardest thing to get your head around is \u201cnever again\u201d. \u000a\u000aI liked my juul a lot too, but I knew I had to stop. It was a means to an end, not a shiny hobby. \u000a\u000aBe careful with that chantix. 
p249
aVNice! I've been tobacco free 5 weeks but leaning on a juul when I drink. Hoping to be off that soon too
p250
aVI know a juul pod..is 5% nic..and has 200 puffs. So 5 hits of a juul is more or less equal to a cig. Don't know if that helps you in the slightest but yeah. 
p251
aVThank you for taking the time to reply to me. I had to google what a juul pod is and i'm not sure this information helps me too much (or perhaps i'm not smart enough to work out a conversion) but I do appreciate you replying to my post :) 
p252
aVI've been smoke free for 28 days using the juul\u000a\u000aI know, i know. But i smoked pretty heavily for 13 years and I have tried and failed multiple times cold turkey. I am having great success by using the juul. I've been very mindful of the amount of nicotine in each pod and have been using the juul as conservatively as possible. I'll taper off of this with a vape of some kind and then hopefully i'll finally break the cycle of nicotine completely.\u000a\u000aHaving said all of the above, for those of you who have used a Juul to quit, when did you start to feel better? I can tell you my lungs are functioning so much better than they have in the past 13 years. I can smell things and taste things. The negative of this is my anxiety has gone through the roof. I'm tired all the time. I'll get headaches every now and again. I just feel like i'm always withdrawing from something despite my Juul usage. Some days are definitely better than others. I have no idea what this could be, but maybe others have had a similar experience?
p253
aVI believe in you! You got this! Maybe consider a juul or a vape so you can \u2018smoke\u2019 with him without falling back on cigarettes. 
p254
aVJuul is harder to stop than regular cigs bc you can puff it literally anywhere and it becomes a pacifier of sorts. Expensive as shit too. Avoid
p255
aVI quit smoking cigarettes and moved over to the Juul about 2 months ago. I had no idea how I was going to get myself off of that after. Then I was diagnosed with mono 2 and a half weeks ago. Ended up in the hospital and my tonsil swelled up to a ridiculous size. BUT I'm no longer using a Juul now! Worked out in the end.
p256
aVJUUL is worse?\u000a\u000aHey all,\u000a\u000aIt has been three days since i quit smoking and I replaced it with JUUL. i have not been craving real cigarettes at all. But do you guys think JUUL will be even more addicting? (considering the amount of nicotine in there). Some say it is better than actual cigs because JUUL lacks the tar and other harmful chemicals. But then again, no real long term study has been conducted on JUUL.\u000a\u000a 
p257
aVI just tossed my juul in the trash last night. Here's the biggest problem with them, it's immediate satisfaction. For me, while working, I would try reaching small goals or solid stopping points before I went outside to have a cigarette (trying to keep it in check, making sure to not smoke more than a half a pack a day). But with the juul, you just pick it up, inside or outside, and because it doesn't smell, you become less and less conscious about it. It may be less harmful, but I found it more addicting for that reason. Also, 1 pod is essentially 1 pack of cigarettes, I would go through a pod in 24hrs, but I could make a pack of cigarettes last closer to 72hrs. So I ended up spending more on juul pods than I ever did on smokes, a lose-lose for me, personally.\u000aBeen smoking for 9yrs, had the juul for about 2months, hated it, never found it nearly as satisfying, and it just felt really lame. Just smoke or don't smoke. And yes, I am having brutal cravings as I type this, but it's satisfying to get it out.
p258
aV8 days...\u000a\u000aI feel so sick. Every smell makes me nauseas and my guts are soooo messed up. Have a Juul but don\u2019t use it much. Any tips for helping the nausea ? Vaping CBD has helped a lot with anxiety
p259
aV12 years a smoker &amp; 5 years a vaper. Day 30 of being a non-smoker &amp; non-vaper. Please help, I am still craving nicotine !\u000a\u000aHello everybody, this is the first time I am posting on reddit, and I do so out of sheer desperation.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aI am hoping to get some advice from fellow ex-vapers/ex-smokers in order to motivate me to keep this attempt to quit going. Just so that you guys can learn a little about my addiction, I have smoked and vaped simultaneously. The vaping had decreased the number of cigarettes I smoked from 40 per day to 20 per day, but this came as a doubled edged blade as my puff count was around 800-1000 per day which entailed the consumption of 15-20 ml per day. I would day that vaping/smoking simultaneously has costed me around 200 US dollars a month, which I consider a lot of money but this did not bother me. \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aFavourite brand (s) of cigarettes - Stuyvesant blue, Dunhill switch and Marlboro beyond blue\u000a\u000aCurrent vape device - Zues dual RTA with Asmodus Lustro 200W + Drop RDA with Smoant Charon Mini 225W\u000a\u000aFavourite Juice- Nasty juice (Trap Queen) and Blueberry Jam monster\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aThis is attempt number 10 000 to quit smoking as far as I know (you tend to lose count of the number of attempts eventually), and each time I have quit and started again then the following attempt becomes even more difficult. I must admit, on this "final" attempt to quit, I have cheated with the assistance of Allen Carr's easy way to stop smoking audiotapes. His power of suggestion into freeing the mind of the brainwashing that smoking has caused, is truly enlightening.\u000a\u000aAnyway, the crux of my problem is that I KNOW cigarettes are bad for your health due to the tar...carcinogens...cancer...blah blah blah! These are powerful reasons to stop smoking. HOWEVER, vaping is described as this completely healthy and "magical-unicorn" alternative to smoking. With something that is described to have no ill side effects and is being advertised to be so cool and sophisticated (example - JUUL), how am I able to quit vaping? \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aI must admit...I see myself as a drug addict. That feeling I get when I was down to my last cigarette or the feeling I get when my bottle of ejuice finished and I had none left. I hate smoking and vaping, and I wish to be FREE OF THIS ADDICTION. \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aAfter 30 days, I find that I do not crave the cigarette but I crave VAPING. What do I do ???\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aThank you for taking the time to read my post. \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;
p260
aVGo to zero nic and refuse to give in, before long you wont want the vape. Juul is prime example of how willfully ignorant the vaping community is, it is not a magical unicorn of safety despite what they claim. 
p261
aVHaven\u2019t smoked since last Tuesday.... longest ive gone cold turkey since I started smoking\u000a\u000aRecently I\u2019ve been trying to work towards being more active and trying to continue to get in better shape. I decided to try mma and took my first class Tuesday. After about ten minutes in, I was humbled. We had only warmed up and everybody else was standing around with their hands on their hips breathing steadily and talking amongst each other while I was sitting on the floor trying to avoid blowing chunks and trying to regain control of my breath without anybody noticing ( it didn\u2019t work, I\u2019m pretty sure I sounded similar to a dying whale) . It hit me then that if I were to continue this that there\u2019s absolutely no way in hell I could continue smoking cigs\u000a\u000a\u000aSo, for once, I decided to try to quit cold turkey. I\u2019ve made it since Tuesday and even though I feel like major shit and can hardly stand to be anybody due to irritability, I also am finally starting to feel good again too and extremely motivated \u000a\u000aThe last few times I quit I used a juul to help but ended up going back to cigs later on. I\u2019m hoping this time I can stick with it 100% nicotine free. \u000a\u000a\u000aI didn\u2019t really have any specific intention writing this other than to share my progress and possibly maybe give somebody else encouragement. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m anywhere near in the clear yet but I\u2019m getting more and more confident that I might actually be done for good this time.\u000a\u000a\u000aAlso,  This site ( https://whyquit.com/whyquit/A_Benefits_Time_Table.html ) has really helped me to continue to abstain by looking at the time table and using it as a reminder to myself on why I should quit this bullshit while I still can. Wish me luck :)
p262
aVWhy not? There are easier alternatives. E-cigs lieke Juuls relieved me, and it was MUCH easier to get off from e-cigs that it was cigs for me.\u000a\u000aEverybody is different but substituting a cigarette for a swisher is kind of taking a step backwards. It's like quitting smoking for chew. It's still the same exact thing in different form.
p263
aVI lost count\u000a\u000aI\u2019m quitting again. My record is 5 months, but man cigarettes have been an emotional crutch for nearly 10 years. I\u2019m 24 now though, and I have to kick this habit. Funny enough when I got on Wellbutrin for depression, my smoke cravings skyrocketed. I know some would disagree but I have been relying on an ecig and a juul to get through, which always work until I get myself into a smoking situation. \u000a\u000aThis sub has been great for fueling motivation! Last smoke was yesterday evening. I have to stay away from the devil\u2019s brew too, I could probably kill a pack in a night out if I drink;; \u000a\u000aAnyway, after lurking a while I\u2019m here to hold myself accountable 
p264
aVI have, this is how I quit! I told myself the day I started e-cigging that I would stop e-cigging one month later, and I did. I really feel like getting rid of the cig hand movements and all the weird habits  helped me a ton. But I'm not gonna lie, dropping the nicotine completely was harder for me then switching to e-cig. BUT I was using the juul ecig during that month and those things are loaded with nicotine. It wasn't till day 27 or so that I started to wein off the Nicotine.\u000a\u000aI just bought a Pixel 3XL 128 GB with the money I saved not smoking.\u000a\u000aI highly recommend setting a quit date and telling people it.\u000a \u000aYOU GOT THIS!\u000a\u000aOne more thing, I had two juuls, on day 31, I hid them from myself, like out of sight out of mind. 1 was placed in my glovebox and the other in a pocket in my work backpack. I think after day four I was so confident I sold them off and never looked back.\u000a\u000aYOU CAN DO IT!
p265
aVhow long will i feel like absolute crap if i quit cold turkey\u000a\u000ai feel like such a junkie, i just rummaged through the trash for old juul pods because i couldn't handle the withdrawals. I already have mental health issues, and picked up smoking as an alternative to self-harm. It almost feels like i can't live without nicotine. pretty soon i'll be out completely so i don't have much choice but to quit cold turkey because im currently unemployed and my family refuses to buy me anything else to feed my addiction. I'm more worried that it will spike my depression terribly than the withdrawals themselves.
p266
aVIt absolutely does work this way.  Had a Juul pod leak a decent amount, it was mint so I could feel it all over my lips.  Got a real big buzz.  That being said, highly don't recommend, dosing would be out the window at that point and you're priming yourself to be even more addicted.
p267
aVtbh my juul pods leak a lot into my mouth because i refill them a few times before tossing them, never huge amounts though, and i've never felt a buzz from them. they only taste nasty and numb the mouth/lips. 
p268
aVThe time I was referencing it was indeed a very large amount.  I've had leaks but this was the mother load.  I guess I could've been expecting a high and felt that way as such, but I distinctly remember feeling like I'd just smoked hookah for an hour rather than just puffed a Juul a few times.
p269
aVMy wife made me wash my hands and brush my teeth every time I came in from a smoke... but the only thing that really works is wanting to quit.  I got myself a juul, works great for me.  I tried to back to cigs after using a juul for a few months and couldn't stand the taste anymore.  Now I just gotta quit the juul.... ugh
p270
aVDo you think using the juul makes you smoke more?
p271
aVI still need to quit juul 
p272
aVI still make myself Juul in the garage and on the back porch just like I did when I smoked. It's helped me not constantly hit it and kinda reprogram me. 
p273
aVMy mission today to post to you guys, but 5 days ago I bought a juul and you guys told me to download this app....\U0001f44a\U0001f3fc\u000a\u000a
p274
aVIf you know you're going to relapse, you could at least do it with a vape. Suorin, Juul, Smok Rolo all feel close to a cigarette when you use strong nicotine salts. That's what I'm doing right now. I'm considering smoking an emergency that needs to stop immediately, and I can deal with quitting the vape eventually. I just know myself and going cold turkey is a bad plan for me. 
p275
aVThe thing is I haven\u2019t been sweating at all. I still juul so I haven\u2019t been getting any nicotine withdrawal symptoms. I also drink ALOT of water
p276
aVI do both. I drink in bursts after taking some vape puffs because it makes me thirsty but I\u2019m usually drinking water constantly throughout the day.\u000a\u000aMaybe it\u2019s the juul adding to the problem?
p277
aVJuul?
p278
aVA thoughtful review on switching to JUUL\u000a\u000aI want to say up front that I have no communication or relationship with Juul. I discovered it last year when a friend let me try their Juul at a music festival. The hit was so different that I immediately bought one but subsequently moved to Europe for 6 months, where I was unable to get Juul pods, so I put it aside and kept smoking cigarettes. \u000a\u000aWhen I moved back from Europe (after an especially indulgent and beautiful stint in Amsterdam) I decided that I was going to quit smoking cigarettes. The transition and being back around friends and family was  a natural motivation to quit \u2013 but I didn't think I could go full turkey so I decided to switch to the Juul. \u000a\u000aLet me start out by saying that the hit from the Juul is completely different from cigarettes. As someone who identifies with having an inclination for addictive behavior, I immediately became fascinated with the entire Juul experience. The immediate disassociation with smoking and the smell, the shame, the complication of it all is amazing. I didn't have to worry about getting my fix around people who would disapprove of my habit. And at the same time, the hit is strong \u2013 it provides this momentary lapse of focus and relaxation. It's strange to explain if you haven't tried it.\u000a\u000aSounds great right? But immediately I recognized this as the downside as well. I could smoke anytime. I didn't have to wait for breaks to go outside or opportune moments to enjoy a cigarette. Almost a disadvantage \u2013 I  didn't have to create moments to step outside and appreciate the outside world, meet strangers, etc. \u2013 all the things I love about smoking.\u000a\u000aI'll say that I typically smoked about a pack a week or 5 days. Not heavy by my gauge. I enjoyed a beer and a smoke, a social cigarette, the end of the night cigarette. This certainly fluctuated and was higher at times, but for the most part that was my speed.\u000a\u000aAnyway, it's been 2 months since I've been back in the US and I'm proud to say that I haven't had a cigarette or even felt the need/craving for a cigarette. That's my biggest surprise \u2013 I don't miss the smell, I don't miss the judgement and the Juul completely satisfies that need for a certain kick throughout the day. I mostly regard it as a great replacement. I appreciate the design of the Juul and the thought that went into building it / creating a great device. But I'm also aware of its constant presence in my life now. \u000a\u000aWith the Juul, they say that one pod is equal to one pack. I easily smoke one pod a day now. It's constantly in my pocket or hand \u2013 or within reach. I find myself continuously clicking the pod in and out of the device, to get rid of the air bubbles around the wick so that it will deliver a stronger hit (which probably also decreases the duration of the pod). It's fucking expensive! I mean, they're geniuses for creating an addictive product \u2013 but each Juul pod pack (4 pods) costs at least $20-$25 where I am. I tried switching to third party pods this week after discovering they exist but they didn't deliver the same hit or the same satisfaction \u2013 the plastic, the form, everything about it was off compared to the original pods for me. I actually went a day without smoking because I liked it so much less (which gives me hope I can quit completely).\u000a\u000aSo that's that. I'm happy I've quit cigarettes and found an alternative. I'm worried I've found a more addicting and expensive habit in turn. Would love to know other people's thoughts and experiences with it!

aVI know what you mean and I feel the same - there\u2019s a distinct early culture around people that vape and despite what I think you mean, I don\u2019t see myself being part of that culture.\u000a\u000aThe juul vapor isn\u2019t designed to be big and obnoxious. I don\u2019t blow o rings or do other vape tricks. I don\u2019t talk about it or show it publicly, despite writing about it here. I guess I hide it in a way, like I did with smoking - but it\u2019s still my little escape/reward/addiction.\u000a\u000aI get there are risks. But that\u2019s why I came here for perspective.

p280
aVThis was actually very similar to my experience with JUULs. They function well from a harm reduction perspective but I never considered myself \u201ccured\u201d while using them.\u000a\u000aAfter about 2 years on them I recognized that I was taking in way more nicotine than I was with cigarettes because I could use them any time and anywhere. I recognized that this higher dose of nicotine was causing me heightened anxiety and I decided to quit JUULs / nicotine all together.\u000a\u000aQuitting JUULs is just as hard as quitting cigarettes but without the immediate reward of not smelling like an ashtray all the time.\u000a\u000aI can\u2019t say they didn\u2019t help because I switched to them before I quit and here I am 6 months nicotine free. I\u2019d just be mindful about how frequently you find yourself puffing on them and recognize that just because you\u2019re breathing easier doesn\u2019t mean that they aren\u2019t harming your mind / body in other ways.

aVwhat is it? It looks kinda like a juul .
p283
aVI would say it is better than JUUL, smoother and much better quality product. \u000a\u000aIt's called [RELXPod](https://www.relxpod.com). My high school friend recommended to me. I was told this the most popular vape product in Asia. 
p284
aVEvery single post/comment from your account created 3 days ago is spamming your JUUL ripoff. I think it's absolutely safe to assume you're just a spam account.
p285
aVI shamefully fall into the Juul in the bathroom group. I get headaches if I don\u2019t do it every 4 hours and there is no way I\u2019ll make it a full day without it 
p286
aVCommunity Pressure\u000a\u000aI lost track on how long I\u2019ve gone without smoking, I haven\u2019t smoked in about 6 months approximately. \u000a\u000aNow here is the thing I live in the Middle East, and the majority of people there smoke, you see cigarettes packs everywhere, everyone on the streets is holding a cigarette, it\u2019s so casual. Nearly every relative smokes and every student at my school \u201cjuuls\u201d.\u000a\u000aso here I am having internal social pressures which lead to craving a cigarette, I don\u2019t know where this craving came from as I haven\u2019t touched a cigarette for 6 months and counting, I\u2019m having really intense cravings. I go out for runs and I\u2019m overall a healthy person but I also want to say fuck it and buy a pack of cigarettes and start smoking like everyone else in my community.
p287
aVToday marks day one....I\u2019ve tried to quit before many times but life always makes it suck i have used vapes and quit for 4 months once so today I bought a Juul and hopefully after a few months to a year can quit that\u000a\u000a
p288
aVYou got this, OP! I just celebrated 3 months smoke fre thanks to my juul. They\u2019re gonna be releasing 3% pods soon to help wane off altogether. My dad is two weeks in since I bought him one and he\u2019s smoked for like 40 years, heavily. \u000a\u000aStay strong. All you gotta do is what you\u2019re doing right now: not smoking. 
p289
aVI can relate to this post. Smoking triggered my anxiety as well. I\u2019ve been cigarette free for about a month and nicotine free for a few days. I recommend you buy a vape \u2014 I used the JUUL vape. If stopping entirely is difficult then buy the vape and use the vape for awhile. I waited until my vacation to quit cigarettes and switch to vaping and then quit vaping. You need time to detox. Also bear in mind that it takes awhile for your brain to reboot and not expect the dopamine fix and stimulating effects of nicotine. You will experience fatigue, anxiety, fear, paranoia, etc. But as each day passes it gets easier. Not everyone can quit cold turkey: cigarettes are said to be as addictive or MORE addictive than heroine. Know that by defeating this addiction you will truly be a much better version of yourself. Your confidence will sky rocket. You will have energy to live life. You will realize how disgusting nicotine / smoking is. I know I did. Hope that helps. 
p290
aVTry a MTL (Mouth-to-Lung) Vape-Pen and use very high nicotine e-liquid (18-24mg/ml) or even go to the pod-systems with up to 50mg/ml nicotine (Juul or others) but MTL devices plus high nicotine is better and cheaper.\u000a\u000aEverything but cigarettes.

aVIm underage and trying to quit JUUL for my friends\u000a\u000aHello. I\u2019m 15 and created a throwaway for obvious reasons. My parents dont know anything about this and have no idea i would do anything like this. I didnt have any clue i would do it either. I understand this post might not be allowed because im underage but i really want to quit and my friends dont really know how to support me since they have never dealt with a situation like this before.\u000a\u000aI started juuling a few weeks ago. I knew nothing about juul or vape. I saw a guy showing off his juul and i was having a shitty week so i said fuck it and asked for one. I payed him and he got me one with a few pods. At first i started doing it once every few days and it was nice. But recently ive been doing it multiple times a day. I learned how to hide smoke and use alot less hits to get high. Yesterday i got high the most in one day, 5 times. Today i got high 3 times so far. \u000a\u000aI\u2019m a little worried about myself but i\u2019m mainly trying to quit for my friends. I have barely anyone to talk to in high school and we dont talk alot but i do have online friends. They are pretty much all i have at the moment and if they left me i would be devastated and would fall into a deeper hole of depression. \u000a\u000aI just don\u2019t know what to do. What if i can\u2019t quit even after all the support? Addiction is so much harder than i thought. Like i really wanna stop but it feels good and i love the dizzy buzz feeling i get from the juul. \u000a\u000aNot only is it the good feeling i get, but now a bunch of random people are asking me for a hit, and people think i\u2019m cool. I have never been a popular or cool kid at all and it\u2019s a good feeling that people actually like me and think i\u2019m cool because of it.\u000a\u000aIt really sucks. I could explain every bit of temptation i get but you guys already have had experience from it obviously. Hopefully you will be able to help me? I dont know maybe im a lose cause.\u000a\u000aAlso, i asked a guy for cherry blast pods which sounds really good and he already owes me money so im getting it for free...\u000a\u000a
p292
aVUmm...is this satire? Not trying to be a dick, asking legitimately. If not, then literally just take the Juul along with all your pods, and toss it in the trash. Problem solved. 
p293
aVBuy a juul. I quit 3 weeks ago and haven\u2019t craved a cig since. 
p294
aVJuul. Not sure if you consider this \u201cquitting\u201d or not, but after 7 years of smoking a pack a day I entirely switched within 2 weeks, then cut down from 5% nicotine to 3%, will soon go to 0% then hopefully off it entirely. 
p295
aVStarted vaping again and smoking much less, but still hard to breathe/tightness in lungs\u000a\u000aHey guys.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aI've been smoking for about 4 years now, on and off but mostly on. I smoke about a pack every 4-5 days.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aRecently (as of September) I decided to try the JUUL, and try and smoke much less. It worked really well in terms of actually being my first vape experience where I wasn't craving a cigarette afterwards. I went a few weeks without smoking at all, and it was great.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aMy only issue was that even though I wasn't smoking, it was still hard to breathe, and in fact I would say that it actually got worse. I feel winded going up flights of stairs (only mildly so while I was smoking), and even during regular physical activity I'm just finding myself way more out of breath all the time. Nothing else in my lifestyle has changed (regular weight lifting, eating habits normal, sleep is normal, etc.)\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aHas any one else experienced continued/worsened lung conditions while vaping? \u000a\u000aI'm also trying to figure out if it is the smoke/tar/carbon monoxide in cigarettes that make it hard to breathe, or if it is actually just the nicotine. The JUUL delivers a lot of nicotine compared to other vapes, and I'm wondering if perhaps things like shortage of breath are actually linked to nicotine, and not the smoke itself?\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aLet me know what you guys think. \u000a\u000aA
p296
aVIf your in America the Juul pods contain 50mg of nicotine but in the UK they only contain 20mg.\u000a\u000aSomeone who smokes 20 a day is advised to use 12mg strength liquids. This could explain the tight chest feeling you are getting.\u000a\u000aYou might want to think about may be changing the type of vaporizer you are using so you can reduce the nicotine \U0001f609
p297
aVHow long does it take for you to go through a Juul pod?
p298
aVInteresting! Do you find you still get a significant enough headrush from the nicotine in freebase on 12mg to not miss having cigarettes? I just have never had a vape experience like this before which makes me want to continue using the JUUL, but it's illuminating to learn that I'm not the only one who has experienced this with nic salts.
p299
aVKid, I haven\u2019t had a head rush from nicotine since 1994 when I first started smoking:)\u000a\u000aFor me, the throat hit was important, and 18mg of freebase nic did the job. I liked it much better than salts. The whole concept of salts is to make it smoother, but I didn\u2019t prefer smooth. If you do try 18, just take 3 consecutive puffs to equal one Juul puff. \u000a\u000aGoing from 50 to 35 to 25, then to freebase 18 to 12 wasn\u2019t too hard for me, and I smoked 2+ packs a day. \u000a\u000aI\u2019d hate for you to buy gear and new liquid if that\u2019s not the problem, though. I\u2019d send you a spare refillable pod system I have but I\u2019m not sure if I can get it from Texas through Canadian customs. Lol.
p300
aVI appreciate the thought anyway :)\u000a\u000aI'm going to see if I can get my hands on a Breeze 2 in the meantime, they're not too expensive (cheaper than a Juul) so it's worth a shot at least.\u000a\u000aI was thinking of going back to just smoking but that just doesn't really work out long-term because that gave me the same problems with breathing.\u000a\u000aIn the end, it may actually just be the nicotine causing the issues (I have relatively high blood pressure, I wonder if high blood pressure and shortness of breath have any connection?)\u000a\u000aIf that is the case, I might just have to say goodbye to nicotine. 
p301
aVI BOUGHT A JUUL JUST TO BE A MEME (satire I think juul's are dumb)\u000a\u000a
p302
aVI felt horrible the few times I smoked while walking my doggo. Really hit me in the feels about how bad I was at controlling my cravings. I'm using a juul now, and when I walk her while using it I don't feel as bad.
p303
aVI downgraded to Juul. I still smoked the same amount, and it it still gave me the same kick. In the end though, I wasn't getting carcinogens and smelliness and that was confidence boosting. Is there any support group you have outside of this subreddit?
p304
aVI\u2019m Done.\u000a\u000aNo \u201c1 upvote=1 day I don\u2019t smoke\u201d. No \u201conly quitting for a bit\u201d. No \u201conly smoking when I drink\u201d. I\u2019m done.\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve only been smoking for two years, I\u2019m 21, so I\u2019m not two concerned for my long term health going forward. But I know that if I keep smoking, it\u2019ll be come an issue. Even now I\u2019ve been coughing and have a slight lump in my throat, but I\u2019ve also had cold symptoms so it\u2019s probably that. But I\u2019m a paranoid dude in general, so my mind automatically thinks \u201cthis is cancer, and I\u2019m going to have to have my voice box removed and have a stoma for the rest of my life\u201d.\u000a\u000aNo more of that. I bought a juul today, smoked my last cigarette at about 2:30pm. I\u2019m done.
p305
aVI don't know what a juul is but I can empathize with your paranoia. It's what has helped me quit.
p306
aVI\u2019m approaching my year mark\u000a\u000aI\u2019m 22 and had been smoking since I was 15, I quit for 8 months in 2017 but now I\u2019m rounding on a year tobacco free and it feels real this time. I still use a Juul though, but I feel so much healthier overall. Next to quit is vaping, but it helps so much curbing cravings. One day at a time guys it\u2019s 100% worth it.
p307
aVI was already planning to throw away my Juul tomorrow. I'm down.
p308
aVYes vapes got me to quit cigarettes but you will quickly realize vapes have many drawbacks. You can chain vape anywhere and get blasted with the higher nicotine. I can sit in my room all day sucking down $5-15 worth of juul pods or juice and not have to get up to go outside. I also feel as if juuls with their nicotine salts are MUCH more addicting. I have never fiended for nicotine like this before! It's expensive and more addicting. Work on quitting with other aids or try to use vapes to ween yourself off. Don't fall into the trap of thinking vapes are so much better and spending hundreds of $ on juice and vape upgrades. 
p309
aVMy personal experience is that I was a pack a day smoker and I quit smoking cigarettes 2 months ago and vaped as a replacement (mostly e-cig, sometimes juul) as a transition. I successfully stopped vaping 3 weeks ago. I stopped vaping cold turkey when I realized how easy it was to worsen my addiction - not needing to go outside, not really being able to measure how much I was smoking, etc. It did help me to take the edge off so I could hold down my job and not kill anyone.  And there were probably a handful of times that I would have caved and had a cigarette without it, like hanging out with friends who were smoking while drinking. I think you need to find what works for you and what will ultimately get you 100% off nicotine. We all have our journeys. I personally don't think vaping is any less "valid" than using the patch for example. But I know for me getting off everything as quickly as possible was my ultimate goal.
p310
aVQuitting e-cigs (juul)\u000a\u000aI posted this in r/juul but just found this subreddit. I feel like you guys can help if possible. Thanks so much in advance. I appreciate it genuinely.\u000a\u000a\u000aI hope y\u2019all are doing well. I want to first apologize for this wall of text, but I\u2019m feeling pretty out of it recently and I know some of you could probably help me out as youve experienced this. \u000a\u000a\u000aThe first time I ripped a juul was the first day of my freshman year of college, nearly 2 and a half years ago. I thought it was weed and within seconds I was coughing my dick off. I\u2019d never used nicotine besides dipping very rarely at home with my boys at a bonfire and never particularly loved it, it just made me sick. One thing led to another, just like I\u2019m sure most of your juul stories could corroborate, and I was ripping my friends juuls until I eventually caved in and got my own. Naturally, my usage went up, and by the end of my freshman year and especially during pledging my fraternity, I was a pod a day. \u000a\u000aDue to some personal things, my sophomore year I got super depressed and my anxiety went through the roof. I used the juul to cope. It was there when I needed it. The money wasn\u2019t really an issue, I worked and pods were just part of my expenses. Now it\u2019s a year later and I can\u2019t even wake up and be a functioning human without nicotine. I can\u2019t concentrate on school when I don\u2019t have nicotine. My anxiety is at an all time high when I don\u2019t have nicotine. And that shit just scares the hell out of me. \u000a\u000aI\u2019ve gone 24 hours before without it but I literally feel like death. I shake, sweat, even have thrown up, just because I don\u2019t have it. Is there a way to quit that can alleviate some of these symptoms? I feel like cold turkey is the only option though, but I just don\u2019t know.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a\u000aTL;DR: got addicted to juul like everyone else. Used to it to cope with pledgeship, anxiety, stress, and depression. 2.5 years later if I try to quit I can\u2019t function as a human. I need advice/help
p311
aVIt seems like a good thing for you is to taper yourself off over a long period of time. Your body is super dependent on nicotine. You can try and get some 3% pods from juul and start there. Then you can start bringing in some non nicotine pods to help ween yourself off slowly. There are some non nicotine pods at [cyclonepods.com](https://cyclonepods.com). Good luck and hang in there
p312
aVNope, I replaced it with a juul and now I\u2019m addicted to that. Try candy. 
p313
aVCan you use placebos (0% nic vapes) to quit?\u000a\u000aHey all, at the ripe old age of 19 I've decided to quit smoking. I started using it as a way to cope with my dad's death and I can already feel the nicotine urges growing, so I don't want to open a whole new bag of worms with this. If my level of addiction is low (only get urges when hungry or insanely bored), can I use a placebo vapor pen to cope? Maybe the feeling of filling my lungs with something (yuck, I know) will help? I bought a juul today thinking it would be a healthier alternative, but I felt like it was a stupid decision and returned it. Has anyone tried it and saw some kind of result, good or bad?
p314
aVThanks for the reply! I bought a cheapo 0% with the juul return money, hopefully it works.
p315
aVIf you liked the juul there are some non nicotine pods at [cyclonepods.com](https://cyclonepods.com) that you could check out. hope that can help buddy

aVLooking to quit\u000a\u000aI'm about a week from my 29th birthday and as a present for myself I want to quit cigarettes to give myself a healthier life. I've "quit" before a few times and only lasted from one day to three max before either buying a pack or just getting a black and mild for a quick fix that turned right into buying another pack hours later.\u000a\u000aA friend of mine that's a bartender mentioned some of her regulars have used the Juul for a month or two and now don't even use the Juul or smoke at all.\u000a\u000aAbout 3 years ago I had a cheap vaporizer but only lasted 3 or 4 weeks before I went back to cigarettes, granted at the time I was working night shifts at a restaurant and was constantly around other smokers so I fell back in quickly. Currently no one else I work with smokes, my girlfriend doesn't smoke, and I don't go to bars nearly as much, maybe 1-2 times a month so I don't have a "reason" to socially smoke like I used to. Even though I still light up on breaks and after work. In the past 2 years I've been around non smokers it's always some stressor that makes me go back to smoking when I've tried to quit so I guess I don't have the self discipline to just go cold turkey.\u000a\u000aI don't want to be a dick from nicotine withdrawals because I'm already tired of others suffering from my addiction, from the smell to 2nd hand smoke. What has helped y'all with quitting? Get a Juul to cut down or just buckle down and quit then apologize for being an ass after the withdrawals are over?
p317
aVA WORKING smoking ALTERNATIVE if you can't QUIT.\u000a\u000aHi everyone, I've been around many smokers in my life and most didn't have the will power to quit completely. This will ultimately lead to bad health effects in the future for them. Everyone knows it's better to not inhale anything, than to. The problem with smoking is not only that your burning tobacco, but the ingredients that your burning creates further problems. Your will start to cough up black tar, and it will get hard to breathe. \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aSO what's the ALTERNATIVE to QUIT?!\u000a\u000aMany smokers don't take this method seriously, and pass it off as just as harmful. Despite most doctors agreeing it is at least 95%-99% healthier than smoking. Once smokers have switched to "this method" they have seen that they are no longer coughing up black tar, breathing has become easier, and overall they can expect to now live longer. \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aThe alternative to quit smoking, is VAPING. There have been many test done, recently some on YouTube showing one month of smoking vs one month of vaping. Let's just say that one cigarette turned out to leave worse results than a whole month of vaping. In this test, they used cotton balls to act as the lungs. Then they used air pressure to suck in either the vapor or smoke, and it would be blow out another tube on the opposite side. With smoking, black tar was left everywhere.. but with vaping the cotton was clear white with a little moisture on it. A fun fact, scientist say you inhale more water vapor when showering then you do when vaping. So, does this confirm the 99% safer claim? Well, not completely but we can definitely see that is is much safer.. we just cant 100% estimate how safe it is exactly.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aWHY is it SO HARD to QUIT?!\u000a\u000aWell, first off you're most likely addicted to nicotine. Now you ask "doesn't vaping contain nicotine?"\u000a\u000aYes, but no. You can get it with nicotine, and you can also get it without it. Many people think nicotine is the harmful part in cigarettes, when in reality most scientist say it's just as harmful as caffeine. Switching to vaping will provide you with the same experience as smoking, just with more flavor options, and less health effects. \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aMy WHOLE POINT in this LONG essay?\u000a\u000aIf your addicted to nicotine and you don't want to quit it, why smoke cigarettes when there is a healthier and more enjoyable nicotine alternative out there? There are small vape devices that resemble a cigarette such as the JUUL, you can also look into the Suorin Air. I would suggest getting a high nicotine e-liquid when you're first quitting.

aV3 months in and I convinced myself to it was ok to relapse. Full of regret\u000a\u000aIt started as a puff of someone else's Juul at a party and turned into a constant nagging, tugging voice in the back of my head. My junkie brain gave every reason under the sun why I should start vaping again. 'I really miss it' 'I won't do it as much as I used to' 'Im not really ready to quit!' 'It was easy the last time, I can quit again no problem'\u000a\u000aGoing to the store for new pods I was almost giddy with excitement. I popped one in my Juul as soon as I was out of the store and inhaled. I felt...immediate regret, sadness, guilt. It didn't feel as amazing as I thought it would. I can't believe I let myself talk myself back into this! \u000a\u000aLike I completely forgot the asthma attack that was my wake-up call to quit, or how I gained 10lbs to do so, or that my insides we're messed up for two weeks due to nicotine withdrawal but I made it through anyway. For what? I just threw those sacrifices away. I thought it would be a relief to start again but it's just the opposite. \u000a\u000aDon't be like me. Stay strong. Start committed.

aVI smoked for 11 years then Vaped for 30 days and as of today I am 99 days nicotine free. It was harder to drop the vape than cigs but you can do it.\u000a\u000aTBH vaping the juul gave me bad anxiety at times. Set a quit date and stick to it. I still carried a vape in car and backpack but I kept it out of sight and just kept them around for a few days, kind of like a safety net was my thinking..
p322
aVWell if you use a NRD the juul believe it or not is great and you can go to a vape shop get some juice and refill the pods like 2/3 times each I'm 32 smoked Newport 100 for 15 yrs I quit using a vape. It works 
p323
aVYour body is already nicotine free at this point, so using any kind of nicotine now would be a big step backwards.  Juul in particular seems to make people more addicted to nicotine than they were smoking cigarettes. Sounds like you're doing great cold turkey.\u000a\u000aIf you haven't discovered Joel Spitzer videos yet, you might want to check him out. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCag4hg_fX_NnOb1N4yXA97Q . The guy really understands everything about quitting. He helped me a lot. 
p324
aVI\u2019m really struggling\u000a\u000aSo I switched from cigarettes to a Juul a couple months ago. It\u2019s been great for a nicotine fix. I lost my Juul on Saturday and decided I wanted to just not buy another. It\u2019s now Monday morning, I\u2019m only an hour into my eight hour shift and I\u2019m already feeling like I\u2019m going to explode. I have the capability of getting away and buying another or bumming a cigarette and could do it easily. How can I convince myself not to?
p325
aVFirst things first: WTF is a juul? Never mind. I'll just assume it's a variant of a vaporizer. BTW those are becoming an epidemic among teens. This is your first clue how great these so called alternatives will help in any capacity. Stop listening to the legalized drug pushers. Anyone staying otherwise is full of bunk. I've smoked for 25 years , and am coming up on my 5th year without that crap. \u000a\u000aI've done my research and did it cold turkey. Before making new excuses of why you can't do the same, hear yourself making them excuses. That's the little fuck you want to destroy. Right there in front of you. Blocking the exit. Its called ADDICTION. \u000a\u000aI'm not saying it's going to be easy to quit cold turkey. It, in fact, was comparable ( for myself ) to drowning in a pool, while letting it happen. But there are many things you can do that helps dramatically. Do your research and start learning. A lifestyle change is very helpful and possibly beneficial depending on your choice. Personally, it was taking up running.\u000a\u000aI'll not teach you everything though. There's a book, no matter how annoying it is to read that will help the most, But only if you soak in its knowledge. "Carr's easyway to quit smoking" read that thing multiple times til you "get it". Then drop the cigarettes/vapes/Chanix (trainrekts\U0001f605)/patches.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p326
aVRemind yourself that you will not feel better if you smoke a cigarette or puff on a a Juul. Because you've made it long enough without putting nicotine in your body that it actually, truly WILL make you feel bad if you do it.
p327
aVDay 3. Patch, gum, and Juul. Am I doing this wrong?\u000a\u000aPart of me feels like using so many different nicotine products is actually just swapping addiction. The other part of me is telling me that even addition to any of these is better than smoking.\u000a\u000aBeen smoking almost 10 years (25yo), the worst part is kind of that I'm wondering what I'm going to do with myself during these little gaps of activity. What will I find to do that I look forward to as much as I did smoking a cigarette. Lotta emotions about this but I feel ready to quit.
p328
aVIf you're using patches, gum, and a Juul, you are probably overdosing on nicotine. The Juul by itself has as much nicotine as a cigarette does. You need to trim that back... a lot. Get rid of the Juul or you're going to regret it. If you don't believe me, scroll back through some of the posts on here and look for mentions of Juul. Those things are worse than cigarettes from an addiction level.
p329
aVI haven't used the Juul a ton, mostly a reusable Blu e-cig, but I'm sure the point still stands
p330
aVCongrats Man I\u2019m currently on day 15 cold turkey no patches, medication, gum, vape, or juul. I have noticed I have more energy but also yes I have had an increase in stress 
p331
aVQuit smoking cigarettes and got hives\u000a\u000aI was smoking about a pack every 3 days. Exactly one week ago I quit smoking cigarettes and bought a Juul (vape) I was fine for the first 4 days, but the last few days I\u2019ve had hives. I stopped smoking the vape and the hives slowly went away. Anyone experience hives when quitting/changing nicotine levels? I know I\u2019m not allergic to the vape ( propylene glycol) because I didn\u2019t get a reaction for a few days, if I was allergic it would have showed up faster. 
p332
aVThanks for your reply. \u000a\u000aI'm using the JUUL starter-kit. I'm also trying to quit other bad habits at the same time so its probably a combination of that. I feel much better today. :)
p333
aVEvery time I see an article titled \u201cteenage juul use may cause them to shut down\u201d I die a little inside.\u000a\u000aI have smoked cigarettes (2-5 packs a week) since I was 13. I am currently 23 and I have tried everything you can buy to quit smoking, since I was 18. My juul is the only thing that has helped me. I have used multiple \u201cvapes\u201d but the pure convenience has been the thing that helped my stay on track. I understand that teenage use isn\u2019t legal and not really ideal. But the fact that most of my friends and everyone that I went to high school with smoked at some point. It\u2019s \u201ccool\u201d, I get it. But please don\u2019t ruin this for me. 1 month strong, I need to stock up before the youth ruin everything.
p334
aVWhat's your plan for getting off the Juul?
p335
aVGood. Stick with your plan and don't stay on 3% very long. You may take fewer puffs off a Juul per day than you did with cigarettes, but Juul delivers a lot of nicotine. 
p336
aVI just stopped this weekend. Woke up barely able to breath (unrelated to cigarettes) but it made me realize how dumb it is to smoke.\u000a\u000aIt's been 100 hours since I've had a cigarette and NEVER thought I could ever made it this far without one. Granted I'm using a Juul to help with the cravings, still I'm proud. Planning on buying lower and lower nic juice for the juul and getting to the point where I no longer need nicotine. \u000a\u000aI highly recommend a Juul honestly. It's still nicotine but getting rid of the cigarettes first, helped/helps me. I see cigarettes now and I'm repulsed. My fingers no longer stink and all in all I feel proud of myself. 10 year addiction and I'm slowly getting off of it.\u000a\u000aYou can do it OP. But you have to want it. I want to live. You should too.\u000a\u000a
p337
aV999 days...\u000a\u000aI just walked into the 7-11 next to my house and one of the cashiers that I'm friendly with was restocking cigarette vape cartridges.  Juul I think they're called.  I made a comment about how I don't know anything about that stuff anymore and every time I come in there I see the tobacco and I'm glad I don't care about it.  Then I realized I was close to 1,000 days since my last cigarette and checked my app. 999 days.  Good enough and I prefer the number aesthetically anyways. \u000a\u000aI never thought I'd be here but I am.  I quit about 100 times before it finally happened and I got really good at it.  Finally on like Christmas eve 2015 I was hadn't smoked for like a week and we were at my wife's sisters house and she went out to smoke and I got stressed and decided to go have one with her.  My wife yelled at me, told me to let it go, and that was finally the last time I was genuinely tempted to smoke.  I haven't had the desire to smoke in at least two years and I never ever even think about it anymore.  If you genuinely want to quit you can and it gets easier until you stop caring.  I was a 1.5-2 pack a day smoker (and if I drank it was more) for about 14 years.  \u000a\u000aOne thing that helped me out is an exercise regimen. I ride bikes daily and run occasionally.  I love riding road and cyclocross bikes very fast and up mountains besides just going to the store or restaurants on them.  Smoking was fucking it up so stopping was beneficial to my passion.  I'm not saying you have to ride bikes but if you're passionate about any cardio related activity you'll want to not smoke.\u000a\u000aAnyway, I'm very grateful to be here and thought I'd share.  Good luck to anybody who is struggling.  Take it one day at a time.  If you quit for a week, two weeks, a month, or more and then relapse do not give up.  Every time you quit you get better at it.  YOU CAN DO IT.
p338
aVHas anyone tried quitting caffeine before quitting smoking?\u000a\u000aI'm a daily vaper. I vape everywhere and anywhere that I can. Nonstop. I do smoke cigarettes occasionally, but they don't do much for me now that I use the Juul. I'm also a caffeine junkie. I have extreme (diagnosed) anxiety and it seems to be intensified by both, especially at the same time.\u000a\u000aAwhile back a friend told me that she had great success quitting caffeine before quitting smoking. She didn't go into specifics, but when she said that I realized it was true that every time I drank caffeine I wanted more nicotine. Caffeine definitely triggers my nicotine use and vis versa. Although nicotine is definitely more important to quit, I thought that I might have more success with quitting caffeine first or even at the same time. I was wondering if anyone has tried this or even quitting both at the same time. Did it help?

aVVaping helped me quit smoking. Help me quit vaping!\u000a\u000aI cross-posted this to the electronic cigarette subreddit. I hope that isn't against the rules. I'm just hoping to get a different perspective by posting it here, too.\u000a\u000atldr: I'm quitting Juul and I'm looking for advice and/or success stories.\u000a\u000aI am going to quit my Juul this week.\u000a\u000aI started vaping back in 2012. I smoked cigarettes for years before that, mostly in college, and vaping was just a better alternative. However, it just didn't quite "hit the spot" like cigarettes did. I used everything from cig-a-likes to tanks to rebuildable coils. Circa 2017, I was introduced to the Juul. Now this device, it was exactly what I was looking for. I can honestly say that, since I started Juuling, I have never had a craving for a cigarette.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, rather than being addicted to cigarettes, I'm now addicted to my Juul. Is it safer than smoking? I think so, but there haven't been any studies on the long-term effects of vaping. I'm not a scientist, but common sense tells me that heating up any sort of chemical and inhaling it into your lungs, even ones that are safe for swallowing and consumption, isn't good for your body. Sure, it's not as harmful as cigarettes, but that doesn't mean it isn't harmful at all. I'm not trying to convince anyone that vaping is bad for you, I just know that I don't want to do it to my body anymore. I go through about one Juul pod each day. Sometimes, I go through more. Sometimes, I go through less; it really just depends on what I'm doing that day and what I have on my mind. Each pod is about $5, which means I have spent about $1,800 on Juul pods since 2017. I'm comfortable financially, so the money isn't really the biggest issue for me, but that is a good chunk of change to be spending on something that you don't need.\u000a\u000aThe Juul has become a part of my life. I literally never leave the house without it; I depend on it. That is not good for my psychologically. Combine this with the health and monetary aspects, and I know that I will have to stop eventually. I don't want to be dependent on a Juul when I'm 60 years old. \u000a\u000aI have tried to stop before. My Juul stopped working several months ago, and I decided that I was just not going to buy another one. That lasted about 2 weeks, and I had a stressful week and broke. I went and bought another one, and I haven't even considered quitting again until now.\u000a\u000aI'm writing this for three main reasons. The first is to actually get it down in writing so that I can hold myself accountable. If I want to start Juuling again, I can just say, "Hey, you already said that you were going to quit. You want to be a liar? You want to back out of your word?" I don't want to do either of those things, so a written promise to myself will help me a lot.\u000a\u000aThe second reason is to crowdsource. I am hoping that there are other people that have successfully quit that can share both their success and their failures. What was easy? What was hard? How do you feel about it now? Additionally, I'm hoping to get advice on what approach to take.\u000a\u000aMy initial plan was to buy a very boxy, inconvenient box mod and use 0-3mg juice for a while to gently get my body out of the groove. The thing about the Juul is that it is so convenient and stealthy. I can vape literally anywhere and no one will know. I thought that, by having a more conspicuous "cloud chucker" and a larger, less-convenient mod, I would vape less. For me, driving is one of my biggest triggers. I really hate driving, but I drive about 500 miles each week. Vaping has always made driving more tolerable. Perhaps I could just keep a box mod for my car and vape while I drive. I have reservations about this approach, however. Do I want to be tooting massive clouds when I'm 60 years old? I don't think so. My original goal with vaping was to quit smoking cigarettes. I succeeded. Now, I have to quit vaping. Replacing one vape with another, albeit an incremental step, doesn't feel like accomplishing too much.\u000a\u000aAlternatively, I just stop buying the pods, don't buy another device, and let it go. Maybe I'll buy a fidget cube or something. This is a daunting concept for me mentally. It sounds ridiculous, but I can't imagine my life without Juul at this point. The fact that I feel that way is one of the major reasons that I want to quit. I feel that this would be the most beneficial approach, but I think that it also has the greatest potential for relapse. Obviously, it all comes down to willpower, but if I had the strongest willpower on earth, I would have never started smoking in the first place. I have already proven that just "deciding" to stop didn't work out too well for me. I have a pretty stressful job, and sometimes hitting that Juul is what really helps me get through the day. Isn't that sad? I have convinced myself that a stick that heats up chemicals that I suck into my lung is what I need to get through the day and/or to make the day more enjoyable.\u000a\u000aA third option is to continue buying Juul pods and rationing them to myself. Limiting myself to one pack per week at first ( I usually go through about 1 and 1/2 to 2 packs per week), and slowly going down and down until a pod lasts me a week. I think that quitting would be relatively easy at that point.\u000a\u000aWhat do you think I should do? Please, if you're struggling to quit Juul or if you have a quitting success story, share it in the comments.
p340
aVMake a planned quit date. Tell people about the planned quit date.\u000a\u000aOn the quit date: Enjoy the last vape, it's the last one you will ever have(take a picture so you can see the timedate stamp of your very last vape and so you can show your future kids how dumb you once looked with a metal battery in your mouth.).\u000a\u000aDays 1 - 2 or 3: Bring the juul with you for one to two days, or three if the struggle is real. This is just so you feel like you have a safety net if you need one, you won't though! You got this! P.S. try to avoid touching ecig stuff as just a little juice on the fingertip will heighten nicotine levels which will only prolong the pain before the great sensation of fresh tasting food. Seriously, food will taste so dang good after a like a week, your taste buds are gonna love you!\u000a\u000aDay 4 - 5 or 6: Hide the juul in the cupboard, center console, places you wont see them.\u000a\u000aDay 7 or as soon as you are ready: Sell it all! Be free, sing to yourself, "I want to break free!" -Queen --&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUOtCLOXgm8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUOtCLOXgm8)\u000a\u000aDay 8: Feel free, leave the house without thinking about if you have E-juice, batteries, ecig or if the battery is charged.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aNOTE: This is pretty much what I did after 11 years smoking and 1 month juuling.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aP.S. - Whatcha gonna do with all the money you saved?
p341
aVI vaped for a few months before I quit and ended up being very addicted to nicotine\u000aI actually spent more time vaping than I did smoking. I used the Juno, which is similar to the Juul, and felt as enslaved to that as I did cigarettes.\u000a\u000aMy approach was throwing away the Juno and the  pods. I knew it was probably going to be as intense as quitting smoking but that each craving would only last a certain amount of time. By the time I drove to the vape shop the craving would be over. \u000a\u000aIt's worked so far! \u000a\u000aGood luck'
p342
aVWow... this could almost be my post, word for word.  I'm in pretty much the exact situation.  I feel great for not having touched a cigarette for months and it's great that I'm not inhaling burning tobacco, but I'm spending as much (if not more) on juul pods.\u000a\u000aI'm also finding myself doing the same stupid things when I run out as I was when I used to smoke (late night runs to the 7/11 to buy more, even in shit weather), with the downside of being able to vape far more than I smoked (indoors, the bathroom, my office, etc).\u000a\u000aI'm trying to figure out how I'm going to do this myself.  So far I'm thinking nic patches are the trick, but haven't committed to the plan yet.  Cold turkey is probably the best bet.  At least the upside is that in the meantime we know that vaping is not nearly as dangerous as cigarette smoke.  [shrug]
p343
aVI'm 2 weeks smoke free (cold turkey) and never heard about Juul until now. Damn it now I keep thinking about juuling.
p344
aV \u000a\u000a&gt;For me, driving is one of my biggest triggers. I really hate driving, but I drive about 500 miles each week. Vaping has always made driving more tolerable. ... Perhaps I could just keep a box mod for my car and vape while I drive. \u000a\u000a\u005c--&gt; Nice to hear that someone besides me hate to drive cars :-) It is one of my biggest triggers, too.  So for this situation, I would agree to have a e-cigarette with very low nicotine as you said max 3 mg; also use very low contens of  flavouring substances (a third of recommend or your personal regular dose). And please never take your only-for-car-e-cigarette out of the car, never ever!\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a&gt;Isn't that sad? I have convinced myself that a stick that heats up chemicals that I suck into my lungs is what I need to get through the day and/or to make the day more enjoyable. \u000a\u000a\u005c--&gt; That is only because you are an addict. You need this just to feel normal like non addicts. "More enjoyable" for an addict just means addiction without facing/ having withdrawals at this moment. The only way to get out of this is to be an totally non-nicotine consumer for a long time (at least months in my opinion, but it will get better after \u005c~2weeks from day to day with some hard-to-take downs and even some nice ups)\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000a&gt; A third option is to continue buying Juul pods and rationing them to myself. Limiting myself to one pack per week at first ( I usually go through about 1 and 1/2 to 2 packs per week), and slowly going down and down until a pod lasts me a week. I think that quitting would be relatively easy at that point. \u000a\u000a\u005c--&gt; For some (in my opinion few) people this could be an option. But you sound like you are very nicotine-addicted. Your addicted brain will have some options like an unconsciously depper inhaling to get more nicotine out of one toke. And your nicotine-brain will trick you that it doesn't have to face nicotine-withdrawals. The same is if you lower the nicotine-content (esp. in smaller steps)\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aSo maybe except of the car situation (only in the first weeks) I would suggest you use an e-cigarette completely without nicotine (cold turkey). If the withdrawals are too hard then use half/1third of the nicotine you were used to for a week or two. And then lower the dose to 0. Also, lower flavouring substances drastically.\u000a\u000aThat helped me alot. Esp. in the first weeks i sucked all the time. But eventually my brain learned that there is absolute nothing rewarding about sucking a vape that doesn't taste very good (due to maximim lowered flavours) and does not contain a (very very hard but legal) drug.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;

aVDay 12 - going strong\u000a\u000aMy energy has increased, in turn my productivity. I have bipolar disorder so I have some fears of mania, but so far my friends and loved ones have enjoyed the new energetic me. I started working out again using the Nike+ Training app, and all the workouts are way easier! I've even set a new personal record. Running feels AMAZING.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aWhen I have cravings, which is largely when I have downtime, am driving, or in a social setting, I hit the Juul. Gone thru a few pods already, I like the Mango best. I'm conscious of my use tho, bc I actually want to SAVE money. Got rid of the Chantix, this was my second time taking it, the first time I didn't last two days bc of the weight gain. (Yes I know I am vain.) \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aI'm feeling confident, but not cocky! Looking forward to day 365.

aVDay 3 without Nic\u000a\u000aI'm on day three of no nicotine. I've been smoking and vaping almost daily since February. Today might be rough- days 1 and 2 I spent at home but I'm at work all day today. Work has been one of my biggest smoking/vaping triggers. Having a JUUL made discreetly vaping at work way too easy. All I had to do was dip into a corner where the cameras couldn't see me. No smell, didn't even have to go outside.\u000a\u000aI didn't bring anything to work with me. No cigs in my bag or car, the JUUL is at home, and I can't leave to go buy anything. So I won't be tempted, but I feel pretty irritable. Trying to breathe through it. 
p347
aVI haven't used it but my roommate is a hardcore, 1 pack a day minimum, smoker and he switched to Juul and swears by it.
p348
aVI just want to vent, I recently gave up my juul. Long after cigarettes and it just sucks right now.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s been a week for me, I\u2019m really fucking pissed of fat the world. My SO is supporting me and my friends are behind me as well. Thing is, is that I gave up smokes and went to vaping, then to juuls. I gave up my juul to my friend who doesn\u2019t vape as often and it\u2019s just really irritating and frustrating to be around them bc they won\u2019t let me get a puff. I hate everything. I can\u2019t sleep right, I can\u2019t wake up right, I can\u2019t stay up during classes, I can\u2019t even shit like i used to. \u000a\u000aI feel like I should get a puff, because it was formerly my juul? We pass it around all the time when drinking or before I tried quitting. I understand that they want the best for me but I am just so frustrated with everything. I started getting multiple dreams a night where it\u2019s just me trying so hard to get to hit a juul, splitting wires to force a connection, stealing them from the store, and just having one and hitting it. From habit I still look around for it in my pockets, hoping that it would magically appear. Hearing it being puffed from is enough to make me irritated. I can see I\u2019m not the same person as I was when I was using a juul, but it really does feel like hell. \u000a\u000aI really want to go and buy a pack of smokes, Ive started over so many times, Cigarettes to juul and quit then back to cigarettes. I\u2019ve tried. I\u2019m really upset but I made a promise to my SO to not smoke a cigarette. I know it sounds silly about this juul and the extent of my withdrawals. But this has been hell for me. 
p349
aVTell yourself this is temporary and going back would just prolong the pain.\u000a\u000aNicotine in all forms can be a serious addiction so don't underplay juul, smoking, or any other delivery.
p350
aVMaybe talk to someone who will hold you accountable and set up a plan to wean off the juul rather than just quitting all at once. I don\u2019t know for certain if that\u2019d help or make things worse, but cold turkey withdraws from a juul are pretty gut wrenching and difficult in my experience. I also use one and am a former smoker but I\u2019m talking with my therapist about quitting. 
p351
aVGet some gum. Cinnamon or something with a strong flavor. Whenever you get the urge, put in a piece of gum. Chew the hell out of it. Take your frustration out on the gum. The urge will pass. \u000a\u000aEventually you mind will associate the urge with the gum... which tastes a million times better and is a lot better for you. \u000a\u000aYou replaced smokes with vape. Replaced vape with the juul... which is still vape, so now you need to replace the vape with something else. Your brain will make the switch. \u000a\u000aI smoked for almost 15 years. Vaped for another 7 or so. This works. 
p352
aVWas your last nicotine in MAy (in any form including patch, juul, gum, patch)?\u000a\u000aWould you consider yourself a regualr to heavy coffee drinker? \u000a\u000aDid you use any meds to help you quit?  Wellbutrin or chantix? 
p353
aV4 days in and I don't want to go back... Help me Plz :'(\u000a\u000aThis is my second attempt quitting and it hasn't gotten much easier if at all since the first try :'( I need to quit since I train in Muay Thai everyday and hope to compete by next year, also nicotine is just horrible for my mental health and makes me feel horrible everyday. The hardest part is not letting your brain trick you :'( when I start telling myself that "it's okay to just have one" and I look for reasons to justify having one is when it gets rough, and when people say the cravings "Never go away, it's always a battle for the rest of your life" is when it gets REALLY ROUGH because then it makes me feel like this is not even worth it :'( so do you guys feel it's a bad idea to even have one? Does it lengthen the duration of these withdrawal symptoms?? (As I type this I know I'm subconciously hoping that you guys say it's okay to have one so I can run to my coworker and grab one, but I really hope you guys say it's a horrible idea so I can smack myself into shape) And do you guys feel it's true that the battle never ends, or is it much easier to deal with in the future? I have only been smoking for maybe 4 years??? And a pack every 3-4 days. I smoked a Juul for the last year. Thank you guys so much for any help through this!! :'(
p354
aVAdvice for more addicted smokers\u000a\u000aNot to be dramatic but I wanna hear some advice from smokers who started young. Idk if any of you know where albania is but cigarettes is embedded in our culture. I started at a quarter pack at 14 and reached a full pack at 16. I am now smoking a juul pod a day instead of cigarettes but I cannot go without some form of nicotine. I know if I keep going it\u2019s going to get much worse. Patches or gum? Anyone tried naltrexone? I am 20 years old. I know it seems young but my addiction is heavy. 
p355
aVI'll chime in with a patch endorsement. I tried the gum in the past and didn't like the taste very much, not to mention you have to chew it a *certain way.* I use the patch, and I  also  chew regular gum when I have certain kinds of cravings (e.g. after lunch).\u000a\u000aGood on you for thinking about doing this now. The longer you wait the more experiences you'll have with the cigarette (or juul) as your "companion". It's only recently that I've started thinking about all the life shit (good and bad) I went through while smoking. It didn't make it impossible to stop; just a bit harder because those associations get stronger and stronger. So doing it now you're saving yourself a bigger pain in the ass down the line.
p356
aVI just wanted to say you can't smoke a Juul, unless you -really- do it wrong. The Juul could be a very useful step to quitting nicotine, good luck!
p357
aVWhaaaat you\u2019re tweaking if anything the juul made nicotine more accessible to me 
p358
aVJuul is extremely high nicotine so it actually strengthens the nicotine addiction.
p359
aVIf you're having a hard time quitting completely, there is always the option of getting an e-cig or vape. These are no doubt much healthier and the cost is definitely lower. Nicotine isn't the harmful part of ciggs, it's the chemicals. This is just an option if you're finding it impossible to quit, if you can quit completely then awesome! If not, I would recommend checking out products such as the JUUL or Suorin Air. Search "VapeGodShop" on google and you can browse what we have to offer. Use code "reddit10" at checkout for 10% off. Quit smoking, it's the best thing you can do to live longer and happier. 
p360
aVAnyone else never smoked a ciggerrete? (Quitting juul)\u000a\u000aHow's it going guys. I recently quit nicotine and it was one of the hardest things I've ever done. It's been two weeks but the cravings are still with me. They are gradually getting easier. I'm fairly unique in that I've litterally never smoked a ciggerrete. My addiction began with people vaping in the bathrooms during my last year of high school. It quickly became a fun thing to do at school when I was board. When I turned 18 I bought my own juul. And from that point onward up until I quit I was sucking on that thing every second of every day. And multiple times through the night. I had nicotine in my system habitually. There was no break whatsoever. I was going through a pack to two packs of pods a day. I tried to quit a few times. But failed because I kept the juul. Then I threw it out and went camping alone until I got past the 3 day hump. I'm now very happy to be living my life off that addiction train. Although frustrated to still have cravings. But they are manageable so I'll just have to deal with the consequences of my previous actions I guess.\u000a\u000aBut I'm just curious if there are anyone else on here who started on, and only every used vapes? We're the first of a new generation exploited by the addiction industry haha. I would never and will never touch a ciggerrete. But juul seduced me and got me completely addicted. And now that I've quit my friends still all have them and refuse to not hit them around me. Which is making me avoid most of my friends. Its shitty man.
p361
aVSmoke Free app sent me here: can\u2019t stop crying\u000a\u000aSmoked on and off for 12 years. The last five years or so, I was smoking on average half a pack a day, more on party weekends. I\u2019m on day 5 of cold turkey with Chantix - although I skipped yesterday\u2019s dose.\u000a\u000aI figured I could take advantage of the holiday weekend and ride out the withdrawal by staying in bed. I\u2019m dead broke so it\u2019s not like I can go out and buy cigarettes. I ordered a Juul but it doesn\u2019t arrive till tomorrow.\u000a\u000aThe Smoke Free app told me to read at least 10 threads. I made it through four or five before I had to put my phone down. Is it the nicotine that makes me want to mourn smoking? I LOVED smoking, and I was nowhere near the amount some of you were at. I know why I should/will quit, but I feel really shitty about it, like I\u2019m letting a fundamental coping mechanism go. When I was in the mental hospital a couple years back, everybody smoked, it\u2019s what got us through - and when we got transferred to a non smoking facility those damn patches made us all worse.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m rambling. Sorry. But I really miss cigarettes. 
p362
aVSeveral missteps here! People do not copy this quit! \u000a\u000aThe WORST thing you could have done was interrupt your chant-ix to go cold turkey to go to Juul.  It don;t work like that! Each one is going to negate the other. \u000a\u000aYou just wasted a lot of days, a lot of medicine, a lot of Juul, a lot of cold turkey. \u000a
p363
aVIt is wrong and hes a complete douche canoe. Dont listen to this gatekeeping prick. There is nothing wrong with your quit. 5 days is awesome. You do you. You can do this. If you need the juul to help the transition then use the juul. Just remember you are just trading one delivery method for another. But the juul is far and away a safer alternative. Just dont ever pick up a cigarette again. Thats half the battle. Putting down the vape can come when youre ready. One step at a time! :)
p364
aVHi guys! Thanks again for all the support. I am now seven days, that's a WHOLE WEEK, with no cigarettes. I started the Juul on Tuesday, I have to admit I ran home so I could get it from the mailbox on my way to my second job. But now that I have it I don't see myself smoking cigs again! I even reused a very beautiful tin a friend made years ago as my carrying case, and it's wayyyy nicer than any cardboard pack. \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aThis morning, I ran about a mile and a half. I haven't gone running in months, and it was wonderfully not painful! I actually enjoy working out! Thanks again for handling the "gatekeepers," I'm looking forward to getting my 900+ days!
p365
aVShit. I\u2019ve been juuling forever. Been a long time since cigs but not I\u2019m scared to set down the juul 
p366
aVoha, searched the inet, because i didn't know anything about Juul. But what the hell: 59 mg of nicotine??!?! halleluja thats like heroin-fentanyl. how can anything like that be legal?? if someone wants to get nicotine addicted, i would suggest to start with juul, within a few weeks you are so used to nicotine you can soon start to smoke 10 packs of cigarettes/ day.\u000a\u000ai wish you good luck with your setting down. do it slowly, i would suggest to buy an e-cigarette where you can easily lower the nicotine content from time to time. if you do cold turkey, i am sure it would be similar to an opioid withdrawal (never had by my own, only friends tbh). give you enough time and it would be cool if you post sth. on reddit to share your experience and progression 
p367
aVGI issues after quitting Juul\u000a\u000aHey everyone,\u000a\u000aI threw my Juul in the trash this past Friday night after using it for about a year and a half. The cravings are there I guess but what's really bothering is all the stomach issues it's seemed to cause me. Warning for the upcoming tmi but basically I've had diarrhea every morning and thrown up every large meal I've tried to eat. Obviously I'm watching my hydration and my doctor has ordered a few lab tests in the meantime. \u000a\u000aHas anyone else experienced these kinds of side effects from nicotine withdrawal? I'm just a little concerned because I'm now 5 days clean of it and still feel sick. \u000a\u000aAnyway, any input would be comforting.
p368
aVDay 2 smoke free and...\u000a\u000aHonestly it hasn't been that bad. I have been smoking for about 5 years and my latest addiction has been those goddamn juuls. I was extremely worried because in case you didn't know, they are much more addictive and have way more nicotine than a pack of smokes. Knowing this I was afraid that quitting would be the end of me, but after 2 days, it really hasn't been that bad at all. Outside of thinking about smoking in my classes throughout the day as long as I keep busy I don't miss it too much. So far so good, just gotta keep to it. Easier said than done...
p369
aVFirst week without cigarettes after 5 years of smoking\u000a\u000aI started smoking at age 19 when I started working at a bar. Throughout college I lived with all smokers and never was able to quit for this long. Although I am using a Juul pod for nicotine, my lungs feel better already. I honestly can breath through each nostril again, no constant cough, and no constant sinus headache. \u000a\u000aFor everyone who started in college and didn't think it would be a problem to give up after: Quit now. I graduated two years ago and I'm finally now on the right mindset to quit. Don't tack on this extra time. 
p370
aVCongrats man! Anything better than those cancer sticks. I also have a Juul but addicting a substance is not fit my mental set for stopping smokes. How long you think of using Juul?
p371
aVAny tips on how to quit Juuling?\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve been addicted to nicotine for two years now. It started when I was seventeen, going on into my senior year of high school. Now I\u2019m nineteen and in college. It began with cigarettes and then ended with Juuling. I\u2019ve relied on it for the past year now. It\u2019s a huge part of my life - whether or not I want to admit it. It does suck feeling attached to and reliant upon something like this. \u000a\u000aMy father found my Juul this morning and was really disappointed. He took it away from me and is using it for himself now, since he\u2019s also a former smoker. I could always get a new one. I could rip his while it charges downstairs. I could borrow one from a friend. I could do all of these things - BUT I don\u2019t want to! I really want to avoid disappointing him. I really don\u2019t want to be addicted to nicotine like he is FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. I want to quit this shit. It\u2019s been a few hours and the cravings are creeping up on me. \u000a\u000aAny and all tips are welcome!
p372
aVHow many of you guys got Flu-like symptoms after quitting?\u000a\u000aI'm on Day 3 of quitting cigarettes. I've been having a minor throat ache, coughing up mucus, coughing a bit in general, and feeling slightly sluggish. I'm still in-taking nicotine, as I bought a JUUL for myself to help me quit, but haven't touched a single cigarette in 3 days now. \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aI've read that flu-like symptoms are normal after quitting cigarettes, but I'm curious to know how many of ya'll felt flu-like symptoms such as these after quitting. 
p373
aVQuitting Juul\u000a\u000aI'm probably going to have this post taken down on account of my age(16) but why not. I've been using a juul or any vape that has 50% nic since I was 14. I hate that I'm poisoning my body and that I'm a really trashy walking stereotype of a young nicotine addict. I can't imagine life without nicotine, I vape out of habit and when I get a craving. Those usually come every 3 hours and they hit hard. I really want to quit but I don't know what I would do with myself, so much of vaping is social and it would be weird because all my friends do it and I'm constantly surrounded by it. Any help is appreciated  
p374
aVNew smoke free user here as well! 250 hours smoke free!\u000a\u000aCouldn\u2019t have done it without my new best friend, the juul. Congrats to you and your husband!
p375
aV40 days!!\u000a\u000aI quit cigarettes a few months ago in favor of a juul which may have been even more addicting at least for me. 40 days ago I gave it up so now I\u2019m 100% nicotine free! Wooooooo!
p376
aVCongrats to you!\u000a\u000aI´m at 24 days using a Vape-Pen (Exceed D19) and I´m doing fine and I can regulate how much nicotine is in the liquid.\u000a\u000aJuul is very high-nicotine content and I would advise anyone to swith to something else, because you don´t need 50mg/ml especially not if you want to hit it because of the habit and not dependency.\u000a\u000aKeep it up!
p377
aVI did the exact same thing but instead of Juul mine was the Juno,  Crazy addicted to that thing.\u000a\u000aCongratulations on kicking everything to the curb and awesome on those 30 days! \U0001f389
p378
aVWhen does the rage stop? I want to cut off every single friend I have.\u000a\u000aToday is my fifth day nicotine-free. I quit cigarettes a few months back, but I kept using my juul. Enough was enough, so I threw it away and started this adventure.\u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aFor the last two days, though, I've been feeling inexplicably angry. I'm not a very angry person. In fact, I rarely ever get angry. I've deleted every app off my phone, a lot of people's contact information, and in my classes I attempt to make myself look as unapproachable as possible. Obviously this isn't enough to make me want to go back to nicotine. I just need to know how much longer I have with this. Does anyone have any advice for me?
p379
aVMy dad a 30 year cigarette smoker really want to quit but how?\u000a\u000aMy dad desperately needs to stop smoking and wants to, he smokes about 1 pack a day it's ridiculous. How can he quit what will help him? Is a juul a good alternative or just as bad or worse?
p380
aVCongratulations, you\u2019ve got this! I used a juul to get through the first 3 weeks of my quit (I had initially planned to use it for the first month but after misplacing it in week 3, I just went with it). I decided to quit at one of the most stressful points of my life/ career which may seem crazy, but now I can\u2019t use stress as an excuse for backsliding. Last week I hit 2 months smoke free and, aside from one drunken night that I ended up sucking on a straw pretending it was a cigarette, it hasn\u2019t been that bad! Now I feel too stubborn to smoke again, I don\u2019t want to reset my counter! You can do it!!
p381
aVI dropped cigs and only Vaped the juul for a month while browsing this sub silently.. then I dropped the juul. I mainly used this sub as a source of motivation seeing everyone else stopping too.\u000a\u000aJust somethings I noticed.\u000aWithout the vape I don't think I would have been able to quit cigs. I've tried more times than I can count.\u000aDropping cigs and only using juul was pretty simple compared to dropping the ecig too. Nicotine withdrawals are real.\u000aAnyone can do it! \u000a\u000aalso in my humble opinion: this is is the internet, F what people say if you don't like it, simply ignore and move along.\u000a\u000aGood luck, you got this!
p382
aVWorked AMAZING for me, I live in a recreational state and buy the pure CBD cartridges to vape, no THC, no nicotine, no juul etc. No head high or if there\u2019s one I can\u2019t feel it, I can work, focus, workout etc. Just sucks because I travel so much, flying every weekend and I can\u2019t take my vape pen with me for obvious legal reasons. 
p383
aVYou have to resist the urge, it will be difficult but you control your body. Just don\u2019t do it no matter what. I was the same way but I just told myself every time I felt the cravings \u201cthis is how I\u2019m supposed to feel right now, it will get better and better\u201d and it really does. If you do buy a vape I suggest the Juul, it has helped me a lot.
p384
aVFirst time poster, not a first time quitter.\u000a\u000aThe title says it all. Today marks a week since my last cigarette and I seem to be doing okay. I've been sucking on Juul pods like my life depends on it, but I haven't had cravings or anything which tells me the nicotine strength of these little suckers is enough for me. I'm hoping in the coming weeks to start using the Juul less and less, to slowly wean myself off nicotine. I've tried the patch, I've tried gum, I've tried cold turkey, I've tried "cutting back", I feel like I've tried everything but medication. My doctor was excited for me when I went last week and told her that I'm trying to quit, she even went so far as to say she wouldn't badger me about my weight for the time being so as to allow myself to focus on my nicotine consumption, which I thought was pretty cool in and of itself. One addiction at a time I suppose. \u000a\u000aMy mom made a comment that's really stuck with me. I explained that it's been a week since I last smoked a cigarette. She then pointed at my Juul and said "what's that, then?". I mean, she isn't wrong, but on the other hand I'm pretty sure e-cigs are at least marginally healthier than smoking analog. Her heart was in the right place, but I was really hoping she'd be proud of me for staying strong. I guess that's why I'm making this post, for validation. Just typing all this out however seems to be validation enough. I feel good about this choice, and even if I continue to use my Juul for the next couple of months, I'm glad to not smell like smoke or have to leave my apartment for a cigarette anymore.\u000a\u000aHere's to all of y'all who have quit before me and those that will quit after me. We're a strong community, and I'm excited to see what the future brings!\u000a\u000a(Thank you for reading my self-indulgent ramblings)
p385
aVAnyone trying or tried the juul?\u000a\u000aIm ready to quit vaping but i feel pulled to the juul. Ive never had before but the thought of no leaks and better flavour intices me. Im currently using the very similar myblu and its good enough to not smoke. Much better actually. Just wondered if the juul is something to be excited about or end my time vaping without ever having it. I feel like i need to try it.
p386
aVI was curious about a Juul to quit cigarettes.. as a stepdown.\u000a\u000aGood question, man.
p387
aVDo a search here on Juul and you'll see that switching from vaping to a Juul is going from the frying pan into the fire. They are extremely high in nicotine.\u000a\u000aI don't think nicotine addiction in any form is ever something to be excited about. \u000a
p388
aVMy switch from box mod to JUUL was when my nicotine addiction got very bad, so 100% agree here. 
p389
aVI got a JUUL to stop smoking cigarettes and ended up even more nicotine addicted because of it.  Just got a myBlu because the nicotine level is lower in its pods. Seems to be ok so far.  There are a lot more options out there now for small, pen-like vapes other than the JUUL, just make sure to find one with a lower nic level!
p390
aVDude, the withdrawal from juuling is way worse...\u000aMy addiction went from bad to worse the moment I switched...\u000aThose things are crazy high in nicotine...\u000aI\u2019d recommend doing it cold turkey. \u000aThat\u2019s what worked for me. \u000aIt\u2019s two to three weeks of hell and then the rest of your life free so long as you can eat over the occasional craving but even those fade after some time. 
p391
aVI switched to juul on June 1st. My plan was to use it less and less until I'm back nicotine free. I Haven't had a cigarette since but I'm also realizing how addicted I am to this thing. When I can't charge it or if I've misplaced it I start to think "ok maybe I'll just smoke a cigarette for now" I haven't and hopefully will not but it's made me realize in order to no longer be a smoker you have to ditch the nicotine addiction. They also create a lot of waste when you're going through a pod every day or two. I'm glad I was able to stop smoking cigarettes but now I have a new habbit I have to kick.
p392
aVHonestly, you might not even know it but this is one of the best choices you can make. I spent more money on JUULing then I ever did on my box mod, and I am (was) a very avid vaper. It\u2019s a pure nicotine stick and the withdrawal is not worth it, especially when you can get more fulfilling juices and flavors.
p393
aVI have no direct experience with the Juul, but I do with a vape pen. Didn't work for me, actually got more addicted it that thing than I did normal smokes. \u000a\u000aymmv. Good luck!
p394
aVI picked up a juul the other day and have had 2 cigarettes since. The first one was alright but the second one tasted horrendous, like how had I been smoking for that long? The juul seems more satisfying to me too than other vapes I've tried in the past.
p395
aVI've owned four Juuls\u000a\u000aand they did not help me quit. For a while I'd be able to get my nicotine fix from them, but being able to use them inside let me use them constantly, and that only made me more dependent on nicotine. Every time I gave away or threw out a juul, I just went straight back to smoking, and I needed more cigarettes a day than when I "switched". Quitting is hell and drawing it out is making it worse.\u000a\u000aI'm going cold turkey starting today. Wish me luck lads.
p396
aVStop celebrating the Fourth of Juul-aye and celebrate Independence Day instead!
p397
aVSame! The juul pods helped me move off the "take a walk around the block and smoke a cig habit" and I instead replaced it with the adult pacifier. \u000a\u000aI switched to the nicotine patch and holy shit it is working. I think the juul helped me move away from smoking being the way i take a break from life but it made me way way more nicotine dependent.   \u000a\u000a\u000aThe patch really makes withdrawal and urges way easier to manage. I'm on step 2, about 21 days in and I'm feeling really good about my quitting. 
p398
aVJuul+begleri=my new ritual. It\u2019s good.
p399
aVwhat have proven ways been most successful to quit smoking, both for you and based on medical literature?\u000a\u000aI'm trying to help out my mother and a lot of my family. I've thought a lot about things, and researched a lot but I'm not quite sure what to move forward with. I was thinking CBD and maybe other natural remedies that have anti-anxiety / stress properties, and possibly transitioning to a vaporizer such as a juul, or even one that is nicotine free. 
p400
aVI quit with the juul, got one for my dad and now he\u2019s quitting too
p401
aVdid you directly transition from cigs to the juul? slowly taper off? or just drop cigs one day and pick up the juul? some details would be great.
p402
aVI'm 19 and am trying to ween off of nicotine. Any tips?\u000a\u000aI started to become addicted about a year ago when I was regularly chewing tobacco. Prior to that I had vaped low nicotine but that wasn't enough to get me hooked. I ditched the reprehensible habit and switched to a JUUL a few months ago and was going through a pod a day. That's a 4 dollar a day habit. Yesterday I bought some 6 nic juice for my old vape. JUUL's have 50 nic so I thought 6 would be pretty reasonable. I am not fiending for more. I plan to go through this 60 ml bottle and switch to 3 nic after that. I hope this will drastically reduce my addiction if I stick to 3 nic for a couple months and quit all together. \u000a\u000aThis is my first time posting to this sub so I hope I haven't broken any rules. Cheers.
p403
aVYou have been using for a year. You aren't weening yourself off, you are helping to cement your addiction. Throw the Juul, the vape, and any other source of nicotine you have in the garbage and just stop. Within less than a month you will barely remember having ever used tobacco. At that point, the only issue you will ever have is falling into the trap of believing that you are safe to use it occasionally. Don't think about it, don't consider it, don't set a quit date. Just do it now and you'll feel better by the time Labor Day weekend rolls around.
p404
aVThanks. The social isolation was the part of the reason I quit chewing. I was so addicted that I would chew in front of women I was interested in. If I go to a party, half the people have a JUUL and the other half are mooching off of them.

aVDay 1 complete. Looking for advice.\u000a\u000aOk so I\u2019m not addicted to cigarettes, but I am addicted to a juul. This is a vape device that has the same amount of nicotine as a cigarette. I realized that it\u2019s expensive as hell and it\u2019s taking over my life. I told my girlfriend multiple times that I would quit and I tried but failed, then lied and told her I did quit. I put my relationship with her on the line and as soon as I realized how much I had hurt her it was the final straw. I can\u2019t let nicotine control me anymore. Last night was hell because it had been about 12 hours since my last time. I feel somewhat better this morning at about 24 hours in. Do you guys have any advice on how to keep going? Advice on dealing with withdrawal? I really wanna beat my addiction for myself and for her. 
p406
aVI\u2019m also on this journey. I\u2019ve invested in a Juul to help with the process. The creme brûlée pods are my favorite! 
p407
aVI hit a nicotine pen today and had no feeling whats so ever.\u000a\u000aI am really confused. I keep on doing research and can't find anything on this topic. A normal Juul pen is like 50% and this one my friend had was like 30%. When they hit it they tell me they "can't think" or "find it hard to stand" for a few seconds. My friends aren't light weight they are heavy marajana smokers. I know this might not be the right subreddit but it was my 2nd time vaping and I felt nothing. I took good hits with my lungs until I would cough but I felt nothing. Same thing happened the first time. From the first time I had it and the 2nd time it was maybe 2 weeks so I don't believe it is a tolerance. Is it possible to be immune to nicotine? Only thing I got was a light headache right now. If someone who is experienced can help me I'd appreciate it.
p408
aV4 Days Cigarette Free \U0001f91f\U0001f3fc\u000a\u000aIt hasn\u2019t been easy but I\u2019ve come this far and more motivated than ever to never touch one again. My girlfriend and I quit since we came down to Key West for vacation and I\u2019ll admit we\u2019re sucking on plenty of lozenges and smoking a JUUL but we\u2019re already beginning to slow down on them! Love this life. 
p409
aVJust quit smoking but I bought a juul?\u000a\u000aI quit smoking about 3 days ago and it\u2019s been hard but I am still really addicted to nicotine I got a juul for the time being until I can get a CBD Vape I don\u2019t enjoy vaping and I think I might switch to a patch? I smoked a pack a day so this is hard any help would be grateful 
p410
aVFrom what I've seen on here, the Juul does nothing to get you over the addiction. Sure, you get away from a lot of the nasty stuff that cigarettes have, but you'll stay just as addicted, if not worse. I'd suggest anything else but it. \u000a\u000aJust my $0.02 though. Hang in there. At least stay off of cigarettes. 
p411
aVthank you! I know the juul isn\u2019t helping my actual addiction I just hope once I get my CBD pen I can really stay away from nicotine and cigarettes in general 
p412
aVHere with ya, on day 6 of quitting the Juul myself. No more nicotine!
p413
aVI was in the same position as you about 3 weeks ago. I picked up a e-cig (like the JUUL they sell there in the States). It's still got nicotine, but the dosage is so low so the withdrawal symptoms don't hit so hard. I'm down to taking a few  drags once in the morning and then before I go to bed. This coming from smoking a pack a day to me is a huge victory. I still get tiny cravings, but I eat an apple every time it happens. A craving lasts approx 3 minutes so do something else to take your mind of it. I say take the leap and quit. Get a e-cig and give it a go.
p414
aVFound a website that says it's 18mg/ml. That's pretty high up there. No where near Juul level, but as much as a real cigarette. When I quit I started out with 9mg/ml. \u000a\u000aHang in there, hopefully it'll just be a quick detox this time. 
p415
aVHow I Quit the Juul\u000a\u000aThe Juul is a discrete chrome device that will soon become all you can think about. It becomes attached to you like an extra limb and will not let go. It is under your pillow while you sleep and with you for the third unnecessary trip to the bathroom at work. It gives you a rush that at one time tasted like mint but now tastes like faded wintergreen windex. Rather quickly actually, you become insistent on its presence and you become completely forlorn without it. Even on the short trip to the bathroom downstairs, before you get into the shower and after you towel off, you make sure it is there. This is my first week without it and while not easy to let go, I needed to. It is marketed as a safe alternative but I know we have still yet to truly understand its long term effects on people.  The crime here is not the fruity flavors being marketed to kids but that Juul is well aware we do not need 5 mg's of nicotine. They are aware that anyone who buys one will be massively addicted in under a week.
p416
aVThe biggest problem I see is that, unlike cigarettes, you can get away with getting a fix almost anywhere. When I started vaping to quit I had to force myself to treat it like a cigarette so I wasn't constantly puffing on it. I was using very low nicotine levels, so I can only imagine what a Juul would be like. \u000a\u000aHang in there, you can beat this. \u000a\u000a\u000a&gt;Juul is well aware we do not need 5 mg's of nicotine.\u000a\u000aAlso, slight correction and probably just a type-o, but you said the Juul was 5mg. It's more like 50mg. You're point is very well taken regardless. 
p417
aVDefinitely a big thing down here for the rush, see tons of people with one of these now.\u000a\u000aAlmost tastes like a cigar/cigarette, it's weird. I've tried someone else's Juul with a mango flavor -- reminded me of a blunt.\u000a\u000aYeah they like the rush but that rush goes away! Good for you on putting it down, within a week or two I doubt you'll think about it as much. Once week one is down, half the battle is won.\u000a\u000aGood luck, you can do it!
p418
aVCongrats on quitting! I'm so so glad to see a fellow Juul quitter here, I quit smoking cigarettes years ago but unfortunately got lured back into vaping. I was at most a 10 a day cigarette smoker, but with the Juul I'd have days I went through a pod and a half (Juul estimates 1 pod to be about 20 cigs worth of nicotine). Day 4 here of zero nicotine, right here with ya!
p419
aVAddicted to Juuling\u000a\u000aI am addicted to juuling- I was never a smoker except when I drank( I\u2019ve been sober for 4 and a half months) how do I quit? I feel so tempted and always think about it- I get to 8 days or so then cave back in. I know it\u2019s not as harsh as quitting cigarettes but any advice? 
p420
aVFirstly is "Juuling" not smoking but regardless:\u000a\u000aSwitch to normal Vape(-Pen) and taper off the nicotine in the liquid if the nicotine-withdrawal is your problem and stop vaping once you are at 0 nicotine or maybe jump off at 3mg or 1.5mg/ml.
p421
aVI just quit juuling cold turkey a week ago. It's bad the first few days, but gets easier. The hardest part is insomnia. Let's just say it is 5am currently... yeah. The only way to stop juuling is to go cold turkey. Cutting down your intake is too tempting/easy to forget. I suggest throwing it in the trash. \u000a\u000aIf you don't mind insomnia for a week or so, then you will be okay. I've been getting 2-4 hours a night. Other than that, it's not that hard. \u000a\u000aAlso, exercising like riding a bike helps a lot by getting aggression out. \u000a\u000aMy biggest tip for you is to make the decision to never juul again before you quit- otherwise you will run straight back to it after the first couple of days (which are the hardest).\u000a\u000aQuitting is not easy by any means but it is also not as hard as you think. Its better to quit than be enslaved by an addicting market that wants your money at any cost to you. \u000a\u000aGood luck!
p422
aVI can't lie, Day 2 and a hit from my juul sound pretty nice right now.\u000a\u000aThought I'd post here instead of caving. Guess it doesnt help I'm buzzing just a bit.
p423
aVI quit smoking by vaping. Different techniques work for different people. It's my opinion that if you are reducing your nicotine level regularly and working your way toward nicotine freedom, vaping is good. If you pick up a Juul and start sucking down the same amount of nicotine you were when you were smoking, you've just swapped one delivery mechanism for another. 
p424
aVHonestly, you are still addicted to a form of smoking so I would kindly say that it's not really even close. Not to judge you, just to be real. I tried using a Juul for a few weeks. I was just a smoker using a Juul instead of a cigarette.
p425
aVNo nicotine for a week.\u000a\u000aI quit smoking cigarettes about 8 months ago and switched to a Juul thinking it will help me quit. Fast forward 8 months and I\u2019m pounding down more nicotine than ever before. So I finally trashed that a week ago and holy heck nicotine withdrawals suck. I finally had my first good nights sleep since I quit last night which was cool. 
p426
aVThat\u2019s one reason I finally ditched the Juul, not having an option to decrease the nicotine level made me realize they are not trying to help you quit just trying to make you use the Juul in lieu of tobacco.
p427
aVQuitting vaping 1 1/2 years after I quit smoking cigarettes!\u000a\u000aSo, I quit smoking cigarettes a little over 1 1/2 years ago, but picked up vaping about 7 months ago when I worked in a restaurant. I smoked a Juul and I could see the effects of nicotine in my complexion, in the headaches and stomachaches I would have, the way it drained my wallet, and the anxiety of not being able to find it. I am on day two, and honestly it hasn\u2019t been as difficult as it was to quit cigarettes, but not exactly easy either. I\u2019m a little foggy in the head and want to eat everything. I made some healthy chicken soup so I can just eat if I need to, as well as packs of gum (no nicotine) since I gained 30 pounds I\u2019m still trying to get off slowly but surely after quitting cigarettes. Cheers to everyone fighting their battles to quit! We deserve better! Good luck!!
p428
aVSounds like a tight mouth to lung draw would be good for you. Which is also nice because those products usually cost less, use less juice, and use less battery power. You could start with a Juul or something like that. Nice and easy. If you think that might not be enough, get a mod and a tank. Then you can change you're juice easily and they cost less than pod systems in the long run. If you do get a Juul or some kind of pen style little guy, GO TO A VAPE SHOP. The shit they sell in gas stations is cheap, but they break easily, aren't very satisfying, and have short battery life. You don't want to be in the middle of a craving only to find out you're vape is dead.
p429
aVOnce You Go Long Enough Without Smoking, Do You Ever Smoke Socially?\u000a\u000aWhat's up guys, I recently stopped using nicotine. I was up to about a Juul pod a day (for roughly 6 months) and sorta just figured I gotta stop this shit eventually.   \u000a\u000a\u000aI really didn't find the quitting process that hard. Don't get me wrong, I can see how for some people it would suck and I got all of the symptoms but I just told myself not to be a pussy. It's now three days later and I'm still getting some cravings but feel like I beat the worst of it. My only question is if I rip my buddies' Juul once or twice during a night out, am I going to have to go through the whole WD phase all over again? The cloudy head phase suuuucked. 
p430
aVThe overwhelming answer here will be, as it should be, "Don't do it. It's bad." This is a forum of people who are at serious stages of quitting, so this is the only correct answer to your question.\u000a\u000aAs someone who's using vape as an NRT to remain smoke free, however, I infer from your post that you've already resigned yourself to a social relapse being an inevitability. If this is the case, then I guess what you really should be asking is, "How can I minimize the damage?"\u000a\u000aFirst of all, it's at least somewhat positive that you intend to relapse with a vape and not an actual cigarette. It's definitely the lesser of two evils.\u000a\u000aIf there's no question at this point that you've already made up your mind that you're definitely going to vape socially, I recommend avoiding your buddy's Juul and investing in your own vape that allows you to choose a low nicotine or, preferably NO nicotine juice option.\u000a\u000aEither you'll decide, a) "I like to vape socially. Even without nicotine, it prevents me from smoking which is my ultimate goal," or b) "Vaping without nicotine is pointless. I don't enjoy it. Therefore I need to quit vaping altogether."\u000a\u000aSo again, no you shouldn't do it. But if you're already going to do it anyway, at least try to minimize the damage. 
p431
aVI mean, the thing is that I have pretty solid willpower, but I love to get drunk with my boys and I'll probably take a few rips of one of their Juuls the next time we go out boozing. It's not like I'm gonna wake up the next morning and go throw another $50 down the drain to buy my own Juul afterwards, I just don't wanna go through the whole foggy head/anxiety thing for another two days if I rip one of my friends. 
p432
aVFair. Only reason I'd assume my case would be different is because I was only Juuling for 6 months and wasn't ever hopelessly addicted to it. Just kinda enjoyed ripping Juul. 
p433
aVThe Juul pods pack a much higher dose of nicotine than even most cigarettes, though, which is why I'm suggesting investing in your own vape with low to no nicotine over the Juul.
p434
aVYou're right. It's definitely good advice. I'll probably try to find some 0 nic juice I can refill my Juul pods with. It's really the social aspect and act of taking a rip that I enjoy. Better alternative then getting drunk and bumming all my friends' Juuls anyway. 
p435
aV10 Days In\u000a\u000aHi everyone, \u000a\u000aI am 10 days free from smoking, but the cravings are still hitting me like a freight train sometimes.  I've been using my Juul to help and it's really beneficial, although I'm afraid I'm only trading one vice for another.  Any cut back tips to provide someone who smoked for 10 years roughly?  I've gone these whole 10 days without picking up a single cigarette, which is better than any attempt of mine thus far.  
p436
aVI got off of cigarettes with the Juno ( similar to the Juul). For me I went from being addicted to vaping instead of smoking. I\u2019m not sure how good vaping is in terms of getting completely off nicotine, but it\u2019s probably one of the best way to actually get people off cigarettes.\u000a\u000aI stopped vaping over three months ago and maybe quitting after vaping made it a little easier.  I\u2019m convinced  that big tobacco puts addictive things in cigarettes to make it harder to quit. 100% convinced.\u000a\u000aGood luck!\u000a\u000a
p437
aVThank you man I appreciate it! \u000aI think it just depends on how long you use. \u000aI\u2019ve heard some people say it takes two months while others said two weeks, were all different. \u000aFor me it was a mont and five days.\u000a\u000aHow long did you use and roughly how much? \u000aI was using about a juul pod a day along with some dip and one or two backwoods gas station cigars. (I know, disgusting) \u000aI was only addicted for roughly a year though before I knew I had to quit. 
p438
aVOver 3 weeks without a cigarette!!!\u000a\u000aI don't know if this counts, because I bought a Sourin Air (vape thing similar to a juul) so I still am addicted to nicotine. However, I'm working on weening myself off by lowering the nicotine amount gradually.\u000a\u000aI'm only 20, and I started smoking at 18 because I'm in the military and everyone uses tobacco. It's a great way to get a break and relieves stress in times when there's plenty of it to go around. I got up to over a pack a day and a few weeks ago I just decided enough was enough. \u000a\u000aEvery couple days though I feel a burning desire to light one up, but it usually passes quickly. I know it's not much of a milestone but I'm just happy to not be smoking cigarettes and wanted to share :)
p439
aVTry salt nicotine in a pod system! I picked up one called Juul at a gas station and it\u2019s helped me tons. Gave me the same throat feel as a cigarette. The other day I upgraded to one called the Aspire Breeze 2. Mainly because it\u2019s refillable and the juul pods are like $20 for a 4 pack. Still less than I was spending on smoking, but still not cheap. Each juul pod is comparable to a pack of cigarettes, but I found I wasn\u2019t going through an entire pod a day. Usually salt nicotine is very high concentrates so it\u2019ll get you the nicotine fix very efficiently. 
p440
aVUpdate: I've been totally cigarette free for a week. I'd cut down a little bit every day, supplementing in a traditional vape and nicotine gum. The big change was getting a JUUL (which I'll admit I thought were some dumb hipster shit until I tried one), which took my from half a pack a day to 2 cigarettes a day almost immediately. Here's to hoping I'm still cigarette free come Halloween! I even did some heavy drinking over the weekend and didn't succumb! 
p441
aVAlmost Fell in it Again\u000a\u000aMy journey is sort of weird \u2014 I never really smoked cigs. I started with spliffs, eventually ripping like 6-8 spliffs a day, and drunk cigs on weekends. I wanted to quit smoking so I took up vaping... and it made it 5x worse and I became a juul pod every other day vaper.\u000a\u000aI quit all this a couple months ago, but recently decided to smoke a blunt with a friend. It was nice! I loved it! And I was interested because back when I smoked spliffs I never smoked blunts because it was tooo much weed.\u000a\u000aSo the next day I smoked another blunt \u000a\u000aAnd again the next day\u000a\u000aAnd again the day after...\u000a\u000aI realized that I really liked it because the small amount of nicotine in the wrap. It was a way to cheat - I had quit cigs, vapes, and spliffs but a blunt was OK in my mind. However this was a bad line of reasoning - nicotine is nicotine no matter how small and I was forming a habit again!\u000a\u000aSo I stopped a few days ago - back to nicotine free. 
p442
aVTwo things. First, consider reading Allen Carr's book. You need to reprogram the way you view cigarettes. Once you finally understand that smoking doesn't help with stress, you can deal with the cravings a lot better.\u000a\u000aSecond, NRT isn't going to stop you from having cravings, that's not the point of it. NRT is to help control the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can focus on the mental cravings. About the only thing that I have heard people using that will get you off of cigarettes with no withdrawal is a Juul, but when you do that you're just trading one addiction for another and you'll never get free.\u000a\u000aThe only way to get clean is to go through the process. Take a deep breath, toss out the cigarettes, and don't smoke again. It isn't going to be easy, you're going to crave a cigarette, you're brain is even going to fight you through the process, coming up with some pretty good arguments for why you should smoke. You are going to have to fight through it and know that eventually, you'll be free.\u000a\u000aYou said that you're a veteran. That means you went through basic. AFAIK, you can't smoke in basic, which means that you've gone at least 8 weeks without a cigarette before. If you can make it 8 weeks without a cigarette again, you'll be free of the physical addiction and at a point where you'll be strong enough to fight off cravings when they occur. Focus on that. Just make it 8 weeks. You've done it before, you can do it again.
p443
aVDay 10 and already noticing some significant positive changes to my health!\u000a\u000aHi all,\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve been a long time lurker, but finally decided to quit last Monday. I had smoked for about a year (not more than 10 a day) but then switched to vaping (Juul). From there, I increased my nicotine consumption to the point where I was having the equivalent of 1 pack/day. \u000a\u000aWith the Juul, it\u2019s easy to overlook just how much nicotine you\u2019re consuming. I probably would have continued had I not also been building my budget the day I quit. I looked through my past transactions and realized that I\u2019d spent almost $1000 on Juul pods over 8 months.\u000a\u000aAnyways, I decided to use low-dose NRT (first lozenges, now a Step 3 patch). Despite cutting my daily nicotine use from 50mg to 7mg, I haven\u2019t had terrible cravings and will just pop a piece of gum in when I do. And I\u2019m already noticing some significant health benefits! I\u2019ve been getting better sleep, albeit with some strange dreams and a few nightmares. Some of my IBS symptoms have disappeared, and it feels like my lungs are able to keep up with strenuous activity for the first time in months. A lot of this is probably placebo, but even so it has motivated me to keep up with the NRT regimen and manage my cravings. \u000a\u000aIt feels good to finally be a part of this community, and I\u2019m looking forward to continuing my journey with y\u2019all. Here\u2019s to hoping that I can keep building on this progress! \u000a\u000aSide note, what is the name of the app that I see all of these screenshots from? Feel like that could help me out as well.
p444
aVQuit smoking for almost 3 weeks now. Smoking since I was 16 and turning 22 next month. Switched to using a Juul. Wondering about next step and what to look forward to.\u000a\u000aHello everyone, I'm new to this subreddit! I've finally feel like I can quit smoking cigarettes after switching to the juul. It's been almost 3 weeks (Had my last cigarette on July 5th 2018).  \u000a  \u000aI started smoking since I was 16 and I'm turning 22 next month. I remember my first cigarette on Halloween of my sophomore year of high school. I finally went to my first high school party and wanted to fit and became a social smoker ever since. Then it quickly escalated to smoking a cigarette daily and when I got to college the stress made me smoke even more! I went from smoking 1 cigarette a night my freshmen year of college to smoking more than half a pack a day my senior year of college... I wanted to quit before I became a "pack a day" smoker.  \u000a  \u000aEver since I quit I noticed that my heart rate went down, my blood pressure definitely dropped, Breathing is so much easier, my sense of smell improved, and (my favorite part) my sense of taste improved drastically. I never realized how good food tasted!  \u000a  \u000aThere's only 1 fear that I have. My cravings for cigarettes are very rare, but I feel like I rely on my juul way too much. I always have to have it with me or I feel anxious. I also go through those suckers like hot cakes. If I get to a comfortable point, I plan to end my nicotine dependency altogether, but how would I approach it? Since the juuls are so much easier to puff on and provide a surprisingly high amount of nicotine I feel like my nicotine dependency got worse.  \u000aAlso, what are other things to look forward to (improvements in health) as time goes on because I'm really enjoying the benefits of ridding my body of cancer sticks.  
p445
aVI did the Juul for the first 30 days, and I\u2019ve been off nicotine now for 3 days. For me, the Juul wasn\u2019t nearly as hard to kick as cigarettes. I just carry some Nicorette around in case I\u2019m feeling tempted. No issues yet, and congrats on quitting!
p446
aVDid nicotine free give you the good throat hit though? I don\u2019t like the juul because it gave me a headache and i was crazy hooked on it still. But I want a nicotine free vape for when I drink. I just want something that gives me an ok throat hit while I\u2019m drinking.
p447
aVCongrats on moving away from smoking. There are  non nicotine juul compatible pods that may interest you at [https://cyclonepods.com](https://cyclonepods.com/). It has helped some people ween themselves away from nicotine.
p448
aVI use the Eleaf iStick 30W. It was the first 'large contraption' type vape I ever got because the little vape pens like the Juul, Blu, etc never worked for me. I always went back to smoking in a week or 2. The benefit to the larger, adjustable vapes is that you can control the size and feel of your hits. I like a lower temp and an...uh... easy suck I guess. I don't want to have to pull hard. Also, I like flavorless juice. I never liked any flavor that I tried that's out there, they all leave a weird aftertaste in my mouth and most are super sweet. With this, I can buy flavorless juices with whatever nicotine content I want. I started with 18mg so they vape would be "better" than cigs. I still currently vape 3mg, sometimes 6mg. Before my relapse several montha ago I was mixing 0mg with 3, just when I "needed" it, like when I'm drinking or around other vapers or smokers.
p449
aVExactly. Everyone was telling me, "bro pick up a juul". But its the act of smoking in itself that is equally as addictive as the nicotine. What also helps is stepping outside like you would have a cigarette/vape and take some breaths of fresh air. Take your break outside just dont smoke. That break feeling really helps too.
p450
aVI\u2019ve actually been juuling for awhile now and it was really easy to switch from cigs to vape but I\u2019m definitely more addicted to the high nicotine in juul pods than I was with cigs. How long did it take for you to start to feel normal again?
p451
aVI honestly don't remember. I bought a 30-40 dollar vape from a local vape store. I figured that buying 50 bucks worth of vape stuff wouldn't matter in the long run in savings. Dont buy the JUUL or other brands that are pre-packaged. Buy a vape pen that you put liquid in yourself. It's more expensive, but the $3,900 I've saved since then doesn't mind much.:)
p452
aVI did the exact thing you\u2019re doing. Stopped smoking started JUULing. It was great but I felt way more addicted to nicotine. So I quit. I was straight up mad for 2 day, then sad 2 day, then felt ok. I\u2019m going on 2 weeks now and cravings are there but so small and short that you forget about them. Still getting cravings though. Hopefully they go away after awhile and I can put this all behind me. I smoked for 10 years, a pack a day. 
p453
aVForced to quit smoking/vaping from surgery; is there anything similar to a nicotine buzz?\u000a\u000aI recently got a septoplasty (septum surgery) and i couldn\u2019t keep my juul down and over a few days the nicotine messed up my recovery to the point where my septum cartilage is exposed through a hole in my nose and it\u2019s not closing up soon, so i smashed my juul to pieces and flushed it. I\u2019m going through withdrawals and i\u2019m craving the feeling of nicotine buzz and trying to stop myself from picking up another vape or a pack of smokes. I know it\u2019s not smart to look for other alternatives as opposed to completely quitting but for the time being while i recover from surgery, is there anything that\u2019s similar to a nicotine buzz (short burst of dizziness; lightheadedness)? 
p454
aVi'll just say this, i had to get 5 teeth extracted and found myself smoking through my god damn nose at a bar high as fuck on oxies to avoid getting a dry socket.  at a certain point, addicts like us need to understand that we are literally willing to do anything for a fix, short term satisfaction, than to deal with the temporary discomfort of getting through healing and recovery.  \u000a\u000ait isn't about the juul, the nicotine, the physical urge for the buzz.  we need to find ways of distracting ourselves.  download tetris, make yourself a cup of tea, cut your toenails, think about how ridiculous your nose will look if you continue being a fiend, etc.  there are other alternatives; an endless amount of alternatives to nicotine.  you need to ask yourself, am i looking for a substitute chemical or a new behavior?

aVStop Juuling (vaping): Nicotine Gum or Patches\u000a\u000aHey all,\u000a\u000aBeen looking to quit Juuling for quite some time now but have been very lost. Someone suggested either gum or patches and was like duh, obviously give that a shot.\u000a\u000aI've seen both gum and patches on Amazon but all with a max of 4/5 star reviews; does anyone here have a preference for which has helped them the most?\u000a\u000aI vape about one Juul pod a day (they say it's about a pack of cigarettes) and I'm thinking I'd do either 4mg nicotine gum or Step 1 patches.\u000a\u000a\u000aAny input would be great, thank you!
p456
aVHey bro I know this is a bit late but you\u2019re not alone.\u000aI\u2019ve suffered terrible panic attacks and have had derealization/depersonalization since I was about 12. \u000aI\u2019m 19 now and turning 20 in August and I had always experimented with nicotine such as dip and vapes starting at age 14 but did not become addicted until last year.\u000aAfter a year of using a disgusting amount of nicotine often times smoking a cigar a day along with going through 1 to 2 juul pods on top of that and sometimes some dip thrown In for good measure my girlfriend found all my stuff on June 25th and I vowed to quit.\u000a\u000aWell dude let me tell you, I was not prepared for the two week constant panic attack and horrible brain fog and derealization that followed.\u000aI constantly went to the e.r thinking something was wrong with me and was on the verge of believing I was going insane everyday.\u000a\u000aFinally, after a bit over two weeks I accepted that this was indeed just nicotine withdrawal. \u000aIt is my first day of week three and the brain fog and derealization is about 60% better and so is the anxiety. I know it\u2019s scary but you have to power through it, grit your teeth and do whatever you can to make it through and you will be able to do this, you\u2019re not alone and you\u2019re stronger than you think. Put your mind to the test and beat this horrible addiction and don\u2019t look back.\u000a\u000aAll studies I\u2019ve read said it takes six weeks for your brain chemistry to normalize after you quit smoking and dude I believe it. With my rate of progress I would say me being back to normal in another three weeks sounds about right. \u000a\u000aDon\u2019t be afraid to book an appointment with your psychiatrist to help you manage and don\u2019t get into the pattern of letting your panic attacks control you because then they will follow you long after the withdrawal has gone. 
p457
aVHaven't had a cigarette in over a month. I smoke my Juul daily tho. Does it count?\u000a\u000aCan I consider myself a non-smoker, or am I just lying to myself?
p458
aVI think you\u2019re still considered a smoker while you inhale any form of nicotine, I might be wrong though, if you plan on quitting 100% then the Juul will only prolong the addiction like any nicotine replacement does.
p459
aVF that. You are a non smoker!!! No more trips to the gas station. No more standing in the rain, cold, heat just to smoke a cigarette. No more smelling like an ashtray. No more planning your day around your smoke breaks. The Juul has done so much for me and I'm so thankful for it. Worry about the Juul in the future. Just stay strong and never smoke a cigarette again. Plus I guess technically you are vaping with a Juul and not smoking so by definition you are not a smoker. Congrats on quitting. You are definitely a non-smoker
p460
aVI just started using Juul two days ago and it helped me. 
p461
aVI finally made it a full day!\u000a\u000aI've commented and posted about quitting off and on this year but I've finally made it well past the 24hr mark. Technically it's been 37 hours and I feel great! I feel like I'm cheating because I did purchase a juul but this is how I've made it this far. I plan on tappering off my use of that over the next 2 weeks. I'm so happy though! 
p462
aV1 Month no Cigs, 2 Days no nicotine. This is hard. Emotional.\u000a\u000aI switched to a JUUL last month and it was amazing. Could not believe I could replace cigarettes! I was a pack a day smoker for the past 7 years... Now I decided to cut out the JUUL...this is hard \u000a\u000aThe first two days I was in the most horrible mood ever. Everything pissed me off. Today I just want to cry. I \u201cmiss\u201d nicotine. How great it went with everything. Caffeine, working, pot, drinking, after a meal. I\u2019m having a hard time seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. 
p463
aVBut why quit the JUUL? Just vape. 
p464
aVQuit tobacco 120 days ago today, but hooked on Juul right now. Any tips on breaking the habit for good?\u000a\u000a
p465
aVI'm in the same boat about 3 weeks in, Juul Has to be not as bad a cigs... But it is easier to quit... That's the gambit you and I are playing, at this point it's just gotta be... You forget to charge it one night... See how long you can go without the charge then just progressively use it less and less... I mean the end goal is to quit right? I'm with you on this, these techniques are starting to work for me as well\u000a\u000aAnother thing I've been doing, is Juul is very easy to use because you can use it in your house.. Just never hit it for pleasure, just when you feel the chemical imbalance. Everytime you bring it up to your mouth you have to have the goal that you are going to quit, our brains are elastic and if you keep telling your self this it will eventually start to be true! 
p466
aVBrain Fog/Anxiety need advice!\u000a\u000aSo I quit smoking cold turkey exactly 14 days ago (two weeks) and I also suffer from an anxiety disorder and have had panic attacks since age 13.\u000aI\u2019m 19 years old and smoking and used dip along with also juuling for about a year. \u000aLong story short, my nicotine use was insanely high. \u000aWell it\u2019s been 14 days since quitting and I\u2019m still feeling restless and am having constant 24/7 anxiety and horrible brain fog. \u000aI\u2019m not as bad as week 1 but the duration is honestly starting to scare me.\u000aTo anyone else who quit, I just need to know, how long does the brain fog and constant anxiety last and when does it start to get better? \u000aI\u2019ve already decided using nicotine again is not an option and with how terrible I feel I never want too again but I just need to know how long before I start getting better. 
p467
aVI love my Juul. MyBlu will help in a bind too.
p468
aVThe Blu's are like $1. Juul's too but a stater pack is like $50
p469
aVJust picked up a Juul and am on day 4 of no smoking. I've been going through a pod every 2 days but it seems like I am starting to vape more. I'm scared of getting MORE addicted to nicotine with these high nicotine vapes. Whats your average pod use?
p470
aVI go through about the same. The way I see it is that I am no longer smoking cigs with tar and other super harmful chemicals, so it works for now. I plan on stopping the Juul soon though. For me, I have already noticed my smokers cough went away and my teeth are white again! YAY! (For reference, I was a pack a day smoker for over 10 years, so this is a huge improvement for me). As long you know that you wont vape forever, I think that's the best attitude to have. I've tried cold turkey, patches, gum etc, but the Juul is the only thing that had curbed my cravings and kept me successful in not smoking actual cigs. Good luck friend. You can do it!
p471
aVA couple of tries ago, I tried to stop smoking by using a Juul. Big mistake! I think if you are going to quit, it should be from vaping, juuling, etc., as well. True, you are dropping the tobacco, but you are still inhaling nicotine and other substances. They haven't been around long enough to know the long term effects. Even though you are getting nicotine and other stuff with vaping, you are not getting the same out of it because there is much more to smoking than we initially think about. There's the lighter. There's the act of lighting a cigarette and then watching it burn away as you smoke it. You don't' get that from vaping. Good luck to you! I know you can do it!  
p472
aVI had that issue too. THis time i'm sticking with pod system vapes like the Juul. I just buy replacement pods at the gas station and dont have to worry about juices coils etc etc.. So far so good.
p473
aV36 hours in...\u000a\u000aSo I\u2019m 36 hours without a cigarette. I don\u2019t really know how I feel. It sucks for sure, but doesn\u2019t seem as bad as the past times I\u2019ve tried. Granted I have been home playing video games and napping for these 36 hours. I bought a Juul ecig and feel very guilty about it. It helps though. I was very dizzy and nauseous yesterday so I went out and bought one. I feel like I\u2019m cheating. I\u2019m happy I haven\u2019t had a cigarette in the longest time in 16 years, but don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m doing it \u201cright\u201d. Can anyone reassure me that what I\u2019m doing is better, or on the flip side, confirm that I\u2019m cheating? I feel like crying either way. 
p474
aVDitch the Juul. Those things are full of nicotine, so every time you hit it you're setting yourself back. Either use patch, gum, or lozenges, or get a low nicotine level vape to take the edge off.
p475
aVOk, but doesn\u2019t the gum losenges etc have nicotine as well? I went for the juul because of the notion of puffing it more than anything. Where would I find a low level vape? The juul says it\u2019s 5%. How much lower should I be looking for?
p476
aVGum, lozenges, and the patch all have nicotine in them. That's why they're called nicotine replacement therapy. The idea behind them though is that they have less nicotine than a cigarette, and you are breaking the mental habit of smoking, even while you are still getting nicotine into your body. They also have levels of nicotine that you can select from, so you can step down the amount of nicotine that you're using. \u000a\u000aVaping with regular juice allows this also, though it does nothing for the mental habit. You can select how much nicotine is in the juice that you use. The problem with the Juul is that you really can't change the nicotine level, and the nicotine level is extremely high. \u000a\u000aThis means that when using the Juul you are still puffing on something, reinforcing your mental habit, and you are still getting similar levels of nicotine, maintaining your physical addiction. In essence, a Juul is literally nothing more than a electronic cigarette and you are still smoking. Granted, your aren't getting the tar, ammonia, and other nasty chemicals that a cigarette would give you, but you're not doing anything to help you with either. \u000a\u000aNow, let's compare a Juul to regular vape. You said that a Juul had 5% nicotine, but that's not how regular vape is measured. It is measured in mg of nicotine per ml of juice. I had to look it up, but apparently the Juul is 59mg/ml. I used vape to get me through the quitting process, but I started with 9mg/ml, then stepped down to 6mg/ml, then 3mg/ml, then 0mg/ml. \u000a\u000aLet's compare the two. When I was vaping, I was using about 5ml of juice a day. That means that at the worst I was using 45mg of nicotine a day, and on the 3mg juice, only 15mg of nicotine per day. By contrast, the same amount of Juul would give you 295mg of nicotine per day. There's also the fact that I was stepping down my nicotine levels so that after about a month I was only getting 15mg per day, whereas that isn't an option with the Juul and after a month you'll still be getting 295mg per day. \u000a\u000aHopefully this all makes sense. Essentially, I don't see how the Juul can be considered a quit smoking tool any more than switching from cigarettes to dip is. It is just changing out one delivery method for another. \u000a\u000a**Side note:** It is my understanding that there are ways to modify a Juul so that it gives less nicotine, but...\u000a\u000a1) real people aren't going to modify their Juul, they're going to use it the way it came. \u000a2) even if you modify the Juul, it still starts at 59mg, which is extremely high. \u000a\u000aBecause of these factors, I willfully ignore the ideas of modifying the Juul and still reject it as a method of quitting. 
p477
aVWow, that\u2019s awesome information. I understand everything you\u2019re saying. I\u2019ve heard of nicotine levels in e cigs and always thought the average was 3-18mg. When I saw Juul bad 5 I figured it was on the low end. I understand now that it\u2019s just labeled differently. I\u2019ll ditch it then. Do you have any recommendations for ecigs that are lower nicotine? 
p478
aVOver 2 months and randomly starting dreaming of smoking?!\u000a\u000aObligatory on mobile, formatting may suck.\u000a\u000aI stopped smoking cigarettes in December and used a juul til the end of February when I stopped using nicotine completely. I did have about a pack worth of screw ups while drinking in April and felt withdraws. So for that fact alone I\u2019ve been considered myself as actually quitting in April. But the actual habit/routine has been broken since December! I\u2019ve drank to the point of being drunk a few times since April and never once smoked. \u000a\u000aSo why for the past two weeks EVERY night I dream I\u2019m smoking. Sometimes I wake up relieved, sometimes I wake up sad that I \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d have a cigarette. I don\u2019t like smoking! I don\u2019t like how it makes me smell, how it ruins my breathing, how it makes me unhealthy and will prematurely age me. I have NO reason to want to smoke! Yet I keep waking up depressed and craving a cigarette as if I just quit yesterday. \u000a\u000aHas this happened to anyone else? Is there some kind of logic to why now?
p479
aV2nd day, not handling the withdrawal symptoms very well no matter how I distract myself.Any advice?\u000a\u000aAs post says, I\u2019ve decided to quit smoking for good because I wanted to save my long term health and be a better influence for my gfs child. I decided to try cold turkey once again for the 2nd time, and I have not been handling it well. For the past two days I have done nothing but sleep, and I can\u2019t seem to concentrate on anything, even the simplest tasks like making breakfast. I\u2019ve been told to distract myself with things I enjoy/hobbies, but I still have extremely bad cravings. I almost relapsed today and was going to buy a pack of JUUL pods, but realized I have no money to spend on them. Is there any other coping strategies or other things I can apply to my life to get through this period of time? Thanks!
p480
aVi got a juul and it has been incredible. i bought a regular vaporizer but it didn\u2019t really help with the craving for a cigarette, so then i was doing both. juul is great because it\u2019s discreet, doesn\u2019t leave huge vapor clouds everywhere and delivers the nicotine you\u2019re craving. most importantly it draws like a cigarette and has a throat hit like a cigarette. i have smoked a few since getting the juul and i haven\u2019t enjoyed them at all. give yourself a week or two on the juul and maybe you\u2019ll be lucky like me. most successful i\u2019ve been at not buying cigarettes in ten years, and i have no plans to buy more. \u000a\u000aTL;DR: the juul has helped me immensely and was a great way for me to quit. 
p481
aVVaping is a good way to avoid cigs, but the one drawback is that you WILL use the vape A LOT. It doesn\u2019t stink, you can do it nearly anywhere, and it feels better on the lungs. I got a Juul and it kept me from cigs but my nicotine dependence skyrocketed because it was so easy to use it all the time. \u000a\u000aI would highly recommend checking out ZYN tobacco free nicotine pouches. It\u2019s a little pouch that you tuck under your upper lip and after it flattens out it\u2019s virtually unnoticeable. It\u2019s not like dip or chew either, you don\u2019t have to spit or anything. It delivers a satisfactory nicotine hit. \u000a\u000aI like ZYN because you\u2019re not inhaling anything, you get a rockin buzz, it\u2019s as discrete as you can get, it\u2019s very reasonably priced, and, most importantly, it\u2019s super easy to moderate your consumption. \u000a\u000aCheck out ZYN. It\u2019s really great. It\u2019ll do your lungs a favor, and because it\u2019s tobacco free it doesn\u2019t make your teeth yellow or anything like that. It has helped me not smoke or vape and has helped me reduce nicotine intake by boatloads.\u000a[ZYN website!!](https://zyn.com/find) 
p482
aVNope absolutely not. \u000aIf you have your addiction/tolerance very low then yes weaning off is VERY easy with vaping.\u000a\u000aVaping has its own addictiveness however because you can do it anywhere. I vaped more then I smoked so I threw out my juul. WHICH BTW IS MORE ADDICTIVE. Then bought customizable juices, I am now smoke free but have a problem with oral fixations.\u000a
p483
aVIf you went with a Juul you could get some non nicotine pods as well. There are some at [https://cyclonepods.com](https://cyclonepods.com/). Best of luck quitting cigarettes and nicotine!
p484
aVi got a juul to help with cravings of oral fixation and nicotine. gum is great too. 
p485
aVIts true, yankees stadium doesnt allow it, nor does prudential center in newark, who used to have an outdoor deck for smoking. I juul now so i can just do it discreetly or goto the bathroom and take a few pulls. quitting this thing might be harder than cigs, but thanks to the juul i havent had a cig since beginning of January. 
p486
aVStopped smoking cigarettes a week ago, I feel great.\u000a\u000aPicked up the juul around a week / 1.5 weeks can't remember for certain, and ever since I havent touched a single cancer stick.\u000a\u000aMy sense of smell is back, which is amazing, I can smell stuff now, food  nature, me when I'm taking a shit.\u000a\u000aSo far my lung capacity is still terrible but I know it'll improve in time. Climbing stairs is a bit easier for me but if I do it too fast I'll get tired super quickly\u000a\u000aI'm not a veteran smoker, I started last year in September because I thought to myself "Come on, I won't really get addicted!" and whoop dee doo fucker look where you're at.\u000a\u000aOverall I'm super happy, In beginning to get healthier, I'm losing weight too cause I'm on a diet and I don't crave cigs that's to the juul.
p487
aVBear in mind that the Juul is healthier than cigarettes, not healthy. You should work toward being free from the dependence on nicotine. Getting off of cigarettes is a great first step though, do congrats on that. 
p488
aV6 hours in, boy oh boy\u000a\u000aI've quit before for 3 weeks, but going to the gold this time!\u000a\u000aI'm mainly addicted to the JUUL, but for anyone unaware, it's just as real if not more real than cigarettes. \u000a\u000aMy motto when I get cravings? "This too shall pass"\u000a\u000aThe cravings are GNARLY but whatever, because each craving I overcome brings me closer to my goal 
p489
aVanyone having issues with those damn JUULs\u000a\u000aI have been off cigarettes for a couple months, but a lot of my friends will vape or use JUULs, as it\u2019s apparently popular among the youth these days. For me, cigarettes were more of a stupid choice for a college semester or two and the withdrawals, while terrible, went away after I just forced myself to stop buying packs. \u000a\u000aMy issue is that literally all of my friends vape, because they think it\u2019s cool, and my will is too weak to deny them when they offer their little mod things to me. This isn\u2019t really an issue with the extremely-low nicotine ones who do it for vape tricks or whatever, but I have this really insistent friend who pushes everyone to \u201ctake a hit of my JUUL\u201d. For anyone who doesn\u2019t know, JUULs are extremely high nicotine, made to help smokers get off of cigarettes and immediately onto a similar nicotine level. For whatever reason, non-smoker college students have decided that JUULs rock, and all have crippling nicotine addictions from them. I am weak-willed in social settings, but even using those stupid JUULs once will give me fucking withdrawals a day later, as I\u2019m experiencing right now. Do I have to get a whole-ass new group of friends? None of them want to quit and, while I want to be strong, going in the middle of a group of dudes blowing clouds seems like a ridiculously unnecessary temptation. 
p490
aVFirst things first, talk to your friend and tell him you appreciate his generosity (seriously, JUUL pods are expensive, when I used mine I def didn't share) and tell him you're staying away from nic. When you're hanging around friends, I'd consider bringing a setup with 0mg in it so you're not tempted to use their stuff. \u000a\u000aTrust me, I feel your pain. Quit vaping almost two months ago. My fiance vapes a JUUL type device and I work in the industry, so all of my co-workers vape. I can't escape it. 0mg is the only thing that gets me through. 
p491
aVYeah, im 6 hours into quitting my juul. It is a crippling addiction, can confirm. No, you just gotta stop hitting it? I thought you quit 3 months ago? 
p492
aVThat's hard. Quitting is hard. And for everyone it might be a little different.  Maybe, finding some sort of NRT like the JUUL so that when you are out with friends and they are smoking you can technically join them but just vape instead.  It does sound good that your friends are amazed that you stopped. Maybe find something you love more than smoking and remind yourself of it as much as possible.  Also the Smoke Free app has helped me ALOT.  Keep coming back to this sub. fellow quitters are always a huge help to me. It's hard, one of the hardest things I've ever done.  I'm only on day 6.
p493
aVHey! First of all, congratulations on your decision to quit. Second, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve gotten this suggestion, but I got a juul and have hardly ever picked up a cigarette (I was a pack a day, most I\u2019ll pick up a smoke now is once or twice a month socially\u2014 and can\u2019t even finish them) ever since. Highly recommend! 
p494
aVI didnt experience the waking up so often, as much as I did irritability and stuff. Honestly what helped me was just eating more, or exercising. Any type. Take long walks through nice parks, walk your dog for an hour if you have one, stop focusing on the cig! I know it\u2019s waaaay easier said than done, but remember that most often, cravings pass within a few minutes. I try to associate quitting with a positive thing in my life. For example, treat yourself to ice cream for your effort, or enjoy a nice home cooked meal, try drinking lots of water, convince yourself in your mind that you are NOT a smoker, just someone who smoked cigarettes, but now you\u2019re done with that part of your life. The toughest fight is the mental aspect. Distractions, distractions. Eventually the cravings will get smaller and fewer between, and if you keep up with exercising or eating healthier, your body will literally cringe at the thought, sight, and smell of others smoking, because you\u2019re not a smoker, just someone who tried it for some time, and realized it wasnt for you. Sleepless nights, ambient sounds helped me fall asleep (Rain, Thunderstorms, Forest sounds) whatever you like, commit to it. You got this, and you CAN do this!! 2.5 months smoke free and so fucking proud :) and worst case, a vape/juul is not the worst thing in the world to transition to a smoke free life. I juuled for the first month transitioning, and then weened myself off that. The goal is smoke free, the path does not matter. Stay strong \u2764\ufe0f\U0001f64f\U0001f3fc\U0001f919\U0001f3fc

aVJuul Habit\u000a\u000aI am very interested in juul habits, or e-cigarettes in general. I am a student seeking information to help young adults with smoking cessation. \u000a\u000aI'm curious, why do many teenagers/young adults become addicted to juuls? Do you think they know the health effects of e-cigarettes? Do you think teenagers/young adults want to quit e-cigarette use? Why is quitting so difficult? \u000a\u000aThanks everyone for your help! It is much appreciated!
p496
aVPeople can make fun all they want but the fact of the matter is that I was addicted to nicotine and chose to stop. I started with the juul in college and later got a suorin on 50mg of nic. Loved the fucking thing but it had to go
p497
aVI\u2019m not really experiencing much stress. Last night I was walking my dog up and down the boardwalk at the beach and I really considered buying a pack of cigs or a juul. The juul was 60 dollars plus another 18 for a pack of pods I was not gonna fucking do that. So I kept thinking about buying a pack of cigs, didn\u2019t wanna buy a whole pack so I was considering bumming one off a random person. I ended up doing nothing and just went to bed
p498
aVThrew my Juul away\u000a\u000aI went from socially smoking cigarettes, to vaping 24/7. Nice thing is I kicked the cigs, but then I picked up an expensive vape habit.\u000a\u000a\u000aI finally threw the whole damn thing away today. Please let this be it for me
p499
aVFor someone who smokes a pack a day (so not worried about nicotine increasing haha) would you recommend the juul for quitting? It seems really promising but is it close enough to an actual cigarette to curb the cravings?
p500
aVYeah man. The juul is super satisfying, it had a ridiculous amount of nicotine so one rip off of it strikes your throat super harshly, and then you get that buzz we all crave. Would definitely recommend, nothing comes as close as the juul to emulating cigs &amp; why we smoke cigs. If you have any questions about it pm me good luck my man.
p501
aVCool man. Mint is my favorite flavor, it\u2019s really refreshing, if you smoke menthol cigs try mint menthol, &amp; if you\u2019re trying to emulate cigs as much as possible get tobacco. Don\u2019t waste your time with the other flavors imo, definitely not made for smokers. Needless to say, vape will never perfectly emulate the feeling of a cig, but the juul has its own sort of satisfaction that is really easy to replace cigs with. I really think you can do this man. Good luck, I\u2019m rooting for you. Feel welcome to pm me your progress/what you think about the juul if you think it\u2019d help you quit. Have a good night friend.
p502
aVI quit smoking 14 days ago. Picked up a juul and have found it to be extremely helpful for quitting cigarettes. Don\u2019t think I could have gotten this far without it. Switched to a lower nicotine % today. GL :)

aVI used to smoke pack a day. Quit cold turkey with JUUL. Bought a 30 ml saltnic and refilling the pods (juul pods are expensive)

aVBuy a Juul man don\u2019t smoke those cigarettes. We\u2019re addicted to nicotine, that I can\u2019t deny. When you puff on the juul it disassociates the physical cigarette from getting your nicotine fix. You can now associate all the negatives with an actual cigarette, smells terrible, bad breath, the constant wasting of money, flipping out when you can\u2019t find a lighter, etc etc.  \u000aThe juul has made it so I don\u2019t need a cigarette anymore. And I puff this thing far less than I used to smoke cigarettes. It\u2019s a way to ween off without becoming an asshole. Because believe me I turned into a hot tempered irritable asshole every time I tried quitting in the past as well. I\u2019m only on day 7 but the juul has made putting down the cigarettes much easier.
p505
aVI just ordered a Juul! The only time that I successfully quit smoking cigarettes was when vaping. I didn\u2019t have a cigarette for two years. That\u2019s saying a lot from someone who has had a pack a day addiction for 22 years. 
p506
aVI love mine. I haven't had a cigarette for several months, although I wasn't intending to quit. The Juul phased out the habit naturally after a few weeks of doing both. I just really enjoyed the mint flavor (it turns out I don't like the flavor of tobacco at all), not smelling like ass, not having to brush my teeth and wash my hands constantly, not having to stand outside in the cold/wind/rain/heat, not having to stop at the store constantly, etc. \u000a\u000aI had purchased a brand new pack right before I stopped, which I had been keeping in my car "just in case". Yesterday, I gave the pack to a homeless man who asked if I had any cigarettes. I feel 100% lighter now that they are gone. Good luck to you!
p507
aVI know everyone here is telling you to not consume nicotine ever again and you should definitely try that no matter what. \u000a\u000aBut if for some reason that doesn't work and I'm not talking about giving up on that method of you fail a few times. I'm taking about when you fail and relapse hard on cigarettes, think about getting a vape . You would be surprised by how much of you addiction comes from the habit of smoking something and not the nicotine . \u000a\u000aI started with the 6mg nicotine for one week and then switched to 3mg nicotine for 3 weeks. After switching to vaping I found it way nicer to hit than a cigarette so if my friend ever offered me a cig again I would just be like nah I got my vape. But this past weekend I traveled out of state and forgot to take my vape. I was worried I would get withdrawals but surprisingly three days went back and no withdrawals. I started vaping 0mg nicotine now just to get the feeling of smoking. But I can sense that habit slowly dying in me.\u000a\u000aOne thing to note: please don't get the juul or any of those tiny low key vape mods that look like pencils. Do your research and get a proper mod. The flavor and the vapor buildup will make you realise how much more enjoyable it is to vape. Also investing in a proper vape will make you stop buying cigs for a while anyways.
p508
aVI quit juuling 3 days ago. First two days were VERY rough but it seems to have gotten better from there. I felt a sudden change when the nicotine completely cleared out around this morning. Cravings are rarely occurring (coming from every hour on the first day) and the withdrawals are almost gone. 
p509
aVI had to google juuling, I\u2019ve never heard of it before. They describe it as stronger than the usual ecig (I used 20mg) so fair play to you for managing 3 days so far. I had 2 patches left so I\u2019m using those to get the nicotine while I get used to not vaping. Nervous about going patch free tomorrow, but I\u2019ve wasted so much of my life on this addiction, I don\u2019t want to waste any more time and money. 
p510
aVAny suggestions on how to quit? Or what have you done that helped you quit?\u000a\u000aI turned 25 years old a few days ago and decided for my birthday I\u2019ll give myself what\u2019s left of my lungs back. I\u2019ve been smoking for 10 years (I know.... disgusting). But it\u2019s hit the point where I\u2019m just tired of it, and I honestly find the habit disgusting. I\u2019ve tried to quit several times before, and even managed to make it about a month one time but always managed to get pulled back in somehow. I notice that I have a routine and catch myself smoking at the same times everyday or after certain activities. I honestly think I might have semi OCD and over the years just got addicted to the process rather than the nicotine itself. Biggest problem is when I get bored I smoke because it\u2019s something to do.\u000a\u000aWhat have some of you done in order to quit? I tried going cold turkey, and sometimes it goes really well but I always end up failing. I was never really a vaper and found it kinda pointless, but I\u2019m still thinking about picking up a Juul. I\u2019m afraid that there will be some sort of side effects that come out of it since vaping is still rarely new and there isn\u2019t much research on it, but idk. I just don\u2019t want to drop one habit, pick up another then have to try to quit vaping. Any suggestions?\u000a\u000aTLDR: I need suggestions on how to quit. And what have you done that worked for you? Thought about getting a Juul but idk how I feel about picking up on bad habit to drop another. Especially one that isn\u2019t researched that well.
p511
aVSo you took vaping up as a cigarette replacement and have now been able to quit vaping? Nice! \u000a\u000aWould you happen to have any suggestions for a vape? I don\u2019t really know much about them. The only ones I\u2019m really familiar with are Juuls. They just seem like a lot less work then your standard vape that requires you to carry liquid with you every where you go. 
p512
aVHey! Congrats on trying to quit and get off it. Only if you have already purchased a Juul but there are some non nicotine pods you can use to help taper off the addicition. The store is at [https://cyclonepods.com](https://cyclonepods.com/). Best of luck on quitting! 
p513
aVTrying like hell to quit\u000a\u000aI really want to quit cigarettes. I have smoked for about 17 years. I quit from 2009-2016. But this time is much harder given co workers smoking and habit of my smoking in the car. It\u2019s starting to drag me down and give me some trouble breathing at times and affecting my overall endurance or lack thereof. When I told my co workers that I was thinking of quitting one made fun of me. So there\u2019s peer pressure too. But I really would like to stop. As much as I enjoy the act of smoking it\u2019s starting to affect my health and I can\u2019t do it any more. A couple of my co workers use a Juul. I have tried vaping before but didn\u2019t really care for it. Maybe I didn\u2019t have the right juice or something and plus I had a Smok stick which was a little bulky and leaked. I like something streamlined. The juul is really small but I don\u2019t like the pods design I prefer being able to pick what strength of juice I use. So I may hit up a vape shop and look around again. But ultimately I\u2019d like to be free of this. I use nicotine gum but again i still want a cigarette. I\u2019ve tried Chantix and it gave me terrible headaches and made me feel weird. The way I quit before was to smoke Marlboro ultra lights and just told myself that I would not pick up another one and it worked somehow and I stayed quit for 7 years. So it can be done I just wish I knew how.
p514
aVTrying to quit Juuling, 26 hours!\u000a\u000aHey guys, I know it's not smoking per se, but I got addicted to juuling. I've been going through a pod a day and it's starting to become too much money and I feel my blood pressure increasing over time. On top of that I seem to get too high blood sugar, when before I didn't. \u000a\u000aBecause of this I decided 26 hours ago to quit. It's been pretty rough so far and I was wondering if you guys have any tips. I suffer from anxiety and depression (which is why I started juuling, self medication). It's been quite a bit heightened so far. Also I've gotten a few really strong cravings that almost made me budge. \u000a\u000aI've been reading a lot of articles, and apparently the worse is 3 days in. What should I expect on the 3rd day? It falls right on a Monday so that's gonna suck, because I'm used to juuling during my lunch break.
p515
aVYou've made a smart decision. There are many forms of nicotine addiction and Juul gives you a lot of nicotine.\u000a\u000aAfter 72 hours, your body will be free of nicotine and the most intense part of physical withdrawal with be in the past. Hang in there. \u000a\u000aThese daily quit smoking lessons from Joel Spitzer really helped me. http://whyquit.com/joel/dayone.htm#dqlg
p516
aVI'm at almost 2 months now using the juul. I don't think any nicotine replacement should be frowned upon because I feel so much better now than when I was smoking. In fact, my nicotine use probably went up from what it was when I first started using the juul, but the fact that you aren't inhaling tar makes all the difference. Be proud of yourself however you manage to quit. Of course ending nicotine use altogether is the ultimate goal, but focus on one problem at a time; smoking first. Keep it up!
p517
aVYeah, I\u2019m not entirely certain how the nicotine mg stuff works yet. To my understanding at least, I have an enclosed system similar to a juul that is like 4.5% nicotine per pod, which is a whole hell of a lot. I\u2019m still trying to use this thing sparingly, but the cravings have gotten pretty intense recently. After I make my way through the remaining pods I have, I think I\u2019m going to look into getting a device where I can control nicotine content and wean myself down (this particular device only has pods at 4.5% nicotine).\u000a\u000aBut congrats to you for going as long as you have without analog cigarettes! I\u2019m heading into day 2 and I\u2019m feeling better than ever (minus some typical aches and pain type stuff, haha)
p518
aVWorks for some but not all, good on you for having that willpower and a healthy mindset to do so! Have you ever tried a vape? The juuls at several gas stations have helped many kick the habit of cigarettes. It gets expensive though so it\u2019s meant for short term In my opinion 
p519
aVFour days in: A couple of ideas for those attempting and struggling\u000a\u000aFirst off, not everything that works for somebody else will work for you.  That's important going in, but something might help somebody.  \u000a\u000a\u000aI have smoked between a half pack and a full pack for the past 12 years.  I have tried cold turkey (fuck that noise), the patch (almost equally unsatisfying), the gum (better, but not enough and made my breath worse than cigarettes), and heavy, giant\u005c-ass vapes that leaked in my pocket, my car and all over my counter one night.  They were how I quit for the longest duration (a month), but ultimately frustrated me more than satisfied me.  \u000a\u000a  \u000aWhat is working for me this time\u000a\u000a* A friend recommended and let me try his Juul device.  Like a vape, but without all of the hassle.  No leaking, no maintenance, no coil changes; no effort is required other than changing out the cartridge whenever it runs out of fluid.   I bought two of them: one for my house and one for my car; one to be charged when the other dies; one to be there when I can't find the other; one to get rid of my excuses when the other gives them to me.  I recommend the mint flavor, but I am going to try the traditional flavor next time I start running low.  The creme brulee was a mistake (and why the hell don't they sell a variety pack?).\u000a* The best idea I had this time around: I still have one cigarette per day.  Somehow, knowing that I have it to use whenever I want makes not smoking all the other times less mentally disastrous.  Even when I don't need it, I take that one each day either from fear of what may come if I don't or because I can without it being the end of the world.  Some may say this is cheating and I still haven't quit.  To them, I say, yeah, you're probably right.  But one Big Mac has to be better than ten.  (Somebody PLEASE tell me if this is no better for me than smoking like I was before or if you have scientific studies on it).  \u000a\u000aLong story short, I don't have the answers.  I know I am only four days in (if you could even say that with my one freebie), and it's a long road which I've been down before.  That being said, I know those things have been really helpful for me, and hopefully, they can help somebody else at the very least get started on their journey.  \u000a\u000aCheers.  
p520
aVJuul has quite a lot more nicotine than cigarettes, so you may be digging yourself deeper into addiction, rather than quitting.
p521
aVBest of luck to you. I've tried to give myself the same loophole in the past and all I did was obsess about that one cig everyday. But, maybe the Juul +1 plan will work out for you. \u000a\u000aAs the saying goes, "Every man must get to heaven his own way."
p522
aVI haven\u2019t had any problems with it so far. It seems the community is rather strongly opposed to the Juul in any way, but if it gets the tobacco out of my lungs, that\u2019s a pretty good start. 
p523
aVGotcha. You didn\u2019t distinguish between cancer and heart disease risks. \u000a\u000aAnd PS - I see nothing wrong with the Juul. Whatever works for you.
p524
aVI see. Most of the people who come here are looking for support to quit all forms of nicotine addition. Some come because they are addicted to Juul and want to quit. 
p525
aVIt's not a matter of being strongly oppose to Juul. This is a stop smoking community. To be frank, I don't know what you're trying to achieve. Are you trying to switch from cigarettes to vaping? Because that's a completely different subreddit than quitting smoking. 
p526
aVm00n- I'm stopping today as well. I am 20, I've been juuling for 2 years, and it stops now. Hold me accountable, I'll hold you accountable. Let's take it one day at a time. I'm feeling my first withdrawl as I write this!
p527
aV531 day cigarette free - got hooked on nicotine thru vaporizer in the last two months - quitting today!\u000a\u000aIt's been almost 1.5 years since I quit smoking cigarettes and everything has been great. About two months ago I started smoking JUUL (an e-cigarette with really high nicotine content), and I'm addicted to it for sure. I\u2019ve been in a state of ignoring my problem by justifying the fact that e-cigs are less unhealthy than regular cigs. Truth is I don't want to be a smoker of any kind. Today I decided to quit JUUL cold turkey the same way I quit cigarettes in the first place. Wish me luck guys! 
p528
aVGood luck. I hope you conquer your addiction.  Why did you start using the JUUL after being free for so long? I don't know anything about ecigs or vapes of any kind. 
p529
aVYesterday was day 1 of no juul for me 
p530
aVOne month ago I would have told you that I had accepted I would die from lung cancer because there is no way I could ever quit. But 4 days ago I had this weird aha moment mid-cig and quit at noon that day without any prior planning. It has been a lot easier than previous attempts to quit for some reason. Using Juul ecig (Godsend) and Nicorette gum to manage cravings. Longest I\u2019ve been without a cig in 10+ years. Feeling optimistic :)
p531
aVCan't believe I finally quit\u000a\u000a Being a heavy smoker for the last 10\u005c-11 years, I've been trying to quit for the last year or so. Patches, gum and all of that just didn't work for me. Vaping appeared to be the only solution, but it isn't really my thing too. It feels more like smoking hookah than cigs. It also didn't satisfy my cravings at all. I've tried a couple vaping setups and was using it occasionally until my brother introduced me to STLTH Vape.  \u000a\u000a\u000aI liked it from the first puff. It feels good in the hand. It draws nicely. It gives me a great throat kick I was looking for, and the most important thing \u005c- it\u2019s easy to use.  \u000a\u000a\u000aYes I know, it is so\u005c-called "nonrefillable closed system device" that many vapers dislike. I am a lazy person, so I don\u2019t mind spending the extra dollars for the pods and btw it's much more affordable compared with traditional cigs or similar devices like Juul for instance. Anyways, I didn\u2019t like to deal with the hustle of building and mixing and filling up the more complex vaping systems I tried before, that's just not my thing. All I wanted is a decent cig alternative.  \u000a\u000a\u000aI've been using STLTH for the last 4\u005c-5 weeks now and it entirely replaced my smoking habit by week 3. Never been happier! I don't think i will go back to cigs, they started to disgust me..
p532
aVYes, I bought the Juul and think it really helps so far. I totally plan to wean off of this as well.
p533
aVQuitting vaping symptoms: Day 4\u000a\u000aNot sure if wrong place, but I\u2019m new to sub and wanted to share experience. I started vaping for a year after I quit smoking (8yrs smoking). Long story short, I was fond of the Boulder Rock and Juul, going through a pod a day or more.\u000a\u000aAfter a year of what I personally would consider heavy chain vaping, I was tired with the tightness in my chest and the weird lung burn sensation, as well as the CONSTANT need to rip the Juul and feeling of helplessness without it.\u000a\u000aI am on Day 4 and things have gotten pretty rough. I have quit smoking before, but I have been experiencing what I could only describe as deep, throbbing neck pains, that often extend all around and throughout my head with strong pain behind the eyes. This pain feels hollow and somewhat like a hangover, or like a dehydration headache (which it isn\u2019t).\u000a\u000a Additionally, and part of the reason I quit, is due to the fact that I would sometimes get blurred vision, after vaping. This is what scared me the most, as I have always had 20/15 vision. I still experience this since I quit and wonder if this is a common occurrence or if it will go away or if this is just me now. I am very sensitive to light and wonder if it is a symptomatic migraine/ocular migraine.\u000a\u000aAt night I will experience rage unlike anything I have experienced before. It is like a tantrum that boils right underneath the surface, that I have to type or write through to address and keep at bay. It is not a concern past the discomfort and sleeplessness it brings me, but I haven\u2019t experienced this in past times of quitting. BUT I have never quit vaping before, and I tend to believe I took a lot more nicotine vaping than I ever did smoking, and attribute this rage to the NEED for nicotine at this point.\u000a\u000aMy family and friends are supportive, I am trying to workout to combat these symptoms with endorphins, and I am slowly cleaning up my diet to overall promote a sense of wellness.\u000a\u000aMy question for the sub is, do any or all of these symptoms seem normal? Did I just truly start chiefing nicotine at levels I never have before so the fall is harder? Should Day 4 and onward get worse symptomatically? First few days were fine. Thank you in advance, and good luck! 
p534
aVWas primarily using the 5% pods for Juul, the only size/amount available at my worst vaping through one pod a day. For perspective I was at worst a half pack a day smoker when I smoked. I\u2019m no math guy, so I don\u2019t know the difference. I\u2019m going to give it a couple more days then start to worry if symptoms don\u2019t subside.
p535
aVYou might be allergic to PG or VG? Idk how a juul works but if it uses coils you may be allergic to Kanthal or whatever metal it uses. Besides that I can\u2019t think of what else would be the issue barring underlying stuff that just get triggered by vaping.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m also not a doctor 
p536
aVYou're vaping from the Juul which contains nicotine salts, which is a far more potent form of nicotine.\u000a\u000aI would look up nicotine salt withdrawal, half the people I see smoking those things use it for the head buzz, which I find ridiculous but seems to be the new fad in my area.
p537
aVOne Juul pod is equivalent to one pack of cigarettes. Juul juice is 59mg nic. So yes, your withdrawal would suck the first three days until the nic is out of your system. Now you\u2019re battling the mental habit stage. Isn\u2019t it fun? Lol. It\u2019s so worth it, though. It\u2019ll get better. Hang in there. Proud of you.
p538
aVJuul\u000a\u000aWhat do you guys think about the juul? I bought one a week ago and haven\u2019t smoked a cigarette since. I feel great! But wondering if I should make my end goal just not needing to smoke anything.. even if it\u2019s just a small vape.
p539
aVJUULS are great, I have one too. However I am wanting to get a Sourin only because you can buy different juices for the Sourin with a lower Nic content 
p540
aVThe problem I see with the JUUL is that there isn't a way to change the nicotine level in the vape. No denying it's better for you than cigarettes, but it's still a nicotine addiction, and I seriously doubt that breathing anything other than air into your lungs on a regular basis is harmless. We just have no idea what the long term effects are of vaping yet.\u000a\u000aI think that vaping is a legitimate way to quit smoking, but I'd recommend looking into a form of vape that offers control over how much nicotine you get.
p541
aV48 Hours In - From a Vaper\u000a\u000aI've spent the past year of my life vaping *(still counts as smoking, I know)* 27 mg/ml cartridges almost daily. I buy them in 2 packs and smoke one each day, it has become a bad habit. Think of a Juul, but less nicotine content. Monday morning, I decided that I was going to quit. I threw away all of the batteries, chargers, and cartridges that I own.\u000a\u000aIt has been 48 hours since I quit and I am miserable. Between the weird sleeping, being either really hungry / not hungry at all, anxiety, depression, shaking, it has been hard. I am determined to quit and I **promise** that I will not go buy another battery or cartridge. I'm wondering when it will get better. I feel like minutes have become hours and time is at a crawl. I've been running daily and smoking pot at night to help the time pass. Your support is greatly appreciated. I just want my life back without relying on a cartridge day and night.
p542
aVCongrats! How long did it take you to quit the e-cig? I\u2019ve had my juul almost 2 months and to be honest I smoke it more than I ever smoked cigs, However I can count on 1 hand how many cigarettes I\u2019ve had since the switch but want to know your journey. 
p543
aVI was using the juul, too. I got my juul in December of last year after being unable to quit cigarettes cold turkey. I stupidly thought that it was going to help since \u201ceveryone uses it.\u201d I was going through two pods a day. For comparison, I used to smoke a pack or two of cigarettes a day.  I would juul from sun up to sun down. I honestly think it was terrible for me to ever purchase it. That\u2019s how I realized what a monster nicotine is. This week of quitting has shown me how badly smoking was hurting me. My sinuses have been absolutely killing me and I have near-constant headaches. I recommend trying to quit if you can. If you need a friend or any tips, feel free to PM me. I\u2019m going through the same thing. 
p544
aVThis will be the last "attempt", because I'm going to do it this time. 30 hours without a cigarette.\u000a\u000aCurrently using a Juul, and after I'm done with butts, I'm going to get a different vaporizer that I can use 3mg, and eventually 0mg juices in.\u000a\u000aI'm 25 and I've been smoking for 8 years now. \u000a\u000aBoth my parents smoke, and my dad is currently in end stage COPD, confined to oxygen machines 24/7.\u000a\u000aI love my dad, but at the same time I am so angry at him. I won't let him know how angry I am, because I need to be there for him. But I'll be damned if I'm going to put my future kids and SO through that. I don't want my kid(s) to ever feel the way that I do right now, helpless and losing your best friend (my father).\u000a\u000aI hate cigarettes more than anything right now, as I watch my dad waste away.\u000a\u000aThis has pushed me to stop. For real. No half assing it this time.\u000a\u000aI'm done.
p545
aVCravings\u000a\u000aDamn this is really hard I cold turkey es 3 days ago after being a pod a day Juuler. Does anyone have some tips on how to get the cravings away?
p546
aVA Juul
p547
aVGood for you! I went from cigarettes to a juul to a little refillable sourin air. I\u2019m going to start cutting out nic as soon as the current bottle of juice I have is empty. I\u2019m pretty excited to give it a try
p548
aVCongrats. The benefits you mentioned are awesome! I'm only 12 days of smoke free and i can feel the gain. \u000a\u000aBut i am feeling really empty. I dont use anything. I just cold turkey and dont use any nic product. Do you recommend me Juul? I will not going to smoke a cig for sure but i want that 'throat hit' . 
p549
aVYou got this! I spent 6 months addicted to the Juul. I got a positive pregnancy test and they immediately went into the electronics recycling bin (hopefully that was the right place to dispose of it). It\u2019s been 4 weeks nicotine free (9.5w pregnant)! Apparently the only time I can quit is when I\u2019m pregnant, but this is my last pregnancy, so I really have to make this the final goodbye. Stay strong, my friend!
p550
aVThis is awesome to see - congrats! I just quit about a month ago and my Juul has been incredible for cravings (not to mention how deliciously minty it tastes in comparison to a nasty cigarette). I\u2019m still in the process of weaning myself off of this - but you\u2019re giving me hope that I\u2019ll be able to do it soon. Keep up the progress :)
p551
aVNo nic at all?  Don\u2019t juul whatever ya do lol
p552
aVAlmost 24 hours. YAY ME! But, using the Juul to get me through has me feeling guilty..\u000a\u000aI feel like I am cheating.  I really havent wanted a cig today so that's good, thanks to Juul.  However, I feel like i am cheating but I also know I wouldn't have made this long without it.  
p553
aVYou're still addicted to nicotine, but you aren't getting all of the other, burning leaves, downsides. I'm not a fan of the JUUL because you can adjust the nicotine you're receiving to help work your way down, but it's better than smoking. Small wins. 
p554
aVJust quit vaping also, my juul broke and i was going to just buy another kit since it usually  was only $20, however when i went to the gas ststion to buy another it ended up being $50... i just said screw that i think its time to quit and now im here 4 days later. Still kind of feeling crappy however i'm still going strong. I could have bought some cigs, but i REALLY did not feel like withdrawing from those again too..Keep up the good work man
p555
aV4 Days in and this is the first time I'm certain I can quit forever. Problem is I feel like I'm cheating...\u000a\u000a10 year former smoker here. I've tried to quit in a serious way 4 times, but in the back of my mind I always knew I hadn't smoked my last cigarette. No matter how much I hated my habit. The thing I loathe the most about smoking is waking up to my stinky cigarette hand next to my face on my pillow after a long night of drinking. Absolutely the most disgusting thing on this planet. Drinking has always been my downfall with cigarettes. I lose all sense of willpower, and wake up with a horrible nicotine hangover every time. \u000a\u000aI tried to quit cold turkey and lasted about a month and before I began sneaking cigs on my nights out. I tried the patch because I heard it would put so much nicotine in my system that smoking would make me sick. It just gave me panic attacks and heart palpitations. I tried gum. I hated the spicy burn it had, and I often still wanted a cigarette an hour later when the gum buzz wore off. I tried vaping and it was expensive, leaky, dorky looking, a pain in the ass to keep charged, and just didn't give me that back of the throat hit I craved. Often I would find myself more addicted to nicotine than with my usual smoking habit, and went back to my American spirits with a furious apatite, smoking twice what I used to for a month or so.\u000a\u000aThe thing that finally changed for me, and it feels like cheating, is I found something I like even more than cigarettes. Something even more addictive and satisfying, and it scares me a little. I got a Juul.\u000a\u000aIt hits the back of my throat and my brain in a way no other vape ever has. In a way only that first smoke of the day can. Two hits and I'm swimming in an instant delicious nicotine head rush. It charges so fast (under an hour), doesn't have a bunch of parts to maintain, and warns me when it's running low on battery so it doesn't crap out on me at the bar. The battery lasts exactly as long as one pod so it takes the most minimal effort to keep it running. It hits perfectly every time and tastes amazing. I can use it almost anywhere because it is so small and discrete and the smell doesn't hang in the air. I don't feel self conscious using it in public. And it might be cheaper than my smoking habit, though we'll see. I'm obsessed with this thing. But I also feel like it has me hooked on nicotine on a whole new level. And I'm a little scared. It only took me 3 days to go through a pod, and one pod is supposed to be equivalent to a whole pack of cigarettes. I was rarely more than a pack a week smoker, unless I was having a serious party weekend, and most of those were bummed out to friends. I find myself wanting to hit it all the time. But I haven't wanted a cigarette even once. Not last night when I was drinking red wine with a bunch of my smoker roommates on the porch. Not this morning with my cup of coffee. Not after the big greasy burger I had for lunch. Not during my long drive home from work. Not while I was doing my homework on a heavy dose of Adderall. Not when I was feeling kinda gassy crampy and constipated and needed a little help taking a nice big shit. My Juul has me covered. I love it. I love it so much it worries me. They don't make lower concentration pods, and they definitely don't make nicotine free pods. Their juice contains nicotine salts instead of freebase nicotine like most e liquids, and this shit is like crack. Whoever created Juul knows what they are doing. I am subscribed to their monthly delivery of pods and completely beholden to them. But at least I'm not smoking. So long as I have this thing in my pocket, I know I won't ever smoke another cigarette again. I've never felt this certain I was done in my life. I guess I should be happy, but moving on to what feels like a much stronger addiction was not what I had in mind...
p556
aVIt's got to be at least a little better than smoking though right? It's gonna be a lot harder to quit this thing than cigarettes, and I've already sunk so much money into it. I think for now I'm just going to enjoy being a non smoker and hope I can taper my Juul habit into something a little healthier and more affordable over time.
p557
aVDefinitely get off the nicotine ASAP, some people have tried using these non nicotine pods to help quit. Good flavor and totally work with Juul. The store is at r/https://cyclonepods.com. Best of luck
p558
aVBeen 3 days since I stopped being a salve to nicotine\u000a\u000aWhat makes it hard is that I have no support around me. I was a closet nicotine addict, I started with dip and then used cigs in college. I decided to buy a Juul towards the end of of the semester so that when I went home I could conceal my habit better from my parents. \u000a\u000aI had about a pack a day habit, and I have called it quits 3 days ago. I feel in pain, I have been getting  angry at my mom for no reason and I get agitated easily. I feel as though I'm going about this alone and it is making it so hard for me. Nobody understands that I am having trouble sleeping, have a weird feeling in my head, and crave nicotine soooo much.\u000a\u000aI know it's the devil, but life with the devil in it seems like it was better then this :(
p559
aVplease help me\u000a\u000ai took two hits of my vape(juul) after quitting for 4 weeks and feel like withdrawl is happening again. is this possible? what do i do? 
p560
aVI know this isn\u2019t a vape forum but a lot of cigarette smokers I know quit thanks to vaping. A lot of them like the Juul cause it gives a throat hit like cigs and a very strong buzz. Try it out, life is too short for tar in the lungs
p561
aVHey, we have some non nicotine Juul compatible pods that you may be interested in. These pods can probably help with that. The store is at [https://cyclonepods.com/](https://cyclonepods.com/). Best of luck!
p562
aVOne week in\u000a\u000aLong time lurker. Posting partially to hold myself accountable. Week was pretty easy to be honest. Got a gym membership to keep me busy. But today after work I was craving a nic fix pretty bad. I knew I didn\u2019t want to smoke, just wanted the fix. Broke down and bought a Juul. Hit it twice and the craving passed. Room mate still smokes and he\u2019s out of town. He left a pack on the coffee table and I can honestly say I have zero desire to steal one and they\u2019re just sitting in front of me. Tried my best not to break down and buy a vape. But anything\u2019s better than smoking. Honestly happy with the decision at this point. Next step is ditching this thing and I know that, but for now I\u2019m just glad I\u2019m not smoking tobacco. I can still count this as one week, right? \u000a\u000aA little background, I started smoking tobacco with bong rips about 4 years ago with the occasional spliff. Finally got the guts to toss all of my glass this past August, it had gotten to the point where I was ripping straight tobacco bowls a few times daily. Tossing my glass felt like a big step in itself. Since then I\u2019ve been smoking significantly more spliffs. And recently when I started sneaking cigarettes more and more I knew I was at a crossroads. Last week I let myself smoke as many spliffs as I wanted. Let myself feel the tightness it caused in my chest and the strain on my lungs. Then last Friday, I knew that needed to be it. Since then I\u2019ve felt a significant cognitive shift towards smoking cigarettes. I smell it on the streets and want nothing to do with it. I see it on tv and pity the actors smoking. I think I\u2019m on the right path, and in the grand scheme of things, I\u2019m okay vaping for a little while if it means in the long run I can kick this shit. \u000a\u000aKind of a rant, but hey, this is the place for it. \u000a\u000aPower on compadres.
p563
aVThe juul helped me quit. Over 5 months without a cigarette from a pack a day for years. Be strong. 
p564
aVVaping is better than smoking. I'm not a fan of the JUUL because they're good in nicotine and you have no control over the level in them. Maybe consider a regular vape with juice you can control. Either way, hang in there, you can do it. 
p565
aVTrying to quit\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve never smoked cigarettes but I do about the equivalent to a pack a day with my juul (~1 pod a day). I always told myself I could quit whenever. Well...I lost my juul the other day and haven\u2019t had a way to get a new one and it\u2019s been the worst 36 hours of my life. I\u2019m so so angry. I am getting weird twitches. Having panic attacks. I decided to drink last night to cope and that was a bad idea because now I\u2019m hung over. But honestly something with this much control over my life shouldn\u2019t be something I do for fun. I want to quit but this is kinda fucking hard. Any advice? How long will it be this bad? Tapering advice?
p566
aVlol wot "juuls 4 tots"\u000a \u000athat shit is fucked up. You should focus on selling to people in countries that have banned vaping or E-juice/nicotine.\u000a \u000aBtw if anyone wanted to find you I bet you didn't have the foresight to obscure your IP when you posted here to Reddit so I'd do yourself a favor and delete this since it's obvious you didn't find this trash .onion link randomly and decided to post here lol \u000a \u000aDouble btw: Your shit tier HTML page is using Google Analytics, why? lmao did your Intro to Web Design prof make you like your first pages to it?\u000a \u000aSPAMMING THIS ON ALL YOUR POSTS AND ILL BUILD A BOT TO DO IT IF YOU DONT DELETE THIS ACCOUNT AND POSTS.
p567
aVHonestly that's a good point. I've been smoking cigarettes for a couple of months, but I was juuling before that. Should I just return the vape? The thought of being over this so soon is very appealing. 
p568
aVSo you've been using a Juul too? That makes a difference, I assumed you were just smoking cigarettes only. Depending on how long and how often you've been using the Juul, it could be worse. I'd recommend that you try to get off of nicotine completely. You can use gum or patches, but you really need to just get off of it all together and claim your life back. The longer you avoid quitting, the worse the quit will get.\u000a\u000aOne way or another, just make yourself a promise that you will never smoke another cigarette. It isn't cool to be addicted to nicotine, but getting nicotine from a Juul or vape is \u005c*\u005c*way\u005c*\u005c* better than smoking cigarettes. Vape may or may not cause you issues down the road, but anyone who has smoked and vaped can tell you that vape isn't even in the same league as smoking when it comes to "bad for you".
p569
aVI've only been Juuling since January, so maybe the quit won't be too bad still. I don't juul in addition to smoking; it's always been one or the other and I haven't juuled since I started smoking. I think I'm going to return the vape tomorrow and just go cold turkey. The longer I go, absolutely the worse it will be. Congrats on 48 days by the way, that's incredible, and thanks for the advice. 
p570
aVI quit 2 weeks ago, and I\u2019ve been using a Juul to help with cravings. Juul liquid is 5%, but it\u2019s fairly concentrated and gives a nice buzz. Since I still have access to nicotine, I still don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve completely \u201cquit\u201d  the addiction yet. I\u2019m going to start weaning myself off in about a month or so. However it\u2019s been helping me quite a bit. Best of luck :) 
p571
aVDecided on the patch/gum to see how it goes first, if it doesn't make me quit I might try a vape and I'll keep Juul in mind thanks a lot.
p572
aVI\u2019m almost three days in. I hit one of those fucking JUUL pods, 1 hit because the temptation was killing me. From that one hit I got a little buzz. And now, I hate myself. Did that stupid hit completely fuck up my journey. I am extremely disappointed in myself. This stupid nicotine monster inside me is unreal. So strong and so tempting.\u000a
p573
aVDon\u2019t do it. Get a vape or a juul\u000aYour mind is playing tricks on you! \u000aTwo days=your body is almost free of the toxins/nicotine 
p574
aVIsn't the vape or juul (I'm assuming you mean the disposable ones at the gas station) isn't that just as bad?
p575
aVHey there from the States! I started smoking (what some Americans refer to as) moles when I was seventeen. Started slow and before I knew it I was smoking 10+ a day. Trying to skip out of work just to sit in my room and mole. I quit three months ago shorty after turning twenty two. Black spirits is all I used. I was and still am very ashamed that I even got myself into it. Here is what I used to quit tobacco. \u000a\u000a1. You have to want it. You really have to want to quit. I use a Juul for now and I'll get to that in a second but nothing will replace the feeling. Just know it will get better. \u000a\u000a\u000a2. Find someone who also wants to quit. I quit with my friends and I think that played a huge role. \u000a\u000a\u000a3. Find a vape for now that will help will the nicotine withdraw. Don't listen to people who say it's harmful it is 1000x better than cigs. And it will be much easier to quit a vape. \u000a\u000a\u000a4. Do not give up no matter what. If you fail, start again and again until you succeed. And believe me if I did it and all of my friend's did, I promise you can too.

aVSmoke "free" for over a month, I remember why I liked cigarettes\u000a\u000aI switched to the Juul a little over a month ago. Since then, I haven't bought a pack, but I **have** smoked a couple of cigarettes, namely when I went out with friends and they had cigs and offered me. I never really intended to quit smoking, I just intended to quit regularly smoking, but not mind the occasional cigarette, like some of my friends are.\u000a\u000aHowever, today I've been really missing cigarettes. I surfed /r/cigarettes for a bit and looking at all the different brands and blends brought back to me why I liked smoking: I enjoy it. Not to mention, I've been feeling slightly *off* for the past few days (not making excuses here, but I am diagnosed with bipolar, so while I've been stable for a while, I think the stress of the end of the semester is starting to trigger some things in me), with the addition of finals stress, and it's these ingredients that led me to smoke in the first place.\u000a\u000aKinda just venting here, I guess.
p578
aVWorst Feeling in the world\u000a\u000aBeen addicted to nicotine for about 2 years now (Started when i was 15).  Never smoked a cig but using the Juul and other ecigs.  I came clean to my mom and said I need help.  We talked and im starting Nicolette gum tomorrow.  The worst feeling in the world is thinking about my mom buying that Nicolette gum at the store and how she must\u2019ve felt.  I feel like such a disappointment but I hope I can make them proud by quitting.  I don\u2019t think kids realize how bad having and using a juul really is.  I\u2019ve cried almost every night for the past week because I think about when I didn\u2019t need nic to have a good time and when I didn\u2019t always think about it.  Wish me luck.  
p579
aVI am ALSO on day 4 cold turkey! \u000a\u000aSo nice to know someone is on my similar path. I went from splifs--&gt;cigarrettes--&gt;juul (e-cig) and I am emotionally done with this shit. Keep up the good work. 
p580
aVCanker sores\u000a\u000aHey everyone, I\u2019ve been smoking since I was 19 (I\u2019ll be 22 in less than a month) and I\u2019m finally ready to call it quits. I got myself a juul (even though coincidentally it was actually vapes that led to cigarettes in my case) and cut out the cigs. I don\u2019t have any cravings for cigarettes so that\u2019s good. HOWEVER THESE FUCKING CANKER SORES ARE KILLING ME. I just got my first round of canker sores but from previous experience with going days without cigarettes, I know there will be more immediately after these ones go away. How long can I expect to have to deal with these reoccurring canker sores until they finally stop coming back? Because honestly, cigarettes are better than having to deal with the constant pain of multiple canker sores. But I\u2019m willing to power through it. So how long until my body recalibrates and I stop getting canker sores? 1 week? 4 weeks? 6 months? Or am I in this for life?? 
p581
aVThe JUUL is keeping the stress away. I\u2019ve read that it has to do with your mouth becoming more acidic after quitting cigarettes. Do you still get them regularly?
p582
aVNice, I don't know much about JUUL, does it help with tapering? \u000a\u000aThat makes sense I guess. I only get them if I'm super stressed or I have more than like 4 alcoholic drinks in a week. 
p583
aVStress definitely causes canker sores for sure, I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s the reason I\u2019m getting them at the moment. JUUL is just an e cig, it helps because of the nicotine 
p584
aVTomorrow is finally the day\u000a\u000aI\u2019m mostly posting this for myself to reflect on, but after 15 years of smoking the day has finally come. I\u2019ve been cig free for 2 weeks today, but have been using a vape and a Juul to get my nic fix. I bought the gum and wanted to ween off but I think I\u2019d rather just rip the bandaid off now instead of getting addicted to gum. Fortunately I will be working from home over the next 2 weeks which should help the irritability associated with nic withdrawals. I do have some 0 nic vape juice and I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m okay to use that, or if it will make me want to smoke more. I feel like I\u2019m already anxious about getting a \u201ccold turkey flu\u201d. This community has helped me a lot in coming to this decision, and whatever happens thank you all!
p585
aVYup same here. I started smoking cigarettes when I wasn\u2019t getting the buzz from vaping anymore. It didn\u2019t help that vapes are unreliable and always break whereas cigarettes don\u2019t. I recently quit cigs and now I\u2019m weening off the nicotine addiction with a Juul. But if I could go back in time and beat my own ass for buying that first vape, I would.
p586
aVThe Juul is the only thing that's made me actually successful in quitting in the past over 10 years. Besides a stupid 1 day, 2 cig, relapse.
p587
aVHello! I'm a college student very addicted to Juul, and who desperately wants to quit.\u000a\u000aThe start of the addiction-\u000aIt all started when a friend gave me a Juul earlier last semester. I vaped 3nic juice for about a year before that, and was never addicted. I dipped all summer Junior year and never got addicted, could always go without both forms of nicotine consumption, I would always leave it at home, I could go extended days without nicotine, I never craved it.\u000a\u000a\u000aBut the Juul, the fucking Juul. It turned me from buying one 30ml, 3 nic strength juice a month, to spending $35 a week to feed my pod a day addiction. I cannot go quit it, without feeling intense cravings, and it is one of the worst things to ever happen to me. I was ignorant to addiction, and I am now paying the price. \u000a\u000aI ran out of money the first semester for pods, and bought a pack of cigs because I hate them, and thought that maybe would be enough to quit. Not a surprise at all, I did not feel good at all and could only smoke five a day. It lowered my nicotine intake temporarily, but I was experiencing strong withdrawals and was sleeping more then normal. School work was not getting done, and I needed to start using the Juul again. I have the equivalence of a pack a day addiction with Juul. It took a month to get there, but I have never progressed beyond a Juul pod a day.\u000a\u000aI have been delaying quitting (I know classic procrastination) but my reasoning makes sense to me. I did not want to go through peek withdrawal symptoms during school, because I knew my grades would drop and I wouldn't be as functional. My roommate and all of my friends are also addicted to Juuls so there is no escape from it at school anywhere, but at home I'm around it significantly less.\u000a\u000aThis summer I want to quit once and for all, but I want advice on the easiest way to quit without taking prescription drugs. I DO want to kick the addiction once and for all. I know I have a problem, and I want to fix it. \u000a\u000aI'm going to have two jobs this summer, and I'm afraid I'm not going to be functional at all. I was thinking about faking the flu during the first few days of withdrawals so I don't have to tell my parents, they are not understanding at all. I love my dad to death, but he is a know it all.  He would not be understanding at all, and I feel like I would not be in the mood to put up with shit, and I would want their support but that is not going to happen. While on pain pills before my dad said "I don't think I would make a good addict, I never think I would get addicted to something", yeah well pops you haven't went a day without caffeine in 15 years.\u000a\u000aTo get back on track. I am a fucking idiot, who wants to poke some fun at my lack of drug intelligence and the fact I'm actually addicted to the Juul, while maybe offering some advice?
p588
aVWhat to expect from withdrawal\u000a\u000aHi,\u000a\u000aI\u2019m currently a 20 year old male who started vaping about three years ago. Not huge nicotine concentration (6g/ml) but I was hitting it a lot. I love the sensation of inhaling and exhaling smoke. \u000a\u000aAbout 6 months ago I switched to a juul. Bad decision. It\u2019s smaller and easier to use, so I can use it more often, and the nicotine concentration is ridiculous. I think I\u2019m basically smoking a pack or a bit more per day worth of nicotine. \u000a\u000aI\u2019m in college studying biochemistry. Finals end and I go home on May 10th. I will be back in my college town however on May 20th for a research assistant internship where I\u2019ll be studying DNA damage and repair for 10 weeks. \u000a\u000aMay 10-May 20 is when I planned to quit. I know I couldn\u2019t do it during school, but I need to do it ASAP because I can\u2019t be working in a lab for 8 hours a day and trying to hit my juul here and there. I don\u2019t want to be a slave to nicotine. Another reason is that I plan to take the MCAT and go to medical school. How could I concentrate on a 7 and a half hour test if I\u2019m addicted to nicotine?\u000a\u000aAnyway, there\u2019s the background. I want to know what to expect throughout those ten days. Withdrawal symptoms, what days will be the worst, if I\u2019ll be back to functional by May 20th when I start working. I\u2019m especially afraid of the brain fog since I need to be sharp. I\u2019ve tried quitting before and only lasted a couple days, but damn that brain fog was just scary. It\u2019s like I had to think how to piece words together before I could even get a sentence out. \u000a\u000aLastly, is there anything I should do during those ten days to make it an easier process? I smoke weed here and there, I was thinking that may help. My mother has a xanax prescription for insomnia, maybe I could take some of those for sleep or if the anxiety gets too bad (don\u2019t worry though, I\u2019ll keep it easy, I\u2019m not trying to acquire a xanax addiction in the process\u201d\u000a\u000aThanks in advance for your comments!!
p589
aVOh wow we\u2019re the same! Let\u2019s cut the bullshit juul out, get them A\u2019s, fuck up the mcat, and become doctors. 
p590
aVAlthough I can't really tell you how good it is, because mine isn't going to be here until Thursday, the Juul is supposed to be a good alternative. I've never like vaping, and I want to give up nicotine for good, but I've read a lot about people switching to the Juul and then eventually putting that down too. \u000a\u000aBasically the Juul is supposed to give you a hit similar to a cigarette, in regards to feeling in your chest if you know what I mean. The only reason I mention it is because you said you were using the patches. Best of luck to you, you got this!
p591
aVI just looked 'Juul' up.  Looks interesting.  Lets us know how it works.  \u000a\u000aThanks for your support! 
p592
aVTry a juul
p593
aVShould I even be proud?\u000a\u000aMy last cigarette was on Friday morning of last week. I feel happy that in over 10 years I can say I'm almost a week cigarette free. Before this quit, I had never gone even 1 day without having a cigarette. \u000a\u000aBut, I've been using Juul. Once in the morning, after work, on my dog walks and before bed. Sometimes I'll take a puff or two at work if I'm stressed. So, does this take away from my accomplishment? Can I even say I quit smoking? Am I allowed in this group?
p594
aVThank dude, that's what I'm scared of. It's gotten to the point that the majority of the time I get a craving to use the juul I take a nap.
p595
aVhave you tried getting a juul?
p596
aV&gt; juul\u000a\u000ano, i now little about juul
p597
aVHaven't smoked cigs since new year! But can't say the same about smoking a Juul. Can't tell if I'm doing good or bad. Anyone else have similar experiences?\u000a\u000aI've been smoke free since New Years which I'm very happy about. At 25 I had been smoking for 12 years and was disgusted with myself. \u000a\u000aBeing smoke free I have used a Juul as a way of weening myself off the smokes. For one I feel a million times better and an overall happier. But my family says it's the same thing and really aren't even proud at all. Are they right? Are Juuls really that bad for you? Should I be happy with my progress or am I just cheating myself here?\u000a\u000aFuck smoking and good luck to everyone on their journeys!! 
p598
aVJuul helped me get off cigs too but it also had negative consequences after using it for too long. I was overly stimulated at times since it has 50mg of nicotine compared to a typical vape that usually has 4-12. I\u2019m happy to hear your off cigs but be careful bc the juul can easily be just as addictive.
p599
aVQuit about 100 times cold turkey. Bought a Juul last night after another failed attempt\u000a\u000aHey everyone, \u000aI\u2019ve been smoking about a pack a day for 11 years and have always hated it. In other aspects of my life\u000aI try to take good care of myself by eating right, exercising and taking care of my mental/spiritual health. \u000a\u000aSmoking should not fit in my life. I am the only person in my immediate family who smokes. I have to keep it a secret from them and it\u2019s just miserable. \u000a\u000aSo last week, I went 4 days. The first 2 were awesome actually! I read Allen Carr\u2019s book and his take on how stupid NRT is with prolonging the agony made sense to me so I took a very all or nothing approach to stopping. \u000a\u000aI also believe he hit the nail on the head with the addiction being 95 percent mental. On the 3rd day of my quit, things started to get hard. This boggles the logical side of my brain. I know that all the nicotine is out of my body. I know I don\u2019t need it. But the cravings were FUCKING INSANE. I had to lock myself in the basement to stay away from everyone I live with. I was severely depressed. At the end of the fourth day, after having an especially shitty night at work, I caved. \u000a\u000aSo I\u2019ve been hearing about the juul and decided to try it. It\u2019s amazing. I actually like it better than cigs which is almost scary.  I drank last night, which is a huge smoking trigger for me and was perfectly happy hitting this. I actually smoked my last cig in my pack and it tasted gross compared.\u000a\u000aI bought this with the plan to use it for 2 weeks and stop because I don\u2019t want to be addicted to nicotine in any form. I figured maybe if I remove all the other chemicals in cigs and get them out of my system I could deal with the nic monster separately. I don\u2019t want to make a habit out of this. \u000a\u000aMy question is:\u000aAm I in lala land thinking that getting off this will be easier than cigs? Is it the nic talking?\u000a\u000aI really like the fact that I can do this and be grossed out by cigs. I think that would help me in the long run. \u000aAs in, 5 months down the line nic free, when I\u2019m drunk at a bar and I forget how much I fucking hated smoking. That\u2019s always been my downfall in the past. \u000a\u000aBut I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to be using this long term. Anyone have experience using this as a cessation tool? 
p600
aVGood luck to you, but I don't think the JUUL is a good way to go. From what I've heard they are actually higher in nicotine than your average cigarette, which is probably why you like it more than a cigarette, and they are not adjustable in the nicotine level without some sort of hacking being done on them.\u000a\u000aIf you really want to go this route, I would suggest trying a regular vaporizer where you can control the nicotine level in the juice, and make sure you use a low enough nicotine level that you actually experience some withdrawal, with regular reduction in the nicotine level until you get to 0mg juice.
p601
aVCongratulations - you've stopped smoking! Try to keep juul under control since it might hook you up on nicotine even more than cigarettes. Good luck! 
p602
aVJuul is super addictive, ended up tossing min out the window while driving because i was way more addicted than smoking.
p603
aV&gt; From what I've heard they are actually higher in nicotine than your average cigarette\u000a\u000aDefinitely not, a light cigarette contains 6mg of nicotine. I do see your point thought, but you must understand that the juul is pretty helpful because the nicotine content is similar to that of a cigarette. All OP has to do is moderate his use of the juul. Also, not give into each craving for a smoke. Using a regular vaporizer doesn't help most people quit cigarettes because it's doesn't feel at all like a cigarette. It just feels like a portable hookah. \u000a\u000a[One simple chart](https://ecigone.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/JUUL-E-Cigarette-Review-Nicotine-Salts.png)
p604
aVI certainly hope it works for OP and anyone else who tries to use one, but if moderating your use of the delivery mechanism worked as a way to get off of nicotine, we'd all be smoke free by now. I'm sure everyone on this sub has attempted the "cutting back on smoking" method before and found out how useless that is. If the JUUL had a way to reduce the nicotine gradually, I wouldn't have an issue with it, but from what I've seen I don't hold a lot of hope. \u000a\u000aAgain, this is just my opinion and I actually hope I'm wrong and it can lead to a full quit. If nothing else, I would say that the JUUL is better than a cigarette, so at least it's something. 
p605
aV&gt; but if moderating your use of the delivery mechanism worked as a way to get off of nicotine, we'd all be smoke free by now.\u000a\u000aFew people actively moderate it though. (I know I can't explain everyone's situation based on my own, as I'm only 3 days off cigarettes) But, thanks to the juul I haven't touched a cigarette for 3 days straight, that's the longest time without one in over 10 years. I'm killing the addiction to the act of smoking, the nicotine will take more time. I guess only time will tell, but I'm planning on being able to write in a few months that I am nicotine free. \u000a\u000a&gt;  If the JUUL had a way to reduce the nicotine gradually,\u000a\u000aYes, that would be awesome. Keep in mind that juuls slogan is basically "the adult smokers alternative to cigarettes." It was just created in 2017 with the goal to give smokers an alternative nearly equal to a cigarette. That being said, it's a fairly new product and maybe they'll focus more on getting people to quit entirely. Of course, this would be a totally separate item because I doubt they'd want to lose every customer. \u000a\u000aIt's not the perfect solution, but as someone who has smoked a cigarette every day for the past 10+ years, it feels fucking amazing to have this juul. For the past 3 days I've been able to breath and run with my dog without having to stop to cough up a long every 5 minutes. Also, I don't stink! 
p606
aV&gt; but if moderating your use of the delivery mechanism worked as a way to get off of nicotine, we'd all be smoke free by now.\u000a\u000aAlso, I have to add, this reasoning is quite flawed. I have tried the "cutting back on cigarettes and eventually quit" method. That shit did not work. I was so hooked on the entire habit of smoking and the nicotine of course. Going outside and lighting up the cigarette was just as much as my addiction than the drug itself. I'd smoke an entire cigarette and eventually for down to 3 a day. I ended up just slowly adding more cigarettes until it was back to normal. \u000a\u000aWith the juul I could just take 3 or so puffs if my craving is really bad. I don't have to go outside and so my entire "ritual" that comes along with having a cigarette. I can be in my bedroom or in my living room, or at work. Basically, it's much easier to moderate puffs off of a juul than to smoke entire cigarettes and cut back when you have a whole pack in front of you. 
p607
aVUpdate: Down but not out. What I've learned\u000a\u000aNot sure if my flair has updated but here's my last [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/84lm3y/didnt_realize_i_passed_the_2_month_mark/?st=jfot804a&amp;sh=9923833e)\u000a\u000a# What's Happened\u000a\u000a1. The Juul got way to expensive for me, spending *$20* every *two* days.    \u000a\u000a2.  I bought a pack. Got halfway through and the moment the 10th one hit my mouth I may have vomited a little. \u000a\u000a3. The smell was absolutely overbearing, people at work immediately knew I fell off the wagon.\u000a\u000a4. My boss came from a family of smokers (I didn't) and let me know he was proud of going those three months without actual boges. \u000a\u000a5. Then the coughing. Started back up immediately. \u000a\u000a# What I've Learned\u000a\u000a1. You find support from people you really don't expect, support is there if you look for it. \u000a2. I've gained a few pounds since quitting, but how is being not able to breathe going to help me when I put on my running shoes\u000a3. People notice you're a smoker. Don't pretend no one will notice like I've done for years.\u000a4. Maybe the massive nicotine content in the juul just made not not want boges? Or maybe a bit of the [Garcia Effect](https://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition.php?term=Garcia+Effect)?\u000a5. You may be down, but you're never out\u000a\u000a
p608
aVSomeone mentioned the JUUL this morning and I looked it up. Apparently, they only come in one level of nicotine, the "entire pack of cigarettes in one hit" level. You should really get off of those. Yes, you are avoiding a lot of the really bad stuff that is in an analog smoke, but remember that vaping hasn't been around for that long and hasn't been fully tested yet. There's no reason to kick one bad habit and replace it with another.\u000a\u000aStick with the quit, you can do it.
p609
aVDon't think that I'm trying to put you down for using a vape, I just don't think the JUUL is a good idea. I'm vaping to keep myself sane, so I have zero issue with vaping itself. The problem with the JUUL is the fact that they appear to actually have **more** nicotine than a cigarette, and you can't vary the level in them short of just hitting it less. \u000a\u000aThe advantage to a vape like I'm using is that the level of nicotine in the juice is adjustable, all the way down to nicotine free, and the level of nicotine that I'm at is less than I was getting with cigarettes. If you're going to use NRT to wean yourself off, you have to actually be moving in the direction of less usage. I think the lozenges are probably a good idea.\u000a\u000aGood luck, and hang in there.
p610
aVAh.. I used a JUUL. Took three years of vaping it. Quit two months ago. F\u2019in hell. I still smoke if I\u2019m with certain people. This is rare though. Like once every two months. No longer an addiction. Toughest thing is figuring out what to do in place of.. f man, my belly getting big. Imma need to cut back on munchies now... 
p611
aVHas anyone successfully quit cigarettes through JUUL, then quit the JUUL itself?\u000a\u000aI recently got the JUUL and was successfully able to make the switch from smoking a pack a day with minimal cravings for cigarettes. But the reason it was so easy was because the JUUL pods have a lot of nicotine and a good throat hit similar to cigs. \u000aNow I'm completely hooked on the JUUL.\u000aHas anyone successfully made the transition through JUUL and now doesn't smoke anything at all? Any tips? Thanks
p612
aVI'm not familiar with the JUUL. Does it have varying nicotine levels? If so, gradually reduce it. \u000a\u000aPersonally, I'm vaping with 9mg juice. It isn't as strong as I'm used to with a cigarette, but it's enough to take the edge off. I'm planning to step down to 6mg, then 3mg, then 0mg. Once I'm at 0, it's all mental and I'll cut it off. Hopefully it's the right choice for me, because the only other thing I haven't tried in the past are drugs, and I'd rather not go that route if I can avoid it. 
p613
aVJuul is absolutely insane, just do some research lol. I had to toss mine.
p614
aVIt was super hard, switched to gum now i just quit the gum. Juul is stronger than actual cigarettes in my opinion.
p615
aVI smoked cigarettes for 9 years, then used a juul for about 6 months. I thought it was easier to quit after the juul as opposed to cold turkey from cigarettes
p616
aVNo the JUUL doesn't have varying nicotine but there are videos on the internet on how you can manually change it. I suggest you try it if you can't stop because I tried vaping and it didn't even come close either, but this one is made for smokers and has a really similar inhale and nic level.
p617
aVTry to remind yourself that you are quitting nicotine, not just cigarettes. I'm in the same boat and find that the best way to not end up fully hooked on the juul is all about moderation. I try to not use the juul at work. Also, you can try to not give into each craving to take puff on the juul. Maybe try every other craving, just wait it out until you get another craving. I'm only 3 days cigarette free but already feel a huge difference in my breathing. Keep it up, you can do it! 
p618
aVI'm definitely addicted to both. I'm using the juul but occasionally really miss just lighting up a cigarette and ashing, dumb shit like that. 
p619
aVI know this is an old post, but I really hope this is me. Just switched to JUUL a day ago after trying to quit cigs countless times. 
p620
aVCyclone pods are non nicotine Juul compatible pods which some people have used to help quit the Juul. Check them out at [https://cyclonepods.com/](https://cyclonepods.com/)
p621
aVDon\u2019t be a fool rip the juul\u000a\u000aQuit smoking on Easter after my buddy gave me a juul I had been smoking butts for 5 years off and on.  The juul works well.  Cold turkey seemed impossible.  Juul gave me the confidence I could do it.  3 days in.  Hope to get off the juul in 6-9 months. 
p622
aVI switched from cigarettes to a juul for a little less than half a year, the juul broke so I quit! I'm two weeks in today. Good job transitioning, I think it made it way easier for me personally   
p623
aVI am one month free. I ain\u2019t goin back\u000a\u000aSmoking for 8 years. Quit last month. Used a juul to help me. I\u2019ve never made it this far before. It gets easier day by day. Cigarettes actually smell different to me now, they smell, dare I say, disgusting.. I am embarrassed I smelled like that for all these years. \u000a\u000aWouldn\u2019t be possible if my smoking friends didn\u2019t know I was trying to quit either. But most importantly it comes down to will power. Do I have want something else to have control over me? Fuck no
p624
aVI got something similar, to taper off juul which got me off cigs but was more addictive tbh. I bought this little nicotine pouches from my local gas station they are like snus without tobacco just nicotine. They also are more effective than nicotine polys. found in gum because they are nicotine salts.
p625
aVTry nicotine pouches , they are sold at gas stations, its like snus without tobacco and its nicotine salt like a juul inside the pouch so it feels more effective but less harsh.
p626
aVUse low nicotine snus to taper off high nicotine vape(juul)?\u000a\u000a[deleted]
p627
aVI've never used juul but is there a way to fill the pods with 0 nic juice? Might make more sense than reaching out to tobacco (snus)... 
p628
aVi bought a juul. worked for me.
p629
aVJuul
p630
aVI know this community is very anti nicotine, but I'm going a bit unorthodox with my method. I've quit in the past, twice, but both were temporary quits due to circumstances with no intention of actually quitting and what they've taught me is that my nicotine crave isn't nearly as bad as my *cigarette* crave, if that makes sense. It's the habit. So I'm splitting this up into first getting the habit out of my system, and the Juul was the closest thing to that. Then I'll get the nic out, which isn't hard for me.\u000a\u000aIt's two days earlier than I set my deadline for but I finished my pack about 9 hours ago and figured, why not. \u000a\u000aSo far, the nicotine crave isn't there, obviously. But I *really* want a cigarette. The sizzle of burning tobacco, knowing when I'll toss the cigarette out and my little break ends, all that stuff. But I'm coping with the Juul and a lot of snacks. My pod is already halfway through, which is about half a pack, but at least I haven't had tar in 9 hours.
p631
aVHey man I got a juul too! Just bought it 2 days ago and I'm cig free currently.
p632
aVBeen juuling since new years eve.... love how i dont smell of cigs anymore
p633
aVHahaha the first time I saw a Juul I wondered the same thing (*why is that why sucking on a USB stick. Oh there's vape. Oh ok.*)
p634
aVJuul pods are crazy expensive. I\u2019d recommend getting a sourin drop and buying your own nic salts if you don\u2019t wanna break the bank
p635
aVTen days since i switched to juul. Ten days since ive had a smoke. Whatever its doing, is working.
p636
aV$16 for the equivalent of 4 packs. Where I live it's $8 a pack and where I'm moving it's  $17 a pack. Either way it's way cheaper the Juul route.
p637
aVim 3 months smoke free thanks to my juul. I still need the rush of nicotine just without all the awful side effects of smoking.
p638
aVWarning to smokers considering trying a juul and similar salt based nicotine devices.\u000a\u000a[deleted]
p639
aVMarch 28\u000a\u000aI set my smoking deadline for March 28th. \u000a\u000aI'm by no means quitting nicotine. The deadline is set on the day my Juul will arrive. I've quit in the past a couple of times, each stretching a month or more -- nicotine withdrawal is no problem for me, as hard as the first week can get. It's the habit of smoking, the fucking want to hold a cigarette, to roll the wheel of the bic and light one up. That's the hard part. Feeling down? Go walk and light a cigarette. Walking to school? Hold a cigarette. I'll smoke it, because I love it, and I love the nicotine rush. But it's the act that's addictive more than anything. It's the act that always brought me back, I love it and I can't deny it.\u000a\u000aMarch 28th is when I'll make the switch from cigs to a Juul. This isn't about qutting nicotine, this is about changing habits. If I can last long enough without a cigarette habit, all I need to do after is quit the nicotine -- that part I'm used to.
p640
aVVaping helped me quit smoking but im tired of being addicted, just tossed my juul and I feel liberated.\u000a\u000aVaping seeps into your life because it can be done anytime anywhere. It was also having side effects that i didnt experience from smoking such as dehydration and anxiety. Ive been addicted to nicotine for years, ive done away with cigs for good, now its vaping.  
p641
aVI just stopped using my Juul yesterday and now I'm 24 hours nicotine free. I'm a little jittery but I got a standard vaporizer that lets me vape nicotine free juice to keep myself occupied. My plan is\u005cwas to use Juul to break free from the social\u005croutine aspects first, then nicotine free vape for about a month to get clear of the nicotine addiction. 
p642
aVNot sure if I am havig nicotine withdrawals or not.\u000a\u000aHey guys,\u000a\u000aA little background to start off, I have been a mild nicotine user since my senior year of highschool (4 years ago) I started with chew, then moved to vaping, then actual cigarettes. As ass backwards as that sounds, I currently and for the past year have only been using my Juul and smoking what we call \u201cMokes\u201d(half tobacco/half weed) out of my bong. A week ago today, I lost my Juul while on a bar crawl. All seemed fine and I have stuck with my bong and not really felt a need for the Juul. Lost it on sunday, carried on as I just stated, but friday night, I began to feel light headed, I went out with my girlfriend and her father for dinner and could not eat much. The next day, I was very weak and nauseous and ended up staying in bed all day. I went to get a smoothie but that is all I have had for over 24 hours.  I would get the chills, get hot, fall asleep, and felt down right miserable. Came home that night (last night) and smoked a moke, I felt a little better but then just went to sleep and woke up a little warm but not too bad. This morning now, I am still lacking appetite but just smoked again. Any recommendations or observations that could help me with feeling like this?
p643
aVThat\u2019s the thing, I started vaping because I started to get fidgety, mood swings, difficulty concentrating... I\u2019m so mad at myself because I\u2019m trying to write a paper as we speak, and couldn\u2019t concentrate, so I just took two puffs of a JUUL, and was so mad at myself. I mean, comparatively, my normal habit is vaping from the moment I wake up (like, literally the first thing I do when I open my eyes is reach for my vape) to the moment I go to bed. Sucks that I gave in, but I\u2019m happy I stopped myself at 2, and that I waited a while before giving in... the craving is definitely still there but I satisfied my body a tiny bit so it would shut the hell up. And now I feel like I\u2019m just coming up with excuses for giving in. This sucks. Counter reset, and knowing myself I doubt it\u2019ll be the last time. But you know what, as long as the time between resetting the counter keeps getting longer and longer, I consider that progress. In all of my past attempts, me caving was me going all out and vaping for 10 minutes straight, and then continuing use as usual... not this time though, it\u2019s weird, it feels different. I\u2019ve never actually been this upset with myself for giving in, I really wanted this time to be the final time, and I gave in (albeit not as badly) so early... 19 hours... I\u2019m so weak man...
p644
aVAbout to give in... need help\u000a\u000aThe cravings are so bad right now. This will be day 2 (I relapsed earlier in the week) and it\u2019s just... ugh. I know it gets better, but spring break is almost up, meaning it\u2019s time to get back to the semester. I have no idea how I\u2019m going to handle it with these cravings, it\u2019s such an added level of stress that I really don\u2019t need, even though I know that the stress is from the nicotine withdrawal. It doesn\u2019t help that my dumb ass developed the habit of vaping while doing work or writing a paper, it\u2019s going to be so hardI\u2019m quitting vaping, and it doesn\u2019t help that there are 3 people who JUUL in my house, or that I can make a hookah whenever I want (Arab), or that my roomate has a JUUL too back at school, it\u2019s just too easy to break. There\u2019s a JUUL sitting on the kitchen table right now that I could go use. Part of me wants to stay strong, I want to prove to myself that I can do it, and that same part of me is screaming at me to not go use the JUUL even if it\u2019s just one hit, because that will just make me have to start over. But at the same time... I don\u2019t really believe that vaping is bad for me, so I think that part of me rationalizes the \u201cjust one hit\u201d thought process I have, even though I know it\u2019s just going to be a cycle. In one of my past attempts, I even tried to convince myself that I could just taper down and uses that as justification for buying a pack of pods... lol. Cold turkey is the only way for me. Patches are not an option because a) I\u2019m quitting because of the nicotine, not just the vapor. There is a risk of heart disease in my family and I don\u2019t need to be using something like nicotine, making that worse, and b) money. I go through a pack of pods in about 2 days. That\u2019s $20 every 2 days, basically a pack a day, even though each pack has 4 pods which are supposed to be equivalent to the nicotine in one pack of cigarettes. It\u2019s pretty bad. My hope was writing this would take long enough to distract me... but no, it took me 20 minutes to write this damn post and it\u2019s only worse. And I just ate, an obvious trigger for me, makes food feel so nice in my stomach. I\u2019m about to go crazy, this feels like I\u2019m stuck in the come up of acid, the tingling feeling in my body and head that I can\u2019t quite put my finger on or get rid of, except unlike acid, I know how to get rid of the feeling now. Please help. I have all my reasons for quitting written down but I just stare at them.. they\u2019re just meaningless words, not motivators, when my body and mind are in this state. Sorry for any spelling or grammar errors, I can\u2019t be bothered to proofread right now
p645
aVProps. I haven\u2019t begun myself, I keep pushing it back because I feel like quitting would make my semester hell, but at some point, I have to accept that there may not be a best time, and just quit. On the other hand, it is much harder for me because I don\u2019t actually smoke cigarettes, I vape (~5 years), which presents a problem because I can hit it anywhere I\u2019d like. Not to mention the fact that pretty much everyone has a JUUL (shout out to all the idiots getting addicted to nicotine for the buzz that\u2019ll disappear in a week or two) or box mod these days, making it too easy to succumb and take a drag or two. I always feel like shit after I do. I tried quitting twice this past year, longest was 6 days, failed both times because I got drunk and my roomate succumbed to my begging for his JUUL, even though I told him not to. I ended up convincing him to quit too, though, so we\u2019re both going to do it together. I feel that may make it easier. I hate myself for ever starting, to be honest. I wanna punch 15 year old me in the face. What a dumbass.

p647
aVDude, get a juul or some other vape. It makes quitting so much less stressful and then lowering the nicotine levels is easy when you're ready. 
p648
aVRight here w you pal. Honesty, going the vape route isn't a bad way to go. Invest in a juul or a phix and taper down from that
p649
aVHey man,\u000a\u000aI suggest dropping the nicotine down.\u000a\u000aI vaped juul for around 2 years, which is about 50mg nicotine. About two days ago, I dropped the nicotine content down to 3mg (by refilling the pods with 3mg juice, which is a **94%** decrease in nicotine from the previous amount.\u000a\u000aI was afraid it would be too much, but it isn't (this is about my 4th attempt at quitting vaping. Other times i was doing cold turkey) \u000a\u000aNot only is the flavor better, but the withdrawals are curved just enough for me. They are still there, but it's alot easier than quitting cold turkey. \u000a\u000aNot only that, but eventually cut down to 0mg juice (if you're already on 3mg). I'm going to vape 3mg nicotine for around 2 more days or so, then bump down to 0mg. The act of vaping itself (actually inhaling the vapor) is very relaxing, even with 0mg nicotine.\u000a\u000aI suggest, if you are vaping with a big box vape that blows cumulonimbus clouds, to buy something that blows smaller clouds that you can refill with less nicotine. Work your way down from there.\u000a\u000aI've been eating more, and I have a bit more energy, too. My skin feels less dry as well. The biggest withdrawal I had was brain fog (my brain felt like it didn't work yesterday, could barely think) but that's just *me*, and everyone withdrawals are different. \u000a\u000a\u000a

aVI was kinda in the same boat. I ended up getting a Juul pen because someone on this sub recommended it. I\u2019ve been using it for about a week and it\u2019s been great. It doesn\u2019t produce a lot of vapor so it\u2019s discreet and I feel it\u2019s giving me enough nicotine to keep cravings at bay. I was a pack a day smoker; and each \u201cpod\u201d, which contains roughly the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes, last me about 2-2.5 days. The pods come in packs of 4 and are roughly $15-$17 a pack, depending on the flavor. It charges via usb and lasts me about a day or so per charge. \u000aPM me if you have any questions-

aVWeaning off nicotine\u000a\u000aI have been a constant juul smoker for two years (ripping it all throughout the day pretty much every day) and I finally decided to quit 5 days ago. I don\u2019t want to be reliant on nicotine anymore. I tried going cold turkey for two days, but given that I was loading my system with such high concentrations of nicotine so often, withdrawal was not pretty. I then opted for a much better plan: weaning off the juul gradually by switching lower and lower mgs of nicotine in a vape. However, I am unsure as to how much time I should give myself to adjust to each different amount of nicotine before I go on to the next. Juul has 59 mg/ml of nicotine, and I am currently using a vape with 35 mgs (for three days so far). How long should I use this concentration before I go on to the next? Any advice would be very helpful and much appreciated. Thanks a lot

aVQuit for 4 months my friends got me a juul\u000a\u000aSO I don't know if this is allowed on this forum but basically, I am really upset at myself and beating myself down over this. I was a smoker for 6 years ( on and off for about 8 months). I started at 14 and am 20 now. I quit four months ago cold turkey and the other week someone found a juul at my job and I took it (i know i am gross but i disinfected the pod but still gross). It was perfect timing as my girlfriend left for New York for four months and I feel sad, alone and lonely. Unfortunately went and got new pods today. \u000aI feel myself slipping back into my addiction and I hate it. Have smoked a pod now and maybe a bit more. Any words of wisdom? Should I just finish smoking the pods and give up again once this stressful part of my life passes by? 
p653
aVthis sounds innocent but the problem is that you re-activate your nicotine receptors and these guys don't give a shit if you deliver the juice using a juul or by smoking. so it's a risky game. i'd suggest to ditch it.
p654
aVI\u2019m currently using the juul. It has allowed me to go down to 2 cigs a day, to now none. It\u2019s my 5 day today. I still pull on it frequently, but slowly I\u2019m gonna decrease the amount. Hopefully, I can successfully drop nicotine all together. \u000a\u000aI still feel better without all the other junk that\u2019s in cigarettes. 
p655
aVIf you don't mind the nicotine, a juul is a great and safer alternative although not harmless of course. No smell, no disgust, less lung issues. 
p656
aVStarted in college for fun, now I think I\u2019m actually addicted\u000a\u000aHello everyone so I began smoking and using the Juul(pod a day) on a daily basis my freshman year I hated it at first and began to slowly become fond of nicotine.  Now I\u2019m in my second semester of sophomore year and I literally can not go a day without it... I think it is because the Juul allows me to take multiple hits in my dorm before sleeping, when waking up, driving. Etc.  I\u2019m getting a little worried because I\u2019m begging to feel actually addicted now, not the \u201cI\u2019m sooo addicted\u201d everyone is always saying jokingly at college but true true addiction.  Any advice on how to stop?  I can\u2019t bring myself to throw away a Juul I\u2019ve spent a lot of money on but I think that might be the only way.\u000aThanks 
p657
aVcollege student here, I gave my juul to a friend. I felt the same but I\u2019ve saved 30 bucks on pods in eight days so try to justify it that way- it\u2019s hard but you\u2019ll notice the money saved
p658
aVYou're already adicted, no question. The longer you continue, the harder it will be to quit. Also, you might have wasted money on whatever the fuck a Juul is but imagine all the money you'll continue to waste if you don't quit now
p659
aVHaving problems with your juul vape or how to clean and for more information\u000a\u000a
p660
aVThere comes some maintenance with vaping. The thing that helped me quit was the Juul vape. Heres a video I made about it for information. Its also about the size of a normal cigarette so its not too obnoxious.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnEeh7Is4Fw&amp;t=1s
p661
aVFirst day of stopping JUUL\u000a\u000aI have tried quitting before, but this time has been the most serious. I'm welcome here if I'm trying to quit a vape and not smoking right? Shits still addictive cause you can do it anywhere no problem.\u000a\u000aEverything is so fucking irritating. I just wanna go to sleep, but I'm at school right now. Threw my juul in a bag in a bush yesterday. I got this.
p662
aVHey guys- I'm a "new" to Reddit, though a long time lurker. I quit yesterday, but I am using the JUUL. It's still so, so hard. I made it. I did cry once lol but just woke up, day 2. I hate the empty feeling... but what I hate more is that I even have that. Who is using vaping to help?\u000a\u000a Even with NRT it's rough, and that makes me feel so weak. \u000a17 years a smoker, and I'm 32. I'm so done. I have two kids that need me. I just wish I could turn every craving off from my brain. I've tried to quit twice before a long time ago, but I'm definitely way more "ready" this time. 
p663
aVI am also using a juul and haven't had a cigarette in 5 weeks. Last week was a rough one but I've managed. \u000a\u000aIt gets better. \u000a\u000aI find myself not even desiring a cig because I know how gross it'l make me feel 
p664
aVHang in there I'm 38 and trying this same as you I have one kid. And looking at 40 coming up and being in the same boat as you at 30 32 34 36 up until now I can only imagine what it would be like if I had just stuck with it years ago and quit I probably wouldn't be worried about or even know what the fuck a juul was. You can do it I can do it and whoever else is reading this cigarettes suck and it sucks 2 feel like you need something all the time
p665
aVYou can do it. Your future self is thanking you right now for being strong and doing the right thing. \u000a\u000aJuul is pretty nice, mint is my favorite cuz I smoked menthols and I like the mango to switch it up every now and then.\u000a\u000aGood luck!
p666
aVHave you tried vaping? The nicotine in a Juul can be pretty fucking intense but it's been proven to be at least wayyyy healthier than smoking.
p667
aVToday marked 31 days without cigarettes\u000a\u000aI've been using a juul, which I know many on here would consider cheating. But this is the longest I've gone without smoking in at least a couple years, so I still consider it quite good. This is the first time that I really feel I don't want to smoke again. Here's hoping for the best.
p668
aVIt's not cheating to use a JUUL (imo). I've been using a vape to cut down on smoking and have been doing both for almost a year. Today I've taken the first step and thrown my stinkies away. Vaping isn't proven to be harmless, that's true. But personally I'd rather take the risk than know I'm harming myself with cigarettes! Do what you need to do to drop your bad habit and congrats on 31 days!
p669
aVGet a juul, you won\u2019t look back. Worked since mid-Dec for me. Get off the cigs first, work on the nic later.\u000a
p670
aVas an idiot who got addicted to juul and not cigs, how have you gone about quitting vaping/nicotine only and is there really a point health wise in your opinion? I mean, i'm puffing on these good ass cucumber pods right now and on the one hand, being addicted to something is bad but on the other hand, it doesn't seem very harmful at all. I don't know, I'm 17 and these shits are everywhere, i feel like if i get rid of mine ill just be bumming off of friends for a few months and end up buying another.
p671
aVGet a vape that allows you to dial back the levels until you get it to 0. Juul is for smokers trying to stop cigs, not kids.\u000a\u000aYou have a different problem than OP.\u000a
p672
aVThis will sound counterintuitive, but lecture him LESS about smoking. Get on his was LESS. there are many ways to help someone quit, but they have to want to quit. In my previously failed attempts to quit (I'm finally doing it, but it took several attempts), friends and family preaching about how bad for you it is just made me want to light up even more. \u000a\u000aSmokers know smoking is bad for them and telling them how bad it is and not to do it is like asking someone to NOT think about a purple penguin wearing a tuxedo in an Applebees parking lot. Naturally the first thing we do is the very opposite. \u000a\u000aGet him a juul or some salt nicotine vape. They require next to no maintenance and buying new pods isn't that much more expensive than buying tobacco everyday (well the juul is a *little* more expensive in the long haul, but hopefully he will like it enough to not need to sort out the details). \u000a\u000aI wish you luck. 
p673
aVI\u2019ve got a Juul. The pods are essentially a single pack a day (5mg). I\u2019ve gone from a full pack in 24 hours to a pod every few days. Restricting your intake that way might be the answer. I\u2019m not sure what else to say except to try to get control back. 
p674
aVExtreme full body shaking after going cold turkey\u000a\u000aOkay so I don\u2019t have much because this just happened and I can\u2019t find much online that makes any sense so I\u2019m wondering if it could be this.. I know it\u2019s not smoking but I figured I\u2019d get more help here, I\u2019ve been using a juul for the past year and a half, going through a few pods a week normally. Recently I sold mine to a good friend (he bought it overpriced for me) because I\u2019ve come into some money problems.. can anyone tell me if this kind of severe full body shaking could be caused by nicotine withdrawals after going cold turkey? Thank you :)
p675
aVFirst of all.. don\u2019t be so down on yourself. Nicotine is a hell of a drug and makes you do funny things. I\u2019ve been in the same exact position as you. My brother recently told me about JUUL and I know it\u2019s a substitute but you can slowly diminish the amount of nic in it till you\u2019re free. I bought one today and it is the closest thing to dragging a cigarette I\u2019ve had. Haven\u2019t had the need or want to light one up all day. 
p676
aVYeah... the ones made by JUUL are. It\u2019s damn easy to refill with whatever you please if you do some research.
p677
aVCouldn't figure out how to have the picture and text lol.  The worst two days were the last two, I had awful itch to buy a pack when I was checking out at convenience store.  My lungs feel clearer and I've been exercising.  I use a Juul but have only really gone through a pod in two weeks so I think I'm doing well there.  Good luck to all
p678
aVGood luck. To me the vape is much more addicting than cigs although it\u2019s healthier. The reason is I can vape anywhere. I\u2019d constantly be hitting my nicotine packed Juul. \u000a\u000aIt\u2019s hard. Very. You\u2019ll notice that everything you did, literally everything, you\u2019d be vaping while doing it.\u000a\u000aWatching TV? Vaping. Computer? Vaping. Bathroom? Vaping. Driving? Vaping. Doing Schoolwork? Vaping. Just woke up? Vaping.
p679
aVI quit on the first and have been using a juul here and there. It definitely is faaarrr less damaging. I get the argument against it but I\u2019ve tried enough times without and never made it very far. I\u2019m at 2 weeks and having the juul when things get crazy or around other smokers while having a beer just makes the transition much easier and has a much higher success rate.\u000a\u000aI know I\u2019ll have to fight that too but just nicotine seems to be easier than an actual cigarette and all of the chemicals in that. \u000a\u000aSome people here view it as cheating but, I don\u2019t. I view it as an advantage.
p680
aVAnyone use ecigs to help quit?\u000a\u000aBeen a pack a day for theast 7-8 years, went cold turkey the day before New year's. So I guess I haven't smoked a cig all year lol. But I have been using disposable ecigs when I drink to get through it, and recently bought a juul to help to save money on buying disposables. Been going well so far but what do y'all think about the whole ecig thing? I know nictone is still going in but I am doing so much better. \u000a\u000aThanks for the input guys.
p681
aVThe problem with a juul is the juice is very strong. I think a cartridge is as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes. And you can't buy different strengths. People find themselves as addicted to the juul as they were to cigarettes, if not more. I think it is better to get a tank system vape and you can gradually reduce the nicotine content to the ultimate goal of 0. 
p682
aVDoes using a Juul e-cigarette count?\u000a\u000a
p683
aVIMHO yes. I am attempting to quit juuls as I type this. Day 5 here. Just as hard as quitting cigarettes except you don\u2019t get all the immediate benefits that you notice when you stop breathing smoke into your lungs.\u000a\u000aOn one hand juuls are good because you\u2019re not getting the tar / smoke on the other I found myself using them way more frequently and likely increased my nicotine intake significantly. The addiction was just as strong.\u000a\u000aTLDR: If you plan to keep smoking juuls aren\u2019t bad from a harm reduction POV. If you plan on quitting, skip the juuls and just get it over with.
p684
aVDay 3 of no Juul\u000a\u000a[removed]
p685
aVGood on you! Nicotine addiction is nicotine addiction, whether it been cigs or vapes. \u000a\u000aFrom my experience with vaping, I always end up smoking more. Partly because it's basically unlimited until you run out of juice. And then I always ended up smoking cigs too because vaping just made me want a cig.\u000a\u000aMy brother has one of those and I tried it during Christmas break. I used to smoke black and milds (and inhale every puff, as embarrassing it is to say) and one small puff out of that Juul and I was coughing up a lung. I was so surprised. \u000a\u000aCongrats on making the decision to quit! We can do it!
