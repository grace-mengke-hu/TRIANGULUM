VWhen I\u2019m high and get a buzz from a sourin (e-cig) I get way more light headed than if I was not high, so the nicotine doesn\u2019t make the weed intense but the weed makes the nic intense 
p1
aVNot sure if you\u2019ve already considered it but I\u2019d highly recommend vaping. You don\u2019t need to spend a lot or get a huge mod id suggest a small all in one kit with some salt nicotine juice. Something like the aspire breeze, sourin air/drop. Going in to your local shop and just asking questions could be the first step towards being cigarette free. \u000a\u000aI don\u2019t know to much about the benefits of CBD but If you want to try it out I\u2019d say go for it.

aVI\u2019m using 2 of those 3 right now! The puffco and suorin drop are awesome!
p4
aVAgreed, puffco gets a bad rap for their batteries but function on low setting is pretty legit and loading is simplest I've ever seen. Sourin is hands down my favorite though. Always in my pocket

aV4.8 G Nug In The Ounce I Got (Suorin Drop for Comparison)
p6
aVGet it. Its the best I usually take moles (tobacco and weed in a bong) and never crave it because of the Juul. My cousin is a heavy cigarette smoker and showed her the juul. Now her and all her friends have a juul. Personally I use a sourin drop because juul pods are expensive. I know a lot about e-cigs so dm me if you have in questions.
p7
aVNo sorry best you can get is some money off autoship. If your looking for something cheaper look into the sourin drop or air. 
p8
aVThis only happens to me when I take hits from my suorin (e-vape)\u000a\u000aBut when I smoke or hit from my pen I get the exact opposite
p9
aVNice sourin drop
p10
aVJust quit nicotine and got rid of my sourin drop. :( Enjoy your week!
p11
aVThe juul is super easy to refill, and there are videos online, the only problem is I notice (for me at least) that the pod leaks afterwards when you hit it. I got a suorin drop and it refills much better, but I'm not sure if you can put thc juice in it if that's what you're looking for.
p12
aVBest CBD e-juice for Sourin products?
p13
aVGround score! Also, love you're rocking a Suorin!
p14
aVWhat flavor you got for your suorin bruh?
p15
aVAyy I\u2019m also rocking a suorin, I have both the drop and the air and they\u2019re amazing!
p16
aVYeah I think suorin have a much cleaner hit. but nothing will come close to hat mango taste.
p17
aVOh God yes. I have a Sourin Drop (Kind of like a Juul, in that it is small and has a high nicotine content) and when I'm high I go at it nonstop
p18
aVSourin and other vapes eliminate coughing after dabs.
p19
aVMaking distillate E-juice for a Suorin drop?
