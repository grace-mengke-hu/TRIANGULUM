Vi was 100% in the same boat as you although with my phix. nicotine wd is a bitch but after day 3-4 you will be happy you're off it. good luck :)

aVI Lost My Juul and I\u2019m Tempted to go buy a Phix
p2
aVI\u2019m confused by what you mean were you trying to make a joke with phix and fix? Should I buy it or no
p3
aVI wasn't trying to make a joke, but it is interesting that a drug delivery device was name "phix".\u000a\u000aI encourage you to stop using nicotine in any form. No cigs, vape, ecig, dip, snus, and so on.
p4
aVYeah but I\u2019m a college student who often finds himself around bars with teenagers smoking. I try hard not to ask but I always do and a device like a Phix is better than being a bum.
p5
aVRight here w you pal. Honesty, going the vape route isn't a bad way to go. Invest in a juul or a phix and taper down from that
p6
aVFor me quitting cigs was easier then my fucking phix dude, i was so addicted to nic it was crazy. those cool melon pods were my heroin
