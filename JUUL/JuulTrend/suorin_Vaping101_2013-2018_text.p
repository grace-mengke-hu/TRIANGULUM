aVRefillable Pod Mod Recommendations\u000a\u000aI need help with some pod mod recommendations. I have a phix, juul, sourin air, drop, and i-share, aspire breeze and also the smok fit and infinix. I wanted to know if there are any pod mods that are refillable but keep that small and sleek design like the juul. I was looking at the rubi by kandypens but it's expensive and I've heard they can break easily.
p2
aVObviously depends on how much tugging on it, if I'm hitting it consistently throughout the day I would say 2 - 3 days. I've got mods and pods everywhere, I take a tugs everywhere, So a consistent start to finish, I wouldn't be the best example of that timeline.\u000a\u000aIt's like the Breeze and the Suorin Air,  It seems like days, and the smock Novo same thing.. \U0001f385\U0001f3fb\U0001f4a8

aVsourin Air pods running dry after a day\u000a\u000aSo this has been something that has happened like the last three pods I\u2019ve used, but no matter how long I let the pod sit it gets burned on the side that doesn\u2019t touch the juice. Any Tips will help thanks!
p4
aVUnfortunately, with all sourin I\u2019ve used, mine and friends, this is a recurring problem. One thing to combat it is to open the juice fill hole every few hits and it adjust the pressure and pushes the justice through to the other side of the wick. This may work, but I\u2019d suggest a new pod device like the novo. 
p5
aVEjuice expired?\u000a\u000aI\u2019m at my uncles house and currently own a Suorin Air. I packed a full pod of juice and I just ran out. My uncle offered me his vape juice. It was clear before and now it\u2019s brown-ish. I have no clue if it\u2019s expired or not..... and if it is, is it still safe to vape?

aVSuorin Novo Charging Prick Loose\u000a\u000aYesterday, I purchased a Suorin Novo and it was working perfectly until the battery died. When I went to charge it, the light became a solid red, signifying it was charging. After an hour, when I tried to hit it the light flashed blue. I removed the pod and noticed that although one of the two pricks that connect the battery to the novo was sturdy, one was loose and sunk lower than the other. Is there any way to fix this? I'd prefer to not have to purchase a new battery if possible. Let me know and thanks for the help.

aVInterested in getting a box mod\u000a\u000aSo I\u2019ve only ever used tiny refillable cartridges like the juul and suorin drop but I want to start using a box mod but don\u2019t know the maintenance process of it.

p10
aVI have tried a good amount of them and just keep going back to the Sourin Drop. The draw is pretty tight and in the morning, like coffee I look forward to that morning sting. 
p11
aVI can not recommend the iShare from Suorin enough. It comes with 2 independent pod systems and a battery to charge/house them. Each system is about the length of an average cigarette, and is draw activated, so no accidental firing in your pocket. I carry 2 setups on me(one for nic, one for flavor and clouds), and my iShare has been my go-to for nic hits for a bout 8 months now.

aVSmok 22 vape pen leaking, not safe to use???\u000a\u000aI am relatively new to vaping. I have heard people bash Smok products because they leak. I have the Smok 22 vape pen and know not to leave it charging to long so it doesn't blow up or anything. But it leaks. Should I get something else? It leaked out of the fire button and yes I made sure the coil was in very tight. I am assuming I should get rid of it :(\u000a\u000aI also have a Yocan Hive 2.0 which I will use in the meantime. What is your recommendation for a "safe" device? I was thinking about a Suorin Air or Suorin Drop, or possibly an Aspire Breeze. Additionally, do you have safety tips that new users might not be aware of?\u000a\u000aI have heard of devices firing out of nowhere or exploding and I would like to avoid that if possible.
p16
aVThe sourin pods are garbage. I like the draw on the air but I had pods that tasted burnt in two hours. Sometimes longer.\u000a\u000aI also just bought the innokin eq pod system on directvapor for fifteen dollars which is a steal. Has good reviews on here too. Good luck with whichever you choose 
p17
aVSuorin air question\u000a\u000aI used a suorin air for several months with no problem but I got this juice that was 50/50 which is Apparently bad for it, the first couple of pods it was just a really hard draw and this while hitting it the light would fade in and out with the draw and then stopped working all together. I took it apart and didn\u2019t see any leaking. Could I just buy a different juice and new pods or do I need a new device? 
p18
aVYou could buy a spare cartridge for around 4$ and the vape juice that's best for it is somewhere around 65VG/35PG or 70/30, if you dont have that kind of juice I recommend you get some if you want to have a good experience with the device.\u000a\u000aLink for US: https://www.vapewild.com/suorin-air-replacement-pod-cartridge/\u000a\u000aI couldnt find a UK/EU link but I'm sure it's easy to find if you live there.
p19
aVI used the suorin for several months with 60/40 and it was fine, my only thing is I don\u2019t know if buying just new juice and carts will be ok because I don\u2019t want to have to buy new carts juice and device.
p20
aVBest 60/40 or 70/30 salt nic specific brands? Suorin Air.\u000a\u000aYour text post (optional).
p21
aV70/30 and 60/40 are both recommended by Suorin for the air
p22
aVDo not be afraid of low cost items, especially these days. There are many, MANY excellent pod systems out there for sub 50.00 or even bellow 30.00. So here is a crash course...  \u000a\u000a\u000aThe Suorin Air (and most other suorin products.) Is a pod system ( a device that use refillable, disposable 'pods' rather than coils) that is very simple and easy to use. They come in a verity of styles and colors and usually cost about 30 bucks.   \u000aThey are prone to leakage of e-liquid that can flood the hit sensor and cause issues like auto firing or bricking.   \u000a\u000a\u000aThe Smok novo so far has proved to be a pretty solid device, but I have always felt that flavor is lacking or even tainted by the type of cotton they are using.   \u000a\u000a\u000aMy personal recommendation is the Innokin EQ. It is low cost, uses a firing button so no issues with hit sensors. The pods are very easy to refill and the overall cost is in the 30 dollar range. It has been one of the better devices that my shop has sold in the last year. So far we have yet to have a return of any issue, the flavor is on point and the ease of use is a 10.  
p23
aVI have my Smoan s8, and my backup suorin Air.
p24
aVIf you want the hit without the large clouds or the amount of smell, your best bet is going with a low output saltnic device. Natilus AIO, mipod, the sourin pods. High saltnic will give you the hit, and the pods are very low output. You have to really try to get anything resembling a cloud.\u000a\u000aThe low output/ low smell is how people get away with using them in places they shouldn't (work, class, etc.)
p25
aVbest guess is like a 650mah 3.7V battery. you could get like a kanger evod or t3d, maybe an aspire k1 tank. It wouldn't be a good setup. most people these days use those batteries for THC pre-filled cartridges.   \u000a\u000a\u000aIf you want something small and easy to carry and use I recommend pod systems. You've probably heard of the Juul, they suck, get a refillable pod system like the Mi Pod or a Suorin or the Renova Zero, Lostvape Orion Lots of great options. nic level depends on how much you smoke.  salt nic just is great, you won't have to vape all day and it feels just like smoking.  I like a 30mg salt nic, the Juul is 55mg there are all sorts of juices out there. I like Fuzzy Man by Zen Nic Salts its a Mango, Peach, Kiwi shit is bomb af
p26
aVTo add to this I'd recommend the Suorin Vagon over the Drop or Air. It's a lot more versatile in terms of the juices you can use and while I've never tried the Drop I know the Vagon has better flavour than the Air.
p27
aVI like the Suorin Drop. Draw-to-fire, ridiculously pocket-friendly, and absolutely *sips* juice. 2ml tank I think, but with the small built-in battery you'll probably need to recharge twice before you need to refill your pod. So you might need to buy 2 to get you through a long day or night of heavy use if you can't access a charger, which is micro-usb unfortunately.
p28
aVSourin air or sourin drop. They only last about 3 months before dying but there 20$ and the amount of money saved by changing from the Juul makes up for it 10x
p29
aVSmok Novo or Nord is great! Or the Suorin Drop. Good luck.

aVSuorin Air, Drop, or IQ OVS?\u000a\u000ai\u2019ve had 4 Suorin Airs so far, all of which have broken or stopped working due to old age or the auto firing issue. it\u2019s my favorite device out of all the pod systems i\u2019ve tried, but i\u2019m tired of dropping $25 on a new one every couple of months. i\u2019ve heard good things about the IQ OVS because of its \u201calmost indestructible\u201d design, but i\u2019ve also heard that the pods are sort of hard to come by in your random smoke shops and vape shops, so i\u2019m also considering the Drop, which i\u2019ve heard is sort of a step-up from the Air. does anyone have any experience with the OVS? is the Drop really a step up from the Air? should i just buy another Air since every pod system has its own list of problems?

p35
aVSomething that doesn't leak or burn out right away. \u000aThe suorin air pods usually last me a week or more I really like that 
p36
aVYeah.  I'd definitely see if you can get a different one.  It's not uncommon at all for a SMOK product to arrive dead or live for a week and call it quits.\u000a\u000aIf you have to grab a new one, I'd try out the Suorin Vagon if you use nic salts.  I've used one for about 4 months(ish) now and enjoy it a lot.  I seem to get better flavor from it than the Drop, Tesla's Tpod, and the BSKR kit from Vandy Vape. Just don't drop it, but I feel like all pod setups will have issues after dropping.
p37
aVThanks for the recommendation! Turns out all i had to do was have my sister throw it at me and poof it works. Sadly my sourin air slipped under the stove though, but i guess everything happends for a reason. Thanks for the advice!
p38
aVYour best bet is to get a pod system for salts if you insist on using them. Smok novo or sourin drop can be found in shops for 35-40$ \u000a
p39
aVI would personally recommend a pod system, such as a Suorin Air or an Aspire Breeze 2. Check vapecrawler to find the best prices.
p40
aVI\u2019d say to start you should try the new pod systems. Pod systems are basically small rechargeable devices that have an internal battery and a pod and that\u2019s it. Most of them automatically fire when you pull and that\u2019s as simple as it gets. They are easy and carry and great to save money. Coming to money, pod systems nowadays are extremely cheap and a nic salt bottle can last you weeks (depending on use) for example, I bought a Sourin Air about a week ago and two 30ml bottle of juices. Cost me about $46 but now I am set till almost New Years and some more. So if you\u2019re coming back to Vaping and want to save money, pod devices are the way to go. For starting, I would recommend you look at the Sourin line up (Air, Drop etc) .\u000a\u000aP.S Nic salts are concentrated nicotine juices but when used with a pod style device, it gives the same hit/feeling as a cigarette.
p41
aVI\u2019d say the Sourin Air. It\u2019s been working great for me. But then again I have only had the chance to use 2 pod systems (the air and the Juul). The pods for air are cheap too and they last upto 7-10 refills from what I have heard.
p42
aVI have both a suorin Air &amp; a Innokin EQ. I like both for different reason . Air is a smoother hit. I-EQ has more flavor, and 2 modes so you can use any Eliquid (not just nic salts) \u000a\u000aI also waiting for my Smok Nord to ship in, watched a couple reviews, and it\u2019s looking like the king of the hill of pod systems, I\u2019ll let you know when I get it. 
p43
aVHow much flavor should I expect from vaping?\u000a\u000aI haven't been vaping for too long but I have a few devices and different juices and I'm wondering if the amount of flavor I experience is normal for a sub ohm tank. I keep feeling like I'm doing something wrong. I know RDAs have better flavor but I'm not looking to get one just yet.\u000a\u000aTypically with my juices, they all smell incredible, but the taste is nowhere near as strong as I expected based on smell. I taste almost nothing on inhale, and theres always a hint of something on exhale. \u000a\u000aI've had the same experience with all my devices: Smok Rolo Badge, Suorin Drop, Vaporesso Revenger X and Uwell Nunchaku. I've tried different wattages and coils on the mods. \u000a\u000aJuiced I've tried: Keep It 100 Pink Burst, Reds Apple, Vape Wild Circus Bear, Banana Butt Left Cheek, and The Pancake House Maple. Varying levels of vg/pg and all 3mg nic.\u000a\u000aAs an example: with the Banana Butt juice, it smells exactly like a banana nut muffin. I was super excited for it. When vaping I get a hint of a nut muffin on exhale, and no banana at all. \u000a\u000aDo my experiences sound normal? Or am I missing out on flavor potential? Is it just because I'm a current smoker and my taste buds aren't as good as they should be?
p44
aVBuying suorin sur soon, need help with e-juice\u000a\u000aI'm going to buy a Suorin air soon cz it's easy on the wallet, however I am extremely confused as to what kind of juices I can use without damaging the device. I dont wanna use nic salts because I want to vape a nicotine strength of 0-3 mg and I prefer flavor variety that salt nicks just dont provide, I've read in some threads that I should buy high vg low pg juice, and on others I read the complete opposite. So i just wanted to know what juices can i buy that would definitely not damage my device.(ps I also need the juice to not be the most expensive)\u000a\u000aThanks
p45
aVHey I just found a review of the suorin that stated the following:\u000a\u000a "The manufacturer recommends that either 60/40 VG/PG or 70/30 eliquids are used in order to avoid leaking, and they even include an information card inside the box informing you of this, however I have had 18mg Digbys Apple and Cinnamon in there just fine with no leaking issues, and that has a 50/50 mix ratio."\u000a\u000aSo I guess I can use 50/50 or possibly 60/40VG to stay on the safe side of things, right?
p46
aVPLEASE help! Brand new Suorin Drop doesn\u2019t work.\u000a\u000aI got a brand new Suorin drop today and 70/30 juice (it says 30/70 on the bottle but the vape store owner said this is the one for the Suorin drop) for it. I let it charge for 20ish mins, the light blinked blue, took it off, filled it, waited about 5 mins, tried to hit, light inside flashed blue, but no vape. I took off the plastic seal btw and tried flipping the pod both directions and still won\u2019t work. It\u2019s hardly leaking either, some drops came out but even when i clean it all up, still won\u2019t work! There\u2019s some air bubbles in the pod from the juice, but i\u2019m not sure that\u2019s why it won\u2019t release any vapor or how to get rid of the bubbles. Any advice?? ALSO: when i try to inhale from it, the lights turn blue and i can smell the vape juice, but there\u2019s like stops of air through it, how can i fix that?? One of the times i tried to inhale some juice got in my mouth, very little.

aVAttempting to move from a suorin to a mod\u000a\u000aAfter trying out my friends mod I really like how it feels. I would like to upgrade to a mod but I\u2019m not sure which one would be the best. So far my internet research has led me to a kanger KONE starter kit, I\u2019m going to be using the same liquid as my friend. The Halo subzero menthol.

aVJust got my sourin air today\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve also been vaping less and less nicotine so I am going down to zero finally yay I am super proud of myself so...can you guys let me know where is there a good website to get vape juices that are good for my Sourin air?

aVSuorin Drop vs VooPoo Panda?\u000a\u000aHey guys,  I'm thinking about getting an ultra portable vape to take on the go with me so I don't have to take my DRAG out of the house.  I like VooPoo as a company but I've seen good things on the Suorin.  Any input is welcome! 
p50
aVAll of the devices here are sub par pod systems with the exception of the Juul.. I only say that because it works but is extremely expensive for most users.. The way they describe Smok products is complete and utter BS.. Same goes for Sourin. I'm not saying I have all the knowledge of pod systems but I have enough to know there are FAR better systems that should've made this list.  These wouldn't have even made my top 20.        It almost seems like they paid to have these on here given how ludacris this list is... I would recommend the Innokin EQ, The MI-pod or The Smoant S8.. Those are my top three and either one of them will serve you well, My Friend.
p51
aVGreat write-up! I\u2019ve never bought a Juul for this very reason. I always try to tell my friends how much cheaper it is, but maybe they\u2019re just too lazy to fill it up or try something new. I\u2019m currently using the sourin air and it\u2019s just as satisfying as the Juul imo
p52
aVI would recommend a pod based device, something like a suorin drop or vaporesso renova zero, you can check out some devices on [VaporOrigin.com](https://VaporOrigin.com) The site is easy to use and has all sorts of pod devices, smokers tend to like a throat hit and with a nicotine salt of 35mg to 50mg she'll be super happy! \u000a\u000a&amp;#x200B;\u000a\u000aHappy Thanksgiving!

aVMetal detectors and vape pens\u000a\u000aSo I live in Miami and because of all the school shootings and shit, my high-school decided to add a metal detector at the door and it wasn\u2019t a problem till everyone said fuck it and started vaping the most common vape is the Juul and we ended up accidentally walking through with it Bc we her high and forgot it was in our pockets now every one juuls in school but lately it\u2019s gotten crazy people are trying to sneak in crazy vape pens and some don\u2019t beep like a 300$ one that you can only get it in by wearing cargo shorts but that\u2019s besides the point. My question is if I go through the metal detector with my Sourin Drop will it cause it to beep or am I good ? ( keep in mind we\u2019re not allowed to bring book bags in school Bc of the shootings so I would need to bring it in my pocket)
