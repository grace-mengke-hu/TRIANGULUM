The training codes were written in Python 2.7.
- **label.py** contains the class labels and relation labels from TRIANGULUM.
# Conditional Random Field (CRF) Training
## Training from annotation dataset
- **CRFannot.py** firstly loads annotation data from given path to extracts CRF features, then train CRF model and test it on 2500 instances. Precision was calculated for each class.
- **CRFannot_6concepts.py** trains CRF model and test it on 2500 instances. The precisions for the 6 major class-concepts were calculated.
- **CRFannot_confusionMatrix.py** trains CRF model and test it on 2500 instances and generate confusion matrix.
- **CRFannot_crossVal.py** trains CRF model and test it using 3 fold cross validation method. 
- **CRFfeature.py** contains functions to extract CRF features from given sentence.
## Training from posts of the same author 
Each author with sequential posts sorted by time is treated as one data point.
- **CRFpostLevel.py** trains CRF model from list of authors with sequential posts to predict the changes of users' behavior.
- **CRFpostLevelUserCheck.py** calculate the number of users from post level training.
# LSTM Training 
## Training from annotation dataset
- **LSTMallPost.py** uses the entire annotation dataset to train LSTM model and employ this model to predit the class on Reddit cessation data.
- **LSTMannot_confusionMatrix.py** trains LSTM model on 70% of the annotation dataset then tests the model on 30% of the dataset then generate confusion matrix.
- **LSTMannotPrecisionRecall.py** trains and test LSTM model (70% training, 30% testing) and calculate precision and recall.
- **LSTMannotPrecisionRecall_concept.py** trains and test LSTM model (70% training, 30% testing) and calculate precision and recall on each class.
- **LSTMannotTest.py** testing code for LSTM training.
## Training from posts of the same author 
Each author with sequential posts sorted by time is treated as one data point.
- **LSTMpostLevel.py** trains LSTM model from list of authors with sequential posts to predict the changes of users' behavior.

# Rule-Based
- **RegExp.py** lists all the regular expression for Tobacco, Marijuana, and Vaping.
- **ruleBased.py** uses regular expression for Tabacco, Marijuana and Vaping to predict class label.
- **ruleBased_6concepts.py** uses regular expression for Tabacco, Marijuana and Vaping to predict class label, calculates precision and recall on 6 classes.
- **ruleBased.py_confusionMatix.py** uses regular expression for Tabacco, Marijuana and Vaping to predict class label, calculates confusion matrix.
# Relation Annotation Extraction
- **relationDataGen.py** firstly extract relations and corresponding phrases from annotation dataset, then calculate phrase vector from word2vec model as the feature vector.
- **relationDetect.py** uses phrase vectors as feature vectors to train and predict relations using multiple classifiers: SVM, MLP, rain forest, KNN, Naive Bayes.

# Performance Matric
- **performanceMetric.py** contains functions to calculate precision, recall, accuracy.
- **precision_recall.py** calculates precision and recall for each class.
- **precisionRecall.py** calculates precision and recall for 6 classes: 'VAPING_MJ','VAPING_NIC/TOBACCO','COMBUST_MJ','COMBUST_TOBACCO','BRAND','SMOKING_CESSATION'.
- **postTimeSort.py** sorts the posts by time stamp for each user, generates data points for post level training.
- **postTimeSortPerUser.py** sorts the posts by time stamp for each user and saves the data into dictionary.

# data folder
It includes data that generated in training and preprocessing.
